THE LONDON<br />
<span class="xlarge gesperrt">MERCURY</span></h2>

<p class="p0 center btb">Vol. I No. 1 <span class="in4"> November 1919</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDITORIAL NOTES</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">WITH</span> these notes we introduce the first number of the
<span class="smcap">London Mercury</span>. It might, beyond denial, appear in more
tranquil and comfortable days. We have just been through a
crisis which has brought us within sight of the basic realities
of life&mdash;food, clothing, housing, security against violence. As soon as the
paper was projected we were forced to visualise the likelihood of a time in
which paper would be almost unprocurable, printing impossible (save in an
amateur way at home), and the distribution of literature a matter of passing
sheets from hand to hand. We have had a glimpse into the abyss of disorganisation,
and, for the time being at all events, we have managed to keep on
the solid ground. But, having conceived this journal, its conductors would
have been reluctant to abandon their plans whatever confusion might have
supervened. They may fairly claim to have formulated a scheme which,
when it is perfectly executed, will meet all the demands of the public which
reads old or new books, and of that other and smaller public which is chiefly
concerned with the production of new works of the imagination. The more
intense the troubles of society, the more uncertain and dark the future, the
more obvious is the necessity for periodicals which hand on the torch of
culture and creative activity. Literature is of the spirit; and by the spirit
man lives. Our traditions are never more jealously to be cherished than
when they are threatened; and our literature is the repository of all our
traditions.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>We think that, with our list of contents before us, we may reasonably say
that there has never been in this country a paper with the scope of the
<span class="smcap">London Mercury</span>. We have had periodicals which have exercised a great
critical influence, such as the <i>Edinburgh Review</i> of Jeffrey's and Macaulay's
day. We have had periodicals which have published an unusual amount of
fine "creative work," such as Thackeray's <i>Cornhill</i>. We have at this day
the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i>, which reviews, with the utmost possible
approximation to completeness, the literary "output" of the time; we have
weekly papers which review the principal books and publish original verse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
and prose, and monthly papers which diversify their tables of contents
with articles on Molière or Chateaubriand, Byron or Mr. Alfred Noyes. But
we have had no paper which has combined as the <span class="smcap">London Mercury</span> will
do all those various kinds of matter which are required by the lover of
books and the practising writer. In our pages will be found original
verse and prose in a volume not possible to the weekly paper; full-length
literary essays such as have been found only in the politico-literary monthlies;
a critical survey of books of all kinds recently published; and other
"features," analogues to some of which may be found, one by one, here
and there, but which have never before been brought together within a
single cover. The <span class="smcap">London Mercury</span>&mdash;save in so far as it will publish
reasoned criticisms of political (as of other) books&mdash;will avoid politics.
It will concern itself with none of those issues which are the field of political
controversy, save only such&mdash;the teaching of English, the fostering of the
arts, the preservation of ancient monuments are examples&mdash;as impinge
directly upon the main sphere of its interests. But within the field that it
has chosen it will endeavour to be as exhaustive as is humanly possible.
The present number is an earnest of its intentions; in early future numbers
other sections will be added which will steadily bring it nearer to the ideal
that it has set out to reach.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>That ideal comprehends the satisfaction of the current needs of all those
who are intelligently interested in literature, in the drama, in the arts, and
in music. We shall attempt to make known the best that is being done and,
so far as literature is concerned, to assist the process by the publication
of original work. But thus far we have mentioned no more than the <span class="smcap">London
Mercury's</span> functions as what may be called a "news" paper, an organ for
the recording and dissemination of things that have already happened or
been done. Its functions, as its conductors conceive them, will include&mdash;and
this will be the chief of them&mdash;the examination of those conditions
which in the past have favoured, and in the future are likely to favour, the
production of artistic work of the first order, and the formulation and
application of sound critical standards.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>It is not a matter of attempting to make universal the shibboleths of some
coterie or school, or of carrying some technical "stunt" through the
country as though it were a fiery cross. We do not propose to maintain
(to give concrete examples) that literature <i>should</i> be didactic or that it
<i>should</i> be a-moral. We are not interested in urging that the couplet is exhausted,
that the sonnet should be revived, that plays should have four or
three acts, that rhyme is essential or that it is outworn, that lines should
or should not be of regular lengths. We are tied to no system of harmony;
we have no dogmas as to the dominance of representation in painting; we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
would make no hard-and-fast rule about the desirability of drawing a vertical
wall as sloping at 45 degrees or of painting a man's face magenta and sage-green.
As convenient descriptions we do not object (save sometimes on grounds of
euphony) to the terms Futurist, Vorticist, Expressionist, post-Impressionist,
Cubist, Unanimist, Imagist: but we suspect them as banners and battle-cries,
for where they are used as such it is probable that fundamentals are being
forgotten. Our aim will be, as critics, to state and to reiterate what are the
motives, and what must be the dominant elements, of all good art, whatever
the medium and whatever the idiosyncrasies of the artist, even if he find it
convenient to draw on papier-mâché with a red-hot poker, and even if his
natural genius impels him to write in lines of one syllable. The profoundest
truths about art, whether literary or pictorial, are crystallised in maxims
which may have been more often reiterated than understood, but which
have undeniably been so often repeated that people now find them tiresome.
Of such are "fundamental brainwork," "emotion recollected in tranquillity,"
"the rhythmical creation of beauty," and "the eye on the object."
Each of these embodies truths, and there is indisputable truth also in the
statements that a poet should have an ear and that a painter should paint
what he sees. These things are platitudes; but a thing does not cease to be
true merely because it is trite, and it is disastrous to throw over the obvious
merely because it was obvious to one's grandfather. Yet men&mdash;and even
women&mdash;do such things. We have had in the last few years art, so called,
which sprang from every sort of impulse but the right one, and was governed
by every sort of conceptions but the right ones. We have had "styles"
which were mere protests and revulsions against other styles; "styles"
which were no more than flamboyant attempts at advertisement akin to
the shifting lights of the electric night signs; authors who have forgotten
their true selves in the desperate search for remarkable selves; artists who
have refused to keep their eyes upon the object because it has been seen
before; musicians who have made, for novelty's sake, noises, and painters
who have made, for effect's sake, spectacles, which invited the attention of
those who make it their business to suppress public nuisances. We have
had also theories in vogue the effects of which on mind and heart were such,
and were foredoomed to be such, as to wither many talents in the bud. A
single positive trend in English literature we do not ask and it is not necessarily
desirable. We have heard the complaint from critics of the Gallic
school that even in the days of the marvellously fertile English "Romantic
generation" there was no one "movement," no Ten Commandments, and
everybody was at sixes and sevens. That is the national way, and it probably
accounts for our possession of the greatest and most varied imaginative
literature that exists. Nevertheless, anarchy is not desirable, nor that
worthy frame of mind which extends toleration not merely to the good of
all kinds, but to the good and the bad, the intelligent and the foolish
indifferently. And surely this toleration has been too commonly in evidence
in this country in our time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
Is the contention disputed? Is the fact other than self-evident? Is it
necessary to explain and to accentuate the confusion which for the last
ten years has been evident in the creative and in the critical literature of
this country? There have been, as there always are, writers who have
cheerfully continued writing as their predecessors have written, serious
parodists of Milton, of Tennyson, and of George Eliot. These least of all
can be said to be in the tradition of English letters; for that tradition has
been a tradition of constant experiment and renovation. There has been a
central body of writers&mdash;from Mr. Hardy, Mr. Bridges, and Mr. Conrad
to the best of the younger poets&mdash;who have gone steadily along the sound
path, traditional yet experimental, personal yet sane. But there has been
also a large number of young writers who have strayed and lost themselves
amongst experiments, many of them foredoomed to sterility. Young men,
ignoring the fundamental truth expressed in the maxim, "Look in thy heart
and write," have attempted to make up poems (and pictures) "out of their
heads." Others, defying the obvious postulate that all good writing will
carry at least a superficial meaning to the intelligent reader, have invited
us to admire strings of disconnected words and images, meaningless and
even verbless. Others, turning their backs on those natural affections and
primary interests the repudiation of which means, and must always
mean, the death of the highest forms of literature, have concentrated upon
the subversion of every belief by which man lives. They have sapped at
the bases of every loyalty, and sneered at every code, oblivious to both
social welfare and social experience. They have been, such of them as
profess the moralistic preoccupation, very contemptuous of "clean living
and no thinking," but the dirty living and muddled thinking that they
have offered as a substitute have been no great improvement. They have
been, such of them as have the preoccupation of the artist, so anxious to
look at the abnormal and the recondite that they have forgotten what are
and must be the main elements of man's life and what the most conspicuous
features in man's landscape. We have had an orgy of undirected abnormality.
The old object of art was "what oft was said but ne'er so well
expressed"; the object of many of the new artists has been what was never
said before and could not possibly be expressed worse. The tricks of
abnormality have been learnt. Young simpletons who, twenty years ago,
would have been writing vapid magazine verses about moonrise and roses
have discovered that they have only to become incoherent, incomprehensible,
and unmetrical to be taken seriously. Bad writers will, without
intellectual or æsthetic impulse, pretend to burrow into psychological
(or physical) obscurities which are no more beyond the artist's purview
than anything else, provided he responds to them, but which have the
advantage for an insincere writer that they enable him to talk nonsense that
honest unsophisticated readers are unable to diagnose as nonsense. Year
after year we have new fungoid growths of feeble pretentious impostors who,
after a while, are superseded by their younger kindred; and year by year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
we see writers who actually have some intelligence and capacity for observation
and exact statement led astray into the stony and barren fields of
technical anarchism or the pitiful madhouse of moral antinomianism. At
bottom vanity and pretence are the worst of vices in a young writer, but
they may be encouraged or discouraged, even these; and we have seen times
and places in which black was called white.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Amid this luxuriant confusion the voices of critics at once sane and
informed have been few. For the most part our older critics have tended
to treat the younger generation as a howling menagerie of insensate young
beasts, and have failed to keep sufficiently closely in touch with production
to discriminate between the traditional and the anarchistic, the sincere
and the pretentious, the intelligent and the stupid, the healthy and the
vicious, the promising and the sterile. We have ourselves been frequently
amused and irritated at finding elderly men of letters alarmed at the "revolutionism
of the young," as manifested in Mr. A. or Mr. B., or asking,
bewildered, "why the young take Miss C. so seriously," when as a fact
A. and B. are merely rowdies of whose foolish books even the young buy
only fifty or sixty copies, and the fair C. is a person taken seriously by no
serious person of her own generation. Those critics, again, who are constantly
in touch with the fruits of the printing press have for the most part
got into a state of puzzlement in which they are not merely afraid to make
mistakes (lest what looks like a frog may turn out to be an angel), but in
which they have almost lost the habit of using their senses for the purpose
for which they were meant to be used. Everything is treated with respect.
Platitudinous rubbish&mdash;so welcome perhaps because it is so easily understood&mdash;is
treated as though Wordsworth had written it; hectic gibberish of
the silliest kind is honoured, at worst, with the sort of deferential reprimand
that is applicable to great genius when great genius shows a slight tendency
to kick over the traces. Even those of our reviews which do not ignore the
best contemporary work more often than not allocate just as much space
to the humbug and the <i>faux bon</i>. "The public, though dull, has not quite
such a skull," as Swinburne's limerick put it. Many bad authors are much
talked about but very little read, and critics who never write a line are
frequently sound when most of the professionals have gone clean off the
rails. Moreover, it is arguable&mdash;though we should not, without long consideration,
accept the argument&mdash;that no amount of misleading criticism
or bad example will ruin a man of strong natural genius, which implies
perceptions which will not be denied, and a well-defined positive character.
Nevertheless, even if we do not exaggerate the ill effects of haphazard and
timid or haphazard and reckless criticism, it is surely obvious that both
artists and their publics must gain if some of the rubbish can be cleared
away. The ship moves in spite of all the barnacles, and it does not lose
direction, but its progress might be less troublesome. We have often met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
persons who have distrusted all reviews because they have bought books
on the strength of extravagant reviews and been once bit. We have often
met people, too, who have procured what somebody (undeniably "intellectual")
has told them to be the latest and most vigorous and representative
work of imaginative literature, and, finding it distasteful, have come to the
conclusion that the "poets of the day" or the "novelists of to-morrow"
are not for them: turning back, then, to their Dickens or Browning or
Dionysius of Halicarnassus in the mood of that ghastly pessimist who said
that whenever a new book came out he read an old one. These readers
are typical of many, and the result of their existence is that the dissemination
of the best contemporary literature is (1) less wide than it might be and
(2) less rapid than it might be. There is, as a rule&mdash;in the economists' term&mdash;far
too great a "time-lag" in the making of the best reputations. A man
often writes for years before he is heard of by the mass of the cultivated
readers who are naturally predisposed to like his work, and do like it when
at last they meet it. In a nation so large, and with so immense a volume of
literary production, such numerous and diverse news-sheets, and such
congested and ill-arranged bookshops, this phenomenon is bound to exist
in some degree. But it may be minimised, and although we of the <span class="smcap">London
Mercury</span> cannot hope, and do not desire, to be judged by our aspirations
rather than by our performances, we may at least be permitted to say that
we shall do our utmost to contribute towards that end.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Even to disclaim an ambition for an infallible pontificate of letters must
savour of impertinence. We can only say that what our journal can do in
the way of affirming and applying principles of criticism, and giving a
conspectus of the best contemporary work, we shall attempt to do. Our
other functions we have already outlined, and a beginning is made in this
number. We have made no endeavour to arrange a dazzling shop-window
of names or "features" for our first number; whatever may be our readers'
views concerning this number we can at least assure them that the contributors
to subsequent numbers will be not less representative than those
here found, and that only a beginning has yet been made towards the
complete scheme that we have in view.</p>

<h2>THE SMILE OF THE SPHINX</h2>

<p class="center">By ROBERT NICHOLS</p>

<h3>I.</h3>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">LONG,</span> long ago there dwelt in the pleasant City-of-Towers a young
princess of immense riches and of such exceeding beauty that none
other could be compared to her. So famous, indeed, became the
riches of her beauty and her possessions, that were only less than her
beauty, that she was sought in marriage by every kind of personage. In three
moons the train of her suitors, or mounted upon gold-stencilled elephants,
tassel-fringed camels, palfries of Arabia, ponies of Astrakhan, mules of Nubia,
or faring but upon the Sandals-of-Nature along the Road-of-Advantage,
became so huge that the citizens of the City-of-Towers being eaten (albeit
at no small price) out of hearth and home, petitioned the princely father
of the damsel to mitigate, in whatever sort he should think fit, the good
fortune of their city, which, possessing such a treasure as the princess
Sa-adeh, the Bestower-of-Felicity, admitted to finding its pleasure rather
in reflecting upon the value of their jewel than in entertaining those who
came to steal it. The ever-benevolent Prince accordingly issued a decree
that no suitor was to approach the Princess save on the understanding that
if he failed to win her affections his head should pay the forfeit. Forthwith
ensued so remarkable a diminution in the number of her suitors that, in a
short while, only those whom the Light-of-Love's-Eyes had guided or
those whom the Three-thonged-Scourge-of-Need had driven remained
mounted or standing before the palace gates. Nor did these linger overlong,
for the heart of the Princess was less easily softened than that of the Executioner,
who with one sweep of the scimitar relieved the Lover of the Burden-of-Love
or severed the Needy from the Vessel-of-Need. Then the beautiful
Sa-adeh, the Bestower-of-Felicity, not unfatigued by such a succession of
maidenly preoccupations, determined that for a little she would forget the
Bonds-of-Necessity and atone somewhat to the citizens of the City-of-Towers
for the inconveniences she had brought them. To this end she
caused a special litter of cedar wood to be constructed, and, mounting
therein, sallied forth to bestow upon the citizens of the City-of-Towers
the hitherto-unseen and almost-unendurable beauty of her face.</p>

<p>Now it happened that in this city there was then dwelling a young scribe
by name Es-siddeeh, that is the Very Veracious. This youth, the height
of whose beauty was almost as remarkable as the depth of his wisdom, had
spent the greater number of his days in study; so much so, in fact, that he
had never cast his eyes upon a woman to love her, and this in spite of the
possession of an enchanting smile, Nature's gift to him, of the power of
which he was hardly conscious. Surrounded by parchments, having hung
about his neck many little scrolls, with his tablet laid across his knees,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
daily he sat in his window and, while the traffic flowed by and the crowd
shrilled more loudly than a flock of parokeets, raised not his eyes from his
papyrus nor regarded any sound but the squeaking of his stylus-reed.</p>

<p>Thus, then, was he sitting when the troating of horns and the bombilation of
gongs proclaimed the nearing of the Princess in her progress. But Es-siddeeh
paid this din no attention and, though the fantastic shadows of many majestically-apparelled
persons fell across his page, lifted not the Gatherers-of-Knowledge
from the Leaves-of-Enlightenment. Meanwhile Sa-adeh, lying in her
litter, enjoyed a certain satisfaction in the pleasurable recognition the gracious
bestowal of the sight of her countenance procured the citizens. This satisfaction
she told herself, as the procession advanced, was increased rather
than diminished by the spectacle of certain bleared scribes, who, with ears
already attached by cobwebs to the lintels of their doors, never lifted eyes
as she passed. "For," she reflected, "such insensibility affords me a
scale by which to gauge the pleasure I bestow elsewhere."</p>

<p>At this moment she arrived opposite Es-siddeeh's window.</p>

<p>Then the young scribe, feeling the gaze of another fixed upon him, looked
up. And the eyes of Es-siddeeh exchanged thoughts with the eyes of Sa-adeh.
When he bent to the tablet again, behold the words were to him but foolishness.
All the afternoon he sat there wondering why he had spent his youth
upon such things as now appeared to him the very vanity of vanities, colourless
and the occupation of the myopic. At evenfall, driven abroad by a
terrible restlessness, he wandered outside the walls of the city, but the
murmuring of the breeze through the groves did but increase his distraction.
Toward midnight he returned and, after spending the remainder of the
night without sleep, informed his parents of his intention to turn suitor.
Greatly perturbed, they besought him to relinquish so hopeless a project.
In vain! at the third hour he proceeded to the palace. The gates were
shut. When they did at last open he found himself face to face with the
Executioner. Involuntarily he recoiled.</p>

<p>"No alms will be given to-day," said the Reliever-of-Headaches.</p>

<p>"I have not come for alms. I wish to see the porter."</p>

<p>"I am the porter."</p>

<p>"I thought you were&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So I was. But now that job is at an end. The capacity to love as our
forefathers loved is passing away. Even a spirit of commercial enterprise
is lacking. The world goes from bad to worse. Yesterday I cut off the heads
of princes; to-day I open the door to mendicants. On no one is Fortune
harder than I."</p>

<p>"I find that last reflection," returned the scribe, "so general that I grow
convinced it must be true. But be of good cheer. Strange as it may seem,
I am the bearer of good tidings. There is every likelihood of your shortly
resuming your distinguished office&mdash;I have come as a suitor to the Princess."</p>

<p>"Have you, indeed? Ha, ha, ha! The coin is as good as earned....
However ... excuse my entertainment. I should not laugh; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
understand my heart goes out to you in your public-spirited endeavour not
to permit my office to lapse. Ah, if there were only more men of your
kidney, and yet ... I regret to have to add that you will not profit
me much. For make no mistake, I am a Republican; I believe that
handsome is as handsome does. It is therefore my custom to request a little
honorarium, in ratio to the means of my customer, in return for the service
I render him. For this is a service which is unique, in that he probably has
no servant in his suite trained to perform this duty for him, and it is besides
a service for which the requirement of one small fee cannot be described
as extortionate since the duty is one which being once satisfactorily performed
does not require to be repeated."</p>

<p>"But I have not yet incurred the penalty."</p>

<p>"You will. Be reassured and, having no troublesome misgivings on this
count, hand me that which in a few hours it will be too late for me to ask."</p>

<p>Es-siddeeh smiled. "Are you not paid by the Court?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I am," replied the other, softening, "and a beggarly wage it is, too,
which compels me to make these requisitions. However, since you seem,
for all your queer dress, a pleasant fellow, I will reduce my charge."</p>

<p>"Good. I feared I should never be able to pay&mdash;my means are so scanty."</p>

<p>"I should inform you that it is as well to pay because, if you do not, my
arm, unstrengthened by the sinews of charity, may not perform its office
with quite that address which is at once a delight to the spectators and a
matter of self-gratification to my customer."</p>

<p>"Your magnanimity," replied the scribe, giving the man a coin, "does
indeed bear witness to the superiority of your mind to its present situation
and deserves a reward. I hope you will see that I am not disappointed of an
interview."</p>

<p>Thereupon the Executioner conducted him into the palace and, leaving
him in an inner apartment, acquainted one of the attendant damsels with
the object of the scribe's visit.</p>

<p>For some time the maid regarded his dress dubiously.</p>

<p>"I should be grateful if you would inform the Princess of my arrival,
for I cannot say that I find the sound of the Executioner in the courtyard
below sharpening his scimitar on a wheel affords me as much pleasure as
by his expression it affords him."</p>

<p>She vanished through the curtains, and the following conversation was
borne to Es-siddeeh's ears:</p>

<p>"A young man calling himself the Very Veracious has arrived and sues
for an interview on the same subject as his forerunners."</p>

<p>"I cannot see him." The maid returned.</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Es-siddeeh, "that she is as beautiful as one red rose
in a garden of lilies."</p>

<p>"The compliment," he heard the Princess remark, "is a new one and is
graceful. Nevertheless dismiss him."</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Es-siddeeh, "that her wisdom has the wings of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
rukh, the eye of the falcon, the talons of the osprey, and the voice of the
dove."</p>

<p>"It is very remarkable," he heard the Princess remark, "that he should
so accurately describe my characteristics. He must be a diviner; since, as
far as I know, he has never seen me nor spoken to me. Nevertheless dismiss
him."</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Es-siddeeh&mdash;but he could not think of anything to tell
her and was sadly cast down. For his love, continuing to pain him, tortured
him as a sweet fire in his bosom. At length, bethinking himself of his wisdom,
he said in as brusque a tone as he could summon, "Tell her that I know
the answer to all secrets and that she will regret it if she dismiss me."</p>

<p>"How now?" cried the Princess, "is he so clever, and has such courage?
He will indeed be the Very Veracious if, possessing these answers, he
depart immediately, for then my womanish regret will indeed be sharp;
since of all humours, he has had the wit to see, this humour of curiosity
is the one most deeply implanted in us. Of what complexion is he?"</p>

<p>"He is of spare build; his hair is black and glossy as that of a black
panther; in his eyes there is a dark fire. His clothes are by no means
new, his fingers are stained with ink, and about his neck there is a necklace
of little scrolls."</p>

<p>"A necklace of little scrolls, did you say? Send him in."</p>

<p>Then Es-siddeeh stepped into her presence, and it was to him as if he
were a little planet drawn for the first time into the orbit of the sun.</p>

<p>She commanded him to be seated and plied him with various questions
concerning the value as an amulet of this or that precious stone, of the
pedigree of famous horses, music as Emotional Sound or as an Architecture,
and many other matters of a similar nature.</p>

<p>All these questions he answered not only discreetly, but with wit.</p>

<p>For some time she rested her eyes upon his face in a musing fashion.
Then, with a strange inflection, she asked, "What is love?"</p>

<p>"I have but just beheld the cause," he returned; "give me a little space
and I infer its properties as a consequence. At present I am troubled to know
whether the same vessel can contain both cause and consequence."</p>

<p>Not without haste, she assured him that she would consider her question
answered, and enquired, "Does it become thee to risk so wise a head
at the bidding of so foolish a heart?"</p>

<p>"It lay not, and does not lie, with me to make it becoming."</p>

<p>This answer did not appear to please her, for, moving her head, she
proceeded with an instant change of tone, "One thing I have ever desired
to know. What is the secret of the smile of the Sphinx?"</p>

<p>He was taken aback.</p>

<p>"What? Canst thou not answer, thou who didst assert that thou
hadst in thy bosom the answer to all secrets, O Very Veracious one?"</p>

<p>Seeing her smiling, he replied, "I have not seen the Sphinx unless I see
her now."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
"I perceive that thou canst not answer. Yet because of thy youth and
thy beauty I will spare thee."</p>

<p>"Spare me not, since before thou hast not spared me."</p>

<p>"Upon one condition:&mdash;that shouldst thou wish again to see me thou
shalt bring with thee the secret of the Sphinx's smile. And now, before thou
leavest me, because thou wert not as insensible as most scribes are wont to
be, but wast willing to assay to gain some knowledge of perfection from life
as well as from thy scrolls, I will give thee a token to take with thee."</p>

<p>At these words, as if some beneficent and invisible djinn had escaped
from his bottle, a spirit of strange sweetness seemed to fill the room. Strength
forsook the body of Es-siddeeh.</p>

<p>"Come hither," she murmured.</p>

<p>So Es-siddeeh went to her and bowed down with his face to the floor.</p>

<p>Then the Princess took him very gently in her arms and, raising his head,
placed one hand beneath his locks and the other over his eyes, and so kissed
him.</p>

<p>Now when Es-siddeeh felt the touch of her hands, cool as water lilies
upon him; smelled the delicate smell of her bosom, more mysterious than
any perfume of the mages; tasted her mouth's nectar, more precious than
the combed honey of the blessed in Paradise, then indeed he knew there
to be such a seal coldly pressed upon his heart that the stamp of it would
not be erased all the days of his life.</p>

<p>"Ah, merciless," said he, "thou hast indeed not spared me. Now must I
inevitably return."</p>

<p>"It was for that reason I gave it thee," she said.</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>He hurried home. He sold all his belongings.</p>

<p>His father, seeing him about to depart, cried, "Thou wilt break thy
mother's heart."</p>

<p>He could not reply.</p>

<p>His mother, watching him set out upon his mule with a slender bag of
coin in his hands, cursed him and the Princess.</p>

<p>He did not look back.</p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>After a journey of three moons he arrived before the Sphinx.</p>

<p>His first impression was that her countenance contained no such
difficult riddle as he had been led to suppose. The body of the Sphinx
was huge, her paws stretched in front formidable, her shoulders heavy. Her
bandeletted head sustained a wedge-fronted tiara. All this he took in
at a glance. Then he turned to the face. He had not expected it to be so
close to the ground and so open to inspection. The forehead he could
see was ample. The eyebrows, albeit contracted in a slight frown, were
high, arched, and wide, which lent the upper part of the face a frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
expression; but the reverie of the eyes, fixed on space, seemed somewhat
dimmed&mdash;as if an impalpable hand had interposed itself between the gazing
orbs and the sun. The smoothness and delicate moulding of the cheeks
and chin were remarkable. The nose astonished by the firm subtlety of its
outline, which gave to the face a simultaneous expression of suavity and
undeviating determination. If the nose had provoked wonder the mouth was
yet more amazing. The lips, which might have been gracious and full when
parted, were so closely compressed in their smile as to modify the whole
effect of the other features.</p>

<p>"I must go nearer," said Es-siddeeh.</p>

<p>He established himself almost between the paws of the monster, for
monster she had become to him who now beheld her mien more clearly&mdash;a
mien disfigured, yet seeming uncaring for its own disfigurement, and&mdash;greatest
horror of all&mdash;a mien in which the eyes possessed irises but seemingly
no pupils. For a little he considered returning. Then he said to himself,
"No; to see her afar off gives a false impression. One should see her as she
is, and earnestly scanning the visage wrestle in thought till one discovers
the secret of the smile." In this he instinctively knew himself to be right.</p>

<p>But he was not long in finding that the more and the closer he stared the
more difficult the problem became. To begin with the blemishes distracted
him overmuch. The main cast of the face appeared, though subtle, simple
and grand enough, but the fissures between the blocks that composed it, the
discolorations, and the crevices that ran from side to side confused his
eye. "If it were only perfect, all would be much easier to discover," he
murmured. Then, too, the expression of the Sphinx and the import of the
smile seemed to vary with the changes of the weather. On fresh-blowing
sunny days the image beamed on him with a shadow-dappled, bleached
cheerfulness of resignation. But when the sun raged the face, too, raged
as with an inward fury; its lineaments shook in the heat-eddies that arose
from the sand, and every grain glowed like a particle of fire. Nor did its
rage abate during the succeeding night. The rising of the tropic moon
gave to its complexion, streaked with violet shadows, an ashen hue: the
pallidity of an unappeasable and frustrated anger. On lowering days it
blackly scowled, and the swollen nostrils and imperious mouth assumed
the similitude of being endowed only with the bitterest irony, a constancy
of cruelty and an unquestionable scorn. Then he hated it....</p>

<p>At last, perceiving that the secret was not to be gained in a few days or
even in a few moons, he resolved to settle in the desert opposite the Sphinx.</p>

<p>Three years passed.</p>

<p>Day by day and night by night Es-siddeeh watched the Sphinx. Daily the
sun, shining upon the surface of the mask, seemed to make it more impenetrable,
and nightly the moon, deepening the shadows in the crevices, increased
its mystery. Round about the knoll, which the pilgrim had selected for
his station, the sand gave off a glare more deadly than the bed of a furnace
or, rising in whirlwind-spouts whose tops spattered ashes upon him, circled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
his island like monstrous and infuriate djinns. Toward sunset the clouds,
gathered in an awful and silent grandeur, discharged, with stunning clap
and reverberations as of mountains overthrown, their lightnings, a shower
of blue arrows, to all quarters of the fluttering horizon. Once indeed
Es-siddeeh awoke to behold a body of dense vapour launch itself wrathfully
downward against the head of the brooding Sphinx and wreath it with a
crown of crackling fire. The scribe leaped up, and, despite the pressure of
the blast, succeeded in gaining, not without considerable risk to himself,
a position before the base of the monster. His courage was unrewarded.
Upon that obstinate mien, livid in the tawny light, the rain glistened as if
there had indeed started from the stony pores a ghastly dew; but the thin
lips were as tightly compressed as ever. "Hideous Sphinx!" exclaimed the
youth, "thou cruelty incarnate, cannot even the ire of the gods subdue
thee? Shall I never, from some motion of thy visage, learn what secret thou
hidest?"</p>

<p>As the winter approached the wilderness, utterly denuded of weed or
moss, grew vaster and more bleak. The nights turned frosty. Overhead
the constellations increased in splendour and number until every
quarter of the empyrean shone encrusted with stars. Against these brilliant
galaxies and the diffused, pervasive effulgence of countless further bodies
the forehead of the Sphinx outlined itself in desolate and stubborn
majesty.</p>

<p>Then was it that, alone amid the desert, under the gaze of those myriad
and so distant lights, facing the figure of the Sphinx, now blacker and more
impenetrable than ever, Es-siddeeh reached the climacteric which is despair.
Baffled, without any sensation but an exasperation that gnawed his very
reins and made giddy his temples, he spent his days and nights in complete
dejection. At length, wishing, to terminate his sufferings once and for all
he approached the Sphinx and, vehemently hammering its breast with his
fists, cried in a terrible voice, "<i>What is the secret of thy smile, O Sphinx?</i>"</p>

<p>But the Sphinx did not answer.</p>

<p>At dawn, impotent before the titan, he perceived upon the surface of
her bosom bloodmarks hitherto unobserved. Other hands beside his own,
then, had knocked upon that stony breast. He returned to his hovel and
stretched himself down in a sleep that was like a stupor. On waking he
determined to climb the bandelettes of the Sphinx and to cast himself from
its forehead. He had scarcely taken a step when, exhausted by privation
and prolonged anguish of mind, he fell, and lying helpless found himself
fronting a face mirrored in a pool, the product of a shower which had
fallen while he slept. The face was the face of one whose visage was slowly
approximating to that of the Sphinx, but it lacked the smile, and in its
eyes there was the light of imminent insanity. For a space he gazed without
realising the apparition to be but his own reflection. Then&mdash;stiffening his
arms that he might raise his head and shoulders, extended, as he was, upon
the desert like a Syrian puma whose bowels are transfixed by an arrow and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
who is about to die&mdash;he rallied his strength for a last effort. Before him, a
quivering tigress in the meridian sunshine, crouched the colossal Sphinx.
The frustrated eyes of the scribe, nigh starting from their sockets, bent
upon it such a glare as sought to penetrate its very soul. Yet at the last,
heaving himself forward, with nostrils wrinkled and teeth bared as if in the
very coughing frenzy of a fighting death, he could but ejaculate "Sphinx,
now had I entreated thine aid!&mdash;hadst thou not rendered me too proud,
who have discovered thee to be but stone."</p>

<p>Then the Sphinx answered in a voice of thunder:</p>

<p>"O man, aid thyself!"</p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>A company of Bedawi, journeying across the desert, discovered him lying
senseless. Him they succoured as a madman, and therefore sacred to the gods.</p>

<p>For a while he rested in a pleasant city, enjoying the support of a good
man, who did not understand the cause of his afflictions, but at once realised
their intensity and the deep importance to Es-siddeeh of the search on
which he was engaged. His health mended at length and undeterred by
the solicitations of his host, troubled to see him in such haste, he resumed
his investigations. This time he did not attempt to wrestle the secret from
the Sphinx herself, but determined to prosecute his enquiries among the
learned.</p>

<p>With this end in view he interrogated the chief scholars of that district,
but, coming to the conclusion that they were too provincial, he made his
way to Jerusalem. Here no answer at all was given him&mdash;save that by the
study of the particular law made for a particular tribe and containing, as
he himself was obliged to admit, the most admirable rules for the preservation
of an individual or a clan, he would attain to a knowledge of all things.</p>

<p>He determined to go to Greece, the fountain-head of knowledge. But
in Athens he fared not much better. The majority of the inhabitants,
the fascination of whose minds he had nevertheless to admit, seemed given
up to the fervour of local politics, money-making, the quarrels of the law-courts,
the consideration of athletics, the technique of the chase, and the
refinement of trivial or voluptuous delights: pursuits which he told himself
could scarcely further true knowledge. There were, however, a number of
persons, given to the study of natural law as revealed in nature, who enquired
whether he had weighed the Sphinx or examined her molecules beneath
the magnifying crystal. He was compelled to reply that he had done neither
of these things. Whereat they retorted that it was therefore impossible for
them to build a theory as to the constituents of her smile and verify it in
experiment. "Moreover," they continued, "even the data you have given
us appear not only insufficient but contradictory, since you state that the
smile is at once sweet and sour. Direct opposites cannot be reconciled in
science. We think it therefore best to direct you to the school of metaphysics
opposite, where, if we are to judge from the uproar which occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
disturbs our precincts, we believe this feat to be daily accomplished." ...
Es-siddeeh accordingly lost no time in entering the school opposite. After
a lengthy session, the clamour of which somewhat bewildered him, a young
man with a high complexion and a shrill voice approached him and said,
"As far as can be ascertained (for there are the usual number of qualifications
and reservations of opinion amongst us) we are of a mind that the
secret of the Sphinx is that she has no secret&mdash;at least no secrets from us."</p>

<p>Es-siddeeh did not stop to enquire further, for it appeared to him that
he could not gain by it and, moreover, he was much fatigued. So, taking
boat, he sailed through the Pillars of Hercules and, turning north, descried,
after an arduous voyage, the extreme Western Isles enshrouded in a perpetual
prismatic fog. On these coasts he landed and, penetrating inland, in a short
while discovered a university situated on the chief river of the main island.
Having struck up an acquaintance with the courteous master of the chief
college, he poured out his tale. The Disseminator-of-Truth, after prolonged
thought, replied, "Without wishing in any way to influence your conduct,
I should, since you seem to be enamoured of the lady, inform her that the
secret is anything you happen to have in your head at the moment (as well
it may be), provided the matter be of such obscurity that that instinct which
is peculiar to females, and which on the best authority (namely, their own) I
am given to understand is infallible, will instantly assure her that she
understands it even better than you do."</p>

<p>"But you would not have me deceive her?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no. For recollect&mdash;what she believes to be true will <i>per contra</i>
be true to her."</p>

<p>"It seems to me, then, that you are asking her to deceive herself."</p>

<p>"Not at all," answered the Sage somewhat impatiently; "all is, you must
know, relative, and any conclusion is as relative to enquiry as any other."</p>

<p>"But not to truth!" returned Es-siddeeh with heat.</p>

<p>The great man smiled. "An irritating preoccupation this, when the
search itself is so intriguing."</p>

<p>Es-siddeeh, the Very Veracious, experienced a curious sensation in which
pleasure certainly played a part. "That is perfectly true," he remarked; "I
am finding more interest in the search than I expected. Nevertheless I wish
to return to Sa-adeh, the Bestower-of-Felicity" (and at her name he was
conscious of an inexplicable spasm of contrition), "and to present her with
my conclusion&mdash;the Truth."</p>

<p>"Here I think we part," said the other suddenly. "Farewell."</p>

<p>Then, as he turned away, the elder flung over his shoulder, "For myself,
old-fashioned being that I am, I am inclined to think the truth is that the
secret of the smile of the Sphinx is not one that should be repeated
to a lady."</p>

<p>It was some time before Es-siddeeh recovered from the shock of this
interview. When he had done so, he hastened to leave the country and to
betake himself to the Furthest East. The voyage lasted three years. But,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
when he posed his question to the head of a Manchu university, what was
his surprise to be countered with just such a suggestion as had been put
to him in the extreme Isles of the Western Hemisphere!</p>

<p>"But you forget my name," he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"No; for indeed so eager have you been to enquire of me the secret of
the Sphinx and to narrate to me the story of your quest that you have
forgotten to acquaint me with your name."</p>

<p>"I am named Es-siddeeh, which, being translated, is the Very Veracious."</p>

<p>"Then, my middle-aged young man of redoubtable veracity, I advise
you to abandon your quest and to despair at once. It is much quicker. In
such a mood you will discover yourself becoming most pleasantly the prey
of one of the unmarried maidens who abound hereabout and who, I assure
you, are not less beautiful and certainly less exacting than your friend.
For women, according to the sage's experience, are much the same the
whole world over&mdash;a morsel of honey in which the bee has left his sting:
without the sting no honey, and no honey no sting."</p>

<p>"Sir," replied the scribe, "I am much indebted to you, but you know
neither Sa-adeh nor the secret of the Sphinx."</p>

<p>"I do not indeed, but I venture to think that to propose to oneself a
question that cannot immediately be answered is not the conduct of a wise
man and may very well give offence to Powers of which we are becomingly
ignorant."</p>

<p>Utterly wearied by the enquiries he had prosecuted among the learned,
Es-siddeeh turned over in his mind the many types he had encountered
in his wanderings and, recollecting the lively intelligence of those Athenians
who were not of the learned professions, he determined to live after their
manner that perchance he might hap upon the secret. Several years were
spent in acquiring sufficient money. The subsequent spending taught him
that his mind was apt to wander from the problem in the mere enjoyment
of the moment. Before, however, he could make finally sure whether he
was any nearer gaining a solution he found himself ruined. Turned soldier,
he took part in many notable engagements and distinguished himself not a
little. The itch of the excitement of the search was for the time being
eclipsed by the perils and responsibilities of war. There were, too, other
distractions, nor were these invariably the bodiless preoccupations of the
mind.... It was the somewhat unpleasant termination of one of
these episodes which plunged him into reverie upon the past. At midnight,
silently rising from his rose-strewn couch, he determined there and then
to bring to the contemplation of the Sphinx that store of varied knowledge
which he had gathered in the course of his wanderings. Arrayed, then, in a
dress similar to that which he had worn as a youth and encircling his neck
with a necklace of scrolls he set out alone for the desert.</p>

<p>Since the way was long and he no longer young, a year passed ere he
approached his goal.</p>

<p>Then once again Es-siddeeh stood before the Sphinx.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<h3>V.</h3>

<p>In the moonlight it seemed to him that during his thirty years of absence
the image had grown larger. That his eyes, accustomed to watch for unexpected
perils, played him no tricks he was certain, yet he now observed
the brow of the Sphinx to be wreathed in a faint vapour as if its crest had
attained the altitude of no inconsiderable hill. The fissures between the
stones seemed slightly to have filled, but the crevices across the face were
both more numerous and more deeply scored. The pits of the eyes, too,
had become immensely more cavernous. And&mdash;could he be mistaken?&mdash;was
not the smile less ambiguous? Surely he did not remember the visage as
so noble, or had it grown nobler in his absence? How was it that, though
the aspect remained as unflinching as ever, the expression now seemed
less hard and more magnanimously stern? The cheeks had undoubtedly
sunk further, but did not the muscles appear tightened less in impatience
than in endurance of suffering? The nostrils no longer breathed scorn; they
laboured with the indrawing of breath that, like fire, was at once painful
and inspiriting. To the brow there had been added, he thought, a faint line,
and its coming had softened the contraction of the brows so that the creature
appeared even more majestic and wiser than of yore. And lastly&mdash;he took
long to discover this&mdash;in the shadow under the brows the orbs seemed
to stir with a mysterious and darkling life. "O mighty Sphinx," he
murmured, leaning his head upon her bosom, "what has come to thee?
How art thou changed! Much I fear thou hast passed beyond so small,
feeble, and ignoble an intelligence as I and that now I shall never learn
the secret that, behind thy lips, lies locked in thy heart. O Sphinx, if I
speak wilt thou answer? Time was when I came to thee and, impatiently
stamping my foot upon the mound of thy illimitable desert, beating with
my fists thine unanswering flesh, conjured thee in a voice of thunder to
yield up thy secret. But to-night, nestling against thy bosom, how shall
I speak to thee?&mdash;I, of less account among men than one of the myriad
morsels of dust out of which thou art compounded; I, whose voice is to
thine ears hardly louder than the scratch of the beetles that crawl about thy
base; I, lost in the shadowy cleft between thy breasts? O Sphinx, I will not
cry out to thine unregarding face, lost in such a reverie as transcends the
thought of such as myself, but leaning here my fevered forehead against
thy cool stones, as in a dream and scarcely expecting an answer, let me
whisper to thy heart, '<i>What is the secret of thy smile, O Sphinx?</i>'"</p>

<p>Then from within the Sphinx arose a deep murmuring as of a multitude
of nigh-forgotten voices; a handful of vapour parted from the lips to wither
in the glacial moonshine.</p>

<p>"Scarcely am I changed," said the Sphinx. "'Tis thou art changed.
Look in thy heart: there is my secret."</p>

<p>So low had been the sound, so immense was the night, so lonely the
desert, that Es-siddeeh doubted whether it was not his own heart that had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
spoken. Then, placing both hands against the breast of the colossus, he
cried in a despairing voice, "Is that thy all, O Sphinx?"</p>

<p>But there was no answer.</p>

<p>With spirit heavy as death, Es-siddeeh wrapped him in his cloak and laid
him down to sleep between the paws.</p>

<p>"Alas," said he to himself, "how brief, how obscure, and how profitless
seem all the answers given to man!" Yet, when the morning came, it
occurred to him that, if the Sphinx had indeed spoken, he would do well
to ponder the words.</p>

<p>So for three moons he sat pondering: "<i>Scarcely am I changed. 'Tis thou
art changed. Look in thy heart: there is my secret.</i>"</p>

<p>Those who crossed the desert marked him, sunk in the deepest travail
of thought.</p>

<p>"Why do you not look at the Sphinx?" they asked.</p>

<p>"I begin to know something about it: that is why," he replied. "If I
gazed at it always in the present and never in memory I should learn
nothing."</p>

<p>One day a young scribe of great beauty approached the Sphinx and in a
low tone enquired: "<i>What is the secret of thy smile, O Sphinx?</i>"</p>

<p>"Speak louder. She will not hear you," called his companion.</p>

<p>Es-siddeeh leaped to his feet.</p>

<p>"Who sent thee hither?" he cried.</p>

<p>"Sa-adeh, the Bestower-of-Felicity," answered the youth; and turning
to his comrade, "If you wish to know why I do not shout, know that it is
because I have read the early work of a certain scribe Es-siddeeh. It is very
evident that, as with many persons of original mind, he scarcely recognised
the full import of what he was at the time writing. Had he been acquainted
with more scholars and had more experience of life he would have spoken
with greater certainty. He would have also realised, too, I do not doubt,
that his work was not so vain as it then appeared to him. But he disappeared
and none knows whither, since his parents never spoke of him again. I,
taking up his work, have already carried it further, I think, than he had
when he abandoned it. Nevertheless I, too, have ceased to labour at it and
am come hither for the purpose thou knowest."</p>

<p>"Sa-adeh," echoed Es-siddeeh, waking as if from a dream; "I seem to
remember that name. Tell me now, how did you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the stranger, receiving no reply from the Sphinx, had departed.</p>

<p>Es-siddeeh sat him down again in dejection.</p>

<p>That night he did not sleep. The memory of Sa-adeh overcame him
with tears. All his life passed in review. Never had his reverie seemed so
bitter, his questioning so futile as on that midnight, yet toward dawn he
suddenly stood up with a shout. An immeasurable serenity flooded his
being.</p>

<p>"I have it," he cried; "I have solved the secret of thy smile, O Sphinx!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
At that moment the tropic sun arose, and in its rays he beheld the face of
the tormentor shine with an equable and golden splendour. The eyes, no
longer lacking pupils, possessed sight, and from the smile had vanished
all that he detested.</p>

<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>A new porter, a garrulous and slipshod wastrel, had taken the place of
the old. It appeared that nowadays the Princess had but few visitors despite
the fact that she was acknowledged almost as beautiful as ever, albeit in a
different style. Her temperament, he learned, was difficult, her wealth
greater than ever.</p>

<p>After but short delay he found himself in the antechamber. He acquainted
the damsel with his mission. She vanished through the curtains, and the
following conversation was borne to Es-siddeeh's ears:</p>

<p>"An old man, calling himself the Very Veracious, has arrived and sues
for an interview on the same subject as his forerunners."</p>

<p>"I cannot see him." The maid returned.</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Es-siddeeh, "that she is as beautiful as one red rose in
a garden of lilies."</p>

<p>"The compliment," he heard the Princess remark, "though graceful,
is not new; in fact so old that I scarcely distinctly recollect when I made a
fashion for it. Dismiss him."</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Es-siddeeh, "that her wisdom has the wings of the
rukh, the eye of the falcon, the talons of the osprey, and the voice of the dove."</p>

<p>"The Very Veracious," he heard the Princess remark, "is there very much
in the wrong. If I have learned nothing else in my life I have at least learned
that my wisdom has no such enviable characteristics. Dismiss him."</p>

<p>"Tell her," said Es-siddeeh, suddenly overcome with a novel misgiving,
"that I know the answer to all secrets, including the secret of the smile of
the Sphinx."</p>

<p>"How original!" cried the Princess. "Does he really know the secret
of the Sphinx's smile? Send him in."</p>

<p>Es-siddeeh went in and bowed down.</p>

<p>"Though changed," he said, "O Sa-adeh, you are as beautiful
as ever."</p>

<p>"Your beard has grown so long and so white," she answered, "that&mdash;surely
thou <i>art</i> the (what is the name?) the Es-siddeeh I once knew, are
you not?"</p>

<p>"I am."</p>

<p>"And you know all secrets?"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>Then she plied him with various questions concerning the value as an
amulet of this or that precious stone, of the pedigree of famous horses, of
music as an Emotional Sound or as an Architecture, and many other matters
of a similar nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
All these questions he answered with such a considerable wealth of
detail that Sa-adeh appeared confused. Both fell silent.</p>

<p>After her eyes had rested for some time upon his face in a musing fashion,
she asked with a strange inflection, "What is love?"</p>

<p>He was dumbfounded.</p>

<p>"I believe you have forgotten," she said, and in the intonation of her
voice there was a hint of the equivocal.</p>

<p>His eyes filled with tears. "I have not forgotten," he said; "perhaps I
am only just beginning to learn."</p>

<p>She gave him a curious look; then, moving her head, proceeded with
an instant change of tone, "Well, what is the secret of the smile of the
Sphinx?"</p>

<p>A wave of emotion swept over him. He smiled and arose.</p>

<p>"With the details of my enquiry I will not trouble you. Suffice it to say
that for nearly forty years I have been searching."</p>

<p>"So long as that?"</p>

<p>"Many hard early days I spent in the desert and endured great privations."</p>

<p>"Indeed? I am sorry. Forget them."</p>

<p>"I would not if I could&mdash;they were the price of knowledge. At one time
I came near losing my wits."</p>

<p>"So? I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Then I spent some years interrogating the wisest of earth."</p>

<p>"Oh?"</p>

<p>"But met with no answer."</p>

<p>"Ah."</p>

<p>"Then I spent further years in acquiring money&mdash;years of misery they
were and years of degradation&mdash;that I might discover the secret. I was
ruined. I repeat, I was ruined."</p>

<p>"Pardon me. Yes, you were ruined. I am sorry."</p>

<p>"I served as a soldier. I received wounds. I was captive. I was beaten.
I escaped. I rose to power. I exploited all modes of living and fulfilling
myself, but my experiments brought me no nearer the secret."</p>

<p>"No nearer...."</p>

<p>"Then I set forth on a dreary journey to renew my memory of the Sphinx's
face. I sat down beside her. For a long time I learned nothing&mdash;the smile
seemed hardly less mysterious than it had ever been. Then&mdash;but you are
not listening...."</p>

<p>"My friend, I am indeed; you were on a dreary journey and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"At length one day a youth&mdash;but I will not burden you with that, though
it was strange...."</p>

<p>"Why do you look so at me? I am listening."</p>

<p>"That night I learned the secret of the Sphinx."</p>

<p>"At last!"</p>

<p>"I learned it indeed."</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, what is it?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
"A difficult matter. You must listen most carefully, so subtle is its sense;
yet in its comprehension lies hid the whole secret of man's possible happiness."</p>

<p>"I am listening."</p>

<p>There was a great stillness in the chamber. Es-siddeeh closed his eyes
to concentrate his thought. Then, opening them, he began:</p>

<p>"I learned the secret&mdash;that smile is the secret."</p>

<p>"So I supposed."</p>

<p>"Hush, or I shall begin to think that you do not know how to value this
gift of my whole life, which I am making you. It is very difficult, but if all
men would listen to me their lives would be easier."</p>

<p>"I thought the secret was for me&mdash;yet no matter. Proceed. You see how
serious I am."</p>

<p>"I learned its secret."</p>

<p>His lips trembled. He could hardly speak; at last with a great effort he
said, "Now it comes&mdash;<i>upon maintaining that smile, which is the sign of the
power of her existence, all her energy is bent</i>. She did not tell me, but I found
it written in my heart. For what is she? <i>In the Sphinx, with her ravaged
countenance and mutilated smile, I behold Life itself&mdash;Life in mysterious might,
ignorant of its own origin, conscious only of its own beauty, couchant amid the
wilderness of space and eternity.</i>"</p>

<p>"Is the smile of the Sphinx all that indeed? I somehow thought it was
something more intimate. But how serious you look! Do not frown&mdash;I
would not offend you for the world."</p>

<p>"Should I not smile?" he said bitterly.</p>

<p>"Yes, like the Sphinx."</p>

<p>"Quick! How, did you know that?"</p>

<p>"Don't frighten me. I was but speaking idly."</p>

<p>"Idly?"</p>

<p>"Seriously then, if you like&mdash;since you attach such importance to it.
Women always work by miracles and never know when they have performed
one.... Excellent, you are smiling, though your smile is ambiguous."</p>

<p>"I do but obey her."</p>

<p>"Not me?"</p>

<p>"That smile which we behold on her face is the smile we see everywhere
about us; only in her it has become more august&mdash;first by reason of her
greater consciousness of isolation in the Desert and beneath the Stars, and,
secondly, by consciousness of her strength."</p>

<p>"Will you hand me my fan? Thank you."</p>

<p>"For what are not the properties of the smile&mdash;the sovereign beauty, the
witness of power&mdash;in Nature? Wise indeed the man who knows the bounds
of what it is capable. When we are born the first thing we behold is a smile:
the Nurse smiles at us, and in that smile we should read&mdash;were we then
capable&mdash;the self-satisfaction of Nature, proud of her reproductive powers,
who dandles us in her hands with the assurance that she knows what is best for
us. Ah, how universal is the smile! Think of the variety of smiles that exist.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
'Tis all for smiles this life! And that is at once its apparent cruelty and its
final justification. On the blackness of Eternity it expands in a smile like a
rainbow&mdash;a rainbow whose arch begins and ends, as rainbow arches do,
uncertain where. And this blossoming in Infinity justifies itself....
How? By the beauty of its smile. Therefore smile. Smile and be in harmony
with&mdash;if not the spirit of the Universe (for the unknown looking down from
the Hill of Heaven upon the Rainbow may for all we know smile also, and
on the import of that smile opinion may be divided), and be in harmony at
least with the beauty of that fragment of the Universe which, if we do not
wholly comprehend, we can at least worship and imitate.... But you
are yawning."</p>

<p>"No, obedient to you, I was&mdash;smiling."</p>

<p>"And for how long? Until we are resolved&mdash;as the drops of the rainbow
are resolved after refracting supernal colours. Yet as a raindrop glitters, ere
it evaporate upon the flower and be again (who knows?) drawn up in the
immense cycle, with some reflection of the glory which its passage served
to make, so should we maintain that smile to the moment of our dissolution.
As indeed I, whose stormy aerial passage is nearly over, shall do till I attain
to mine. For what commoner solace do we hear than that '<i>he died with a
smile upon his face</i>'? Such a smile may each have at his passing! How happy
our friends will be to see it, how confounded our enemies! How comforted,
too, the philosophers, who will not fail to perceive in it the reflection of
whatever faith they hold: the ineffable joy of one whose beatified wings
even now mingle with the wings of other spirits in divine assumption;
the satisfaction of the racked, whom never again the torturers Joy and Sorrow
will wake from endless sleep; the profound irony of one who never expected
his pleasures to last for ever; and the disdain, too proud to curve itself in a
full sneer, of one who opposes to the silent smile of the unknown a smile yet
more silent!"</p>

<p>He paused.</p>

<p>"I have been thinking," said the Princess.</p>

<p>"You wish to know more? Shall I explain?"</p>

<p>"No. It is unnecessary; all this amounts to that you wish to marry me,
and the announcement that you have earned the right to do so, but
I should inform you that since you were last here a gentleman, who as a
matter of fact once occupied a position menial enough but of importance
in this household, has by signal honesty and perseverance arrived at a
position where&mdash;well, in fact, to put it shortly, I have formed another
attachment."</p>

<p>"Madam, am I reft of my senses? You astonish me! Who?"</p>

<p>"The Executioner."</p>

<p>"Ah, heavens! Well, let me inform you, madam, that I, too, have
formed another attachment."</p>

<p>"You say that to my face! How dare you? But I saw directly you entered
this room that you had long ago forgotten what true love is. Your long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
absence from me bears it witness. Who, may I ask, is now the object of
your affections?"</p>

<p>"Do not smile&mdash;or smile, madam, if you can; I love the Sphinx."</p>

<p>He had but that moment discovered it.</p>

<p>The Princess shrieked and at the sound he bent upon her such a smile
as in memory effectually prevented her ever mentioning the Sphinx and its
secrets again to anyone.</p>

<p>Then he walked out.</p>

<h3>VII.</h3>

<p>He returned to the Sphinx.</p>

<p>While yet afar off he was puzzled beholding a mountain range arisen in
the wilderness. As he drew nearer he recognised it for the Sphinx. If during
his thirty years' wanderings she had appeared to increase in size, to what
dimensions had she not attained during his brief absence! The vapours of
the desert, rising about her, had collected upon her shoulders in a strata
of billowy cloud, and her head, unimaginably exalted, had now reached
such an altitude that the features were almost indistinguishable in the blaze
of the sun.</p>

<p>Night had fallen by the time that he stood within the canyon of her
breasts. For a little he rested his head upon the rock. A great weariness
descended upon him. Physical infirmity, the inevitable sequel of all he had
suffered in body and in soul, now made him its prey. His mind and spirit,
however, remained keen and unquenchable as ever. He wrapped himself
in his cloak and lay down. At midnight he awoke. For the first time the
Sphinx, speaking in a voice of more than mortal tenderness, had made
utterance without being addressed, "Art thou returned, my lover?"</p>

<p>"Thou seest me. All I love I have given thee."</p>

<p>"Few have bestowed upon me so much as thou. Fewer still have arrived
where thou hast arrived, while yet possessing the eye not wholly dimmed
and the tongue not altogether palsied. One thing, however, thou hast kept
from me&mdash;the seal that is on thy heart."</p>

<p>"Ah, Sphinx," replied Es-siddeeh, "that I cannot give; it is part of
myself. Nor would I&mdash;for it was that which first brought me hither to scan
thy face and to read thy riddle."</p>

<p>"I am a jealous lover."</p>

<p>"I know it. Yet what care I? Thy jealousy is a measure of my reward;
for though I have discovered thy secret in general, yet it is a secret which
no man perhaps will ever fathom in all particulars. Happy the hero who
attains as far as I, happier yet he who can gaze unwinkingly upon thee as I
do now, and hourly fathom something further!"</p>

<p>"I am a jealous lover. Thou hast not much longer to gaze."</p>

<p>"No matter. Eyes do not perish with me, and for myself I am rewarded."</p>

<p>Then was it that for Es-siddeeh the body and the face of the Sphinx
achieved a final apotheosis. Her limbs throbbed with a deep and terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
energy. From her breast issued an all embracing warmth similar to that
of the earth. Her breathing became distinct as an august and stupendous
rhythm resembling the ascent and descent of waters from firmament to
firmament. Her cheeks flushed with a youthful elation. Into her eyes arose
an immense light fixed upon unforetold futurities, and all her face, so worn
and beautiful, became more ravaged and even more beautiful&mdash;for the very
deepening scars, wasting and remoulding the features, gradually resolved the
visage into an ethereal harmony hitherto unknown. Around her head,
entangling in its mesh the nearer planets, there wreathed itself an enormous
halo, iridescent as that which encircles the frosty moon. Her whole being
exuded a supreme lustre until she became one living and colossal crystal
which distributed in refraction all the colours of the rainbow and which
palpitated with powers unguessed.</p>

<p>And to Es-siddeeh, who beheld her through the tears of one who momentarily
expects to be parted, the spectra and the palpitance appeared in triple.</p>

<p>"O Sphinx, O Life the Enchantress," he cried, "my true and only love,
take if thou wilt my heart and the seal upon it, for thine am I only, thee only
would I aid, thee only do I love, thee only would I worship!"</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A band of Arabs, journeying across the desert, found him, when dawn
came, lying between the paws of the giant&mdash;dead, more cold than the stone
which surrounded him and which now began to kindle in the morning rays.
Though there had been no dew, his garments were deluged as with the
falling of an immense tear. Upon his face there lingered a fixed smile, and,
gazing upward, they beheld its double in the sunlit face of the familiar
Sphinx.</p>

<h2>GEORGE ELIOT</h2>

<p class="center">By EDMUND GOSSE</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IN</span> and after 1876, when I was in the habit of walking from the northwest
of London towards Whitehall, I met several times, driven slowly
homewards, a victoria which contained a strange pair in whose appearance
I took a violent interest. The man, prematurely ageing, was
hirsute, rugged, satyr-like, gazing vivaciously to left and right; this was
George Henry Lewes. His companion was a large, thick-set sybil, dreamy
and immobile, whose massive features, somewhat grim when seen in profile,
were incongruously bordered by a hat, always in the height of the Paris
fashion, which in those days commonly included an immense ostrich
feather; this was George Eliot. The contrast between the solemnity of the
face and the frivolity of the head-gear had something pathetic and provincial
about it.</p>

<p>All this I mention, for what trifling value it may have, as a purely external
impression, since I never had the honour of speaking to the lady or to Lewes.
We had, my wife and I, common friends in the gifted family of Simcox&mdash;Edith
Simcox (who wrote ingeniously and learnedly under the pen-name
of H. Lawrenny) being an intimate in the household at the Priory. Thither,
indeed, I was vaguely invited, by word of mouth, to make my appearance
one Sunday, George Eliot having read some pages of mine with indulgence.
But I was shy, and yet should probably have obeyed the summons but
for an event which nobody foresaw. On the 18th of December, 1880, I
was present at a concert given, I think, in the Langham Hall, where I sat
just behind Mrs. Cross, as she had then become. It was chilly in the concert-room,
and I watched George Eliot, in manifest discomfort, drawing up and
tightening round her shoulders a white wool shawl. Four days later she was
dead, and I was sorry that I had never made my bow to her.</p>

<p>Her death caused a great sensation, for she had ruled the wide and
flourishing province of English prose fiction for ten years, since the death
of Dickens. Though she had a vast company of competitors, she did not
suffer through that period from the rivalry of one writer of her own class.
If the Brontës had lived, or Mrs. Gaskell, the case might have been different,
for George Eliot had neither the passion of <i>Jane Eyre</i> nor the perfection
of <i>Cranford</i>, but they were gone before we lost Dickens, and so was
Thackeray, who died while <i>Romola</i> was appearing. Charles Kingsley,
whose <span class="smcap">Westward Ho!</span> had just preceded her first appearance, had
unluckily turned into other and less congenial paths. Charles Reade,
whose <span class="smcap">It is Never Too Late to Mend</span> (1856) had been her harbinger, scarcely
maintained his position as her rival. Anthony Trollope, excellent craftsman
as he was, remained persistently and sensibly at a lower intellectual level.
Hence the field was free for George Eliot, who, without haste or hesitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
built up slowly such a reputation as no one in her own time could
approach.</p>

<p>The gay world, which forgets everything, has forgotten what a solemn,
what a portentous thing was the contemporary fame of George Eliot. It was
supported by the serious thinkers of the day, by the people who despised
mere novels, but regarded her writings as contributions to philosophical
literature. On the solitary occasion when I sat in company with Herbert
Spencer on the committee of the London Library he expressed a strong
objection to the purchase of fiction, and wished that for the London Library
no novels should be bought, "except, of course, those of George Eliot."
While she lived, critics compared her with Goethe, but to the disadvantage of
the sage of Weimar. People who started controversies about "evolutionism,"&mdash;a
favourite Victorian pastime,&mdash;bowed low at the mention of her name, and
her own sound good sense alone prevented her from being made the object
of a sort of priggish idolatry. A big-wig of that day remarked that "in
problems of life and thought which baffled Shakespeare her touch was
unfailing." For Lord Acton at her death "the sun had gone out," and
that exceedingly dogmatic historian observed, <i>ex cathedrâ</i>, that no writer
had "ever lived who had anything like her power of manifold but disinterested
and impartial sympathy. If Sophocles or Cervantes had lived in
the light of our culture, if Dante had prospered like Manzoni, George Eliot
might have had a rival." It is very dangerous to write like that. A reaction
is sure to follow, and in the case of this novelist, so modest and strenuous
herself, but so ridiculously overpraised by her friends, it came with
remarkable celerity.</p>

<p>The worship of an intellectual circle of admirers, reverberating upon a
dazzled and genuinely interested public, was not, however, even in its
palmiest days, quite unanimous. There were other strains of thought and
feeling making way, and other prophets were abroad. Robert Browning,
though an optimist, and too polite a man to oppose George Eliot publicly,
was impatient of her oracular manner. There was a struggle, not much
perceived on the surface of the reviews, between her faithful worshippers
and the new school of writers vaguely called preraphaelite. She loved
Matthew Arnold's poetry, and in that, as in so much else, she was wiser
and more clairvoyant than most of the people who surrounded her, but
Arnold presented an attitude of reserve with regard to her later novels.
She found nothing to praise or to attract her interest in the books of George
Meredith; on the other hand, Coventry Patmore, with his customary amusing
violence, voted her novels "sensational and improper." To D. G. Rossetti
they were "vulgarity personified," and his brother defined them as
"commonplace tempering the stuck-up." Swinburne repudiated <i>Romola</i>
with vigour as "absolutely false." I daresay that from several of these her
great contemporaries estimates of her work less harsh than these might be
culled, but I quote these to show that even at the height of her fame she
was not quite unchallenged.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
She was herself, it is impossible to deny, responsible for a good deal
of the tarnish which spread over the gold of her reputation. Her early
imaginative writings&mdash;in particular <i>Janet's Repentance</i>, <i>Adam Bede</i>, the
first two-thirds of <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>, and much of <i>Silas Marner</i>&mdash;had
a freshness, a bright vitality, which, if she could have kept it burnished,
would have preserved her from all effects of contemporary want of sympathy.
When we analyse the charm of the stories just mentioned, we find that it
consists very largely in their felicity of expressed reminiscence. There is
little evidence in them of the inventive faculty, but a great deal of the
reproductive. Now, we have to remember that contemporaries are quite in
the dark as to matters about which, after the publication of memoirs and
correspondence and recollections, later readers are exactly informed. We
may now know that Sir Christopher Cheverel closely reproduces the features
of a real Sir Roger Newdigate, and that Dinah Morris is Mrs. Samuel Evans
photographed, but readers of 1860 did not know that, and were at liberty to
conceive the unknown magician in the act of calling up a noble English
gentleman and a saintly Methodist preacher from the depths of her inner
consciousness. Whether this was so or not would not matter to anyone, if
George Eliot could have continued the act of pictorial reproduction without
flagging. The world would have long gazed with pleasure into the camera
obscura of Warwickshire, as she reeled off one dark picture after another,
but unhappily she was not contented with her success, and she aimed at
things beyond her reach.</p>

<p>Her failure, which was, after all (let us not exaggerate), the partial and
accidental failure of a great genius, began when she turned from passive
acts of memory to a strenuous exercise of intellect. If we had time and space,
it would be very interesting to study George Eliot's attitude towards that
mighty woman, the full-bosomed caryatid of romantic literature, who had
by a few years preceded her. When George Eliot was at the outset of her
own literary career, which as we know was much belated, George Sand
had already bewitched and thrilled and scandalised Europe for a generation.
The impact of the Frenchwoman's mind on that of her English contemporary
produced sparks or flashes of starry enthusiasm. George Eliot, in
1848, was "bowing before George Sand in eternal gratitude to that great
power of God manifested in her," and her praise of the French peasant-idyls
was unbounded. But when she herself began to write novels she grew
to be less and less in sympathy with the French romantic school. A French
critic of her own day laid down the axiom that "il faut bien que le roman
se rapproche de la poésie ou de la science." George Sand had thrown
herself unreservedly into the poetic camp. She acknowledged "mon instinct
m'eût poussée vers les abîmes," and she confessed, with that stalwart good
sense which carried her genius over so many marshy places, that her
temperament had often driven her, "au mépris de la raison ou de la
vérité morale," into pure romantic extravagance.</p>

<p>But George Eliot, whatever may have been her preliminary enthusiasms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
was radically and permanently anti-romantic. This was the source of her
strength and of her weakness; this, carefully examined, explains the soaring
and the sinking of her fame. Unlike George Sand, she kept to the facts;
she found that all her power quitted her at once if she dealt with imaginary
events and the clash of ideal passions. She had been drawn in her youth
to sincere admiration of the Indianas and Lelias of her florid French
contemporary, and we become aware that in the humdrum years
at Coventry, when the surroundings of her own life were arduous
and dusty, she felt a longing to spread her wings and fly up and out to
some dim Cloud-Cuckoo Land the confines of which were utterly
vague to her. The romantic method of Dumas, for instance, and even of
Walter Scott, appealed to her as a mode of escaping to dreamland from the
flatness and vulgarity of life under the "miserable reign of Mammon."
But she could not achieve such flights; her literary character was of a totally
different formation. What was fabulous, what was artificial, did not so much
strike her with disgust as render her paralysed. Her only escape from
mediocrity, she found, was to give a philosophical interest to common
themes. In consequence, as she advanced in life, and came more under the
influence of George Henry Lewes, she became less and less well disposed
towards the French fiction of her day, rejecting even Balzac, to whom she
seems, strangely enough, to have preferred Lessing. That Lessing and
Balzac should be names pronounced in relation itself throws a light on the
temper of the speaker.</p>

<p>Most novelists seem to have begun to tell stories almost as early as
musicians begin to trifle with the piano. The child keeps other children
awake, after nurse has gone about her business, by reeling off inventions in
the dark. But George Eliot showed, so far as records inform us, no such
aptitude in infancy or even in early youth. The history of her start as a
novel-writer is worthy of study. It appears that it was not until the autumn
of 1856 that she, "in a dreamy mood," fancied herself writing a story.
This was, I gather, immediately on her return from Germany, where she
had been touring about with Lewes, with whom she had now been living
for two years. Lewes said to her, "You have wit, description, and philosophy&mdash;those
go a good way towards the production of a novel," and he
encouraged her to write about the virtues and vices of the clergy, as she had
observed them at Griff and at Coventry. <i>Amos Barton</i> was the immediate
result, and the stately line of stories which was to close in <i>Daniel Deronda</i>
twenty years later was started on its brilliant career. But what of the author?
She was a storm-tried matron of thirty-seven, who had sub-edited the
<i>Westminster Review</i>, who had spent years in translating Strauss's <i>Life of
Jesus</i> and had sunk exhausted in a still more strenuous wrestling
with the <i>Tractatus Theologico-Politicus</i> of Spinoza, who had worked
with Delarive at Experimental Physics in Geneva, and who had censured,
as superficial, John Stuart Mill's treatment of Whewell's <i>Moral
Philosophy</i>. This heavily-built Miss Marian Evans, now dubiously known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
as Mrs. Lewes, whose features at that time are familiar to us by the admirable
paintings and drawings of Sir Frederick Burton, was in training to be a
social reformer, a moral philosopher, an apostle of the creed of Christendom,
an anti-theological professor, anything in the world rather than a writer
of idle tales.</p>

<p>But the tales proved to be a hundred-fold more attractive to the general
public than articles upon taxation or translations from German sceptics.
We all must allow that at last, however tardily and surprisingly, George
Eliot had discovered her true vocation. Let us consider in what capacity she
entered this field of fiction. She entered it as an observer of life more diligent
and more meticulous perhaps than any other living person. She entered
it also with a store of emotional experience and with a richness of moral
sensibility which were almost as unique. She had strong ethical prejudices,
and a wealth of recollected examples by which she could justify them. Her
memory was accurate, minute, and well-arranged, and she had always
enjoyed retrospection and encouraged herself in the cultivation of it. She
was very sympathetic, very tolerant, and although she had lived in the very
Temple of Priggishness with her Brays and her Hennells and her Sibrees,
she remained singularly simple and unaffected. Rather sad, one pictures
her in 1856, rather dreamy, burdened with an excess of purely intellectual
preoccupation, wandering over Europe consumed by a constant, but unconfessed,
nostalgia for her own country, coming back to it with a sense that
the Avon was lovelier than the Arno. Suddenly, in that "dreamy mood,"
there comes over her a desire to build up again the homes of her childhood,
to forget all about Rousseau and experimental physics, and to reconstruct
the "dear old quaintnesses" of the Arbury of twenty-five years before.</p>

<p>If we wish to see what it was which this mature philosopher and earnest
critic of behaviour had to produce for the surprise of her readers, we may
examine the description of the farm at Donnithorne in <i>Adam Bede</i>.
The solemn lady, who might seem such a terror to ill-doers, had yet a
packet of the most delicious fondants in the pocket of her bombazine
gown. The names of these sweetmeats, which were of a flavour and a texture
delicious to the tongue, might be Mrs. Poyser or Lizzie Jerome or the
sisters Dodson, but they all came from the Warwickshire factory at Griff,
and they were all manufactured with the sugar and spice of memory. So
long as George Eliot lived in the past, and extracted her honey from those
wonderful cottage gardens which fill her early pages with their colour and
their odour, the solidity and weight of her intellectual methods in other
fields did not interfere, or interfered in a negligible way, with the power
and intensity of the entertainment she offered. We could wish for nothing
better. English literature has, of their own class, nothing better to offer
than certain chapters of <i>Adam Bede</i> or than the beginning of <i>The Mill
on the Floss</i>.</p>

<p>But, from the first, if we now examine coldly and inquisitively, there was
a moth sleeping in George Eliot's rich attire. This moth was pedantry, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
result doubtless of too much erudition encouraging a natural tendency in
her mind, which as we have seen was acquisitive rather than inventive.
It was unfortunate for her genius that after her early enthusiasm for French
culture she turned to Germany and became, in measure, like so many powerful
minds of her generation, Teutonised. This fostered the very tendencies
which it was desirable to eradicate. One can but speculate what would
have been the result on her genius of a little more Paris and a little less
Berlin. Her most successful immediate rival in France was Octave
Feuillet; the <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i> answer in time to <i>Le Roman d'un
Jeune Homme Pauvre</i>, and <i>Monsieur de Camors</i> to <i>Felix Holt</i>. There
could not be a stronger or more instructive contrast than between the
elegant fairy-land of the one and the robust realism of the other. But our
admirable pastoral writer, whose inward eye was stored with the harmonies
and humours of Shakespeare's country, was not content with her mastery
of the past. She looked forward to a literature of the future. She trusted to
her brain rather than to those tired servants, her senses, and more and
more her soul was invaded by the ambition to invent a new thing, the
scientific novel, dealing with the growth of institutions and the analysis
of individual character.</p>

<p>The critics of her own time were satisfied that she had done this, and
that she had founded the psychological novel. There was much to be said
in favour of such an opinion. In the later books it is an undeniable fact
that George Eliot displays a certain sense of the inevitable progress of life
which was new. It may seem paradoxical to see the peculiar characteristics
of Zola or of Mr. George Moore in <i>Middlemarch</i>, but there is much
to be said for the view that George Eliot was the direct forerunner of those
naturalistic novelists. Like them, she sees life as an organism, or even as
a progress. George Eliot in her contemplation of the human beings she
invents is a traveller, who is provided with a map. No Norman church or
ivied ruin takes her by surprise, because she has seen that it was bound to
come, and recognises it when it does come. Death, the final railway station,
is ever in her mind; she sees it on her map, and gathers her property around
her to be ready when the train shall stop. This psychological clairvoyance
gives her a great power when she does not abuse it, but unfortunately from
the very first there was in her a tendency, partly consequent on her mental
training, but also not a little on her natural constitution, to dwell in a hard
and pedagogic manner on it. She was not content to please, she must
explain and teach as well.</p>

<p>Her comparative failure to please made its definite appearance first in
the laboured and overcharged romance of <i>Romola</i>. But a careful reader
will detect it in her earliest writings. Quite early in <i>Amos Barton</i>, for
instance, when Mrs. Hackit observes of the local colliers that they "passed
their time in doing nothing but swilling ale and smoking, like the beasts
that perish," the author immediately spoils this delightful remark by
explaining, like a schoolmaster, that Mrs. Hackit was "speaking, we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
presume, in a remotely analogical sense." The laughter dies upon our lips.
Useless pedantry of this kind spoils many a happy touch of humour, Mrs.
Poyser alone perhaps having wholly escaped from it. It would be entirely
unjust to accuse George Eliot, at all events until near the end of her life,
of intellectual pride. She was, on the contrary, of a very humble spirit,
timorous and susceptible of discouragement. But her humility made her
work all the harder at her task of subtle philosophical analysis. It would
have been far better for her if she had possessed less of the tenacity of
Herbert Spencer and more of the recklessness of George Sand. An amusing
but painful example of her Sisyphus temper, always rolling the stone uphill
with groans and sweat, is to be found in her own account of the way
she "crammed up" for the composition of <i>Romola</i>. She tells us of the
wasting toil with which she worked up innumerable facts about Florence,
and in particular how she laboured long over the terrible question whether
Easter could have been "retarded" in the year 1492. On this, Sir Leslie
Stephen&mdash;one of her best critics, and one of the most indulgent&mdash;aptly
queries, "What would have become of <i>Ivanhoe</i> if Scott had bothered
himself about the possible retardation of Easter? The answer, indeed, is
obvious, that <i>Ivanhoe</i> would not have been written."</p>

<p>The effect of all this on George Eliot's achievement was what must
always occur when an intellect which is purely acquisitive and distributive
insists on doing work that is appropriate only to imagination. If we read
very carefully the scene preceding Savanarola's sermon to the Dominicans
at San Marco, we perceive that it is built up almost in Flaubert's manner,
but without Flaubert's magic, touch by touch, out of books. The author
does not see what she describes in a sort of luminous hallucination, but
she dresses up in language of her own what she has carefully read in Burlamacchi
or in Villari. The most conscientious labour, expended by the
most powerful brain, is incapable of producing an illusion of life by these
means. George Eliot may even possibly have been conscious of this, for
she speaks again and again, not of writing with ecstasy of tears and laughter,
as Dickens did, but of falling into "a state of so much wretchedness in
attempting to concentrate my thoughts on the construction of my novel"
that nothing but a tremendous and sustained effort of the will carried her
on at all. In this vain and terrible wrestling with incongruous elements
she wore out her strength and her joy, and it is heart-rending to watch so
noble a genius and so lofty a character as hers wasted in the whirlpool.
One fears that a sense of obscure failure added to her tortures, and one is
tempted to see a touch of autobiography in the melancholy of Mrs. Transome
(in <i>Felix Holt</i>), of whom we are told that "her knowledge and accomplishments
had become as valueless as old-fashioned stucco ornaments,
of which the substance was never worth anything, while the form is no
longer to the taste of any living mortal."</p>

<p>The notion that George Eliot was herself, in spite of all the laudation
showered upon her, consciously in want of some element essential for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
success is supported by the very curious fact that from 1864 to 1869, that
is to say through nearly one quarter of her whole literary career, she devoted
herself entirely to various experiments in verse. She was so preternaturally
intelligent that there is nothing unlikely in the supposition that she realised
what was her chief want as a writer of imaginative prose. She claims, and
she will always be justified in claiming, a place in the splendid roll of prominent
English writers. But she holds it in spite of a certain drawback which
forbids her from ever appearing in the front rank as a great writer. Her
prose has fine qualities of force and wit, it is pictorial and persuasive, but
it misses one prime but rather subtle merit, it never sings. The masters of
the finest English are those who have received the admonition <i>Cantate
Domino!</i> They sing a new song unto the Lord. Among George Eliot's prose
contemporaries there were several who obeyed this command. Ruskin, for
instance, above all the Victorian prose-writers, shouts like the morning-star.
It is the peculiar gift of all great prosaists. Take so rough an executant
as Hazlitt: "Harmer Hill stooped with all its pines, to listen to a poet, as
he passed!" That is the chanting faculty in prose, which all the greatest
men possess; but George Eliot has no trace of it, except sometimes, faintly,
in the sheer fun of her peasants' conversation. I do not question that she
felt the lack herself, and that it was this which, subconsciously, led her to
make a profound study of the art of verse.</p>

<p>She hoped, at the age of forty-four, to hammer herself into poetry by
dint of sheer labour and will-power. She read the great masters, and she
analysed them in the light of prosodical manuals. In 1871 she told Tennyson
that Professor Sylvester's "laws for verse-making had been useful to her."
Tennyson replied, "I can't understand that," and no wonder. Sylvester
was a facetious mathematician who undertook to teach the art of poetry
in so many lessons. George Eliot humbly working away at Sylvester, and
telling Tennyson that she was finding him "useful," and Tennyson, whose
melodies pursued him, like bees in pursuit of a bee-master, expressing a
gruff good-natured scepticism&mdash;what a picture it raises! But George Eliot
persisted, with that astounding firmness of application which she had, and
she produced quite a large body of various verse. She wrote a Comtist
tragedy, <i>The Spanish Gypsy</i>, of which I must speak softly, since, omnivorous
as I am, I have never been able to swallow it. But she wrote many
other things, epics and sonnets and dialogues and the rest of them, which
are not so hard to read. She actually printed privately for her friends
two little garlands, <i>Agatha</i> (1868) and <i>Brother and Sister</i> (1869), which
are the only "rare issues" of hers sought after by collectors, for she was
not given to bibliographical curiosity. These verses and many others she
polished and re-wrote with untiring assiduity, and in 1874 she published
a substantial volume of them. I have been reading them over again, in the
intense wish to be pleased with them, but it is impossible&mdash;the root of the
matter is not in them. There is an <i>Arion</i>, which is stately in the manner
of Marvell. The end of this lyric is tense and decisive, but there is the radical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
absence of song. In the long piece called <i>A College Breakfast Party</i>, which
she wrote in 1874, almost all Tennyson's faults are reconstructed on the plan
of the Chinese tailor who carefully imitates the rents in the English coat he is
to copy. There is a Goethe-like poem, of a gnomic order, called <i>Self and Life</i>,
stuffed with valuable thoughts as a turkey is stuffed with chestnuts.</p>

<p>And it is all so earnest and so intellectual, and it does so much credit to
Sylvester. After long consideration, I have come to the conclusion that
the following sonnet, from <i>Brother and Sister</i>, is the best piece of sustained
poetry that George Eliot achieved. It deals with the pathetic and
beautiful relations which existed between her and her elder brother Isaac,
the Tom Tulliver of <i>The Mill on the Floss</i>:</p>

<p class="in0">How near this is to true poetry, and yet how many miles away!</p>

<p>At last George Eliot seems to have felt that she could never hope, with
all her intellect, to catch the unconsidered music which God lavishes on
the idle linnet and the frivolous chaffinch. She returned to her own strenuous
business of building up the psychological novel. She wrote <i>Middlemarch</i>,
which appeared periodically throughout 1872 and as a book early the
following year. It was received with great enthusiasm, as marking the
return of a popular favourite who had been absent for several years. <i>Middlemarch</i>
is the history of three parallel lives of women, who "with dim
lights and tangled circumstances tried to shape their thought and deed in
noble agreement," although "to common eyes their struggles seemed mere
inconsistency and formlessness." The three ineffectual St. Theresas, as
their creator conceived them, were Dorothea, Rosamond, and Mary, and
they "shaped the thought and deed" of Casaubon and Ladislaw and
Fred Vincy. <i>Middlemarch</i> is constructed with unfaltering power, and the
picture of commonplace English country life which it gives is vivacious
after a mechanical fashion, but all the charm of the early stories has evaporated,
and has left behind it merely a residuum of unimaginative satire.
The novel is a very remarkable instance of elaborate mental resources
misapplied, and genius revolving, with tremendous machinery, like some
great water-wheel, while no water is flowing underneath it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
When a realist loses hold on reality all is lost, and I for one can find
not a word to say in favour of <i>Daniel Deronda</i>, her next and last novel,
which came out, with popularity at first more wonderful than ever, in 1876.
But her inner circle of admirers was beginning to ask one another uneasily
whether her method was not now too calculated, her effects too plainly
premeditated. The intensity of her early works was gone. Readers began
to resent her pedantry, her elaboration of allusions, her loss of simplicity.
They missed the vivid rural scenes and the flashes of delicious humour
which had starred the serious pages of <i>Adam Bede</i> and <i>The Mill</i> like
the lemon-yellow pansies and potentillas on a dark Welsh moor. Then
came <i>Theophrastus Such</i>, a collection of cumbrous and didactic essays
which defy perusal; and finally, soon after her death, her <i>Correspondence</i>,
a terrible disappointment to all her admirers, and a blow from which
even the worship of Lord Acton never recovered. Of George Eliot might
have been repeated Swift's epitaph on Sir John Vanbrugh:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lie heavy on him, earth, for he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid many a heavy load on thee.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It was the fatal error of George Eliot, so admirable, so elevated, so disinterested,
that for the last ten years of her brief literary life she did practically
nothing but lay heavy loads on literature.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, it is not possible to regard the place which George
Eliot holds in English literature as so prominent a one as was rather rashly
awarded her by her infatuated contemporaries. It is the inevitable result of
"tall talk" about Dante and Goethe that the figure so unduly magnified
fails to support such comparisons when the perspective is lengthened.
George Eliot is unduly neglected now, but it is the revenge of time on her
for the praise expended upon her works in her life-time. Another matter which
militates against her fame to-day is her strenuous solemnity. One of the
philosophers who knelt at the footsteps of her throne said that she was
"the emblem of a generation distracted between the intense need of believing
and the difficulty of belief." Well, we happen to live, fortunately or unfortunately
for ourselves, in a generation which is "distracted" by quite other
problems, and we are sheep that look up to George Eliot and are not fed
by her ponderous moral aphorisms and didactic ethical influence. Perhaps
another generation will follow us which will be more patient, and students
yet unborn will read her gladly. Let us never forget, however, that she
worked with all her heart in a spirit of perfect honesty, that she brought
a vast intelligence to the service of literature, and that she aimed from first
to last at the loftiest goal of intellectual ambition. Where she failed, it was
principally from an inborn lack of charm, not from anything ignoble or
impure in her mental disposition. After all, to have added to the slender
body of English fiction seven novels the names of which are known to every
cultivated person is not to have failed, but to have signally, if only relatively,
succeeded.</p>

<h2>THE FUTURE POET AND OUR TIME</h2>

<p class="center">By J. C. SQUIRE</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">HERE</span> is our world in motion.</p>

<p>We see a corner of it through our eyes. A man will march down
a street with a crowd, or watch the politicians' cabs turning into
Palace Yard, or make speeches, or stand on the deck of a scurrying
destroyer in the North Sea, or mount guard in a Mesopotamian desert.
A minute section of the greater panorama passes before him.</p>

<p>In imagination he will, according to his information and his habit of
mind, visualise what he sees as a part of what he does not see: the human
conflict over five continents, climates and clothes, multitudes, passions,
voices, states, soldiers, negotiations. Each newspaper that he opens swarms
with a confusion of events and argument, of names familiar and unfamiliar&mdash;Wilson,
Geddes, Czecho-Slovakia, Yudenitch, Shantung, and ten thousand
more. For the eye there is a medley, for the ear a great din. As far as he
can, busy with his daily pursuits, a man usually ignores it when it does not
intrude to disturb him. When most unsettled, the life of the world is most
fatiguing. The spectacle is formless and without a centre; the characters
rise and fall, conspicuous one day, forgotten the next. The newspapers
mechanically repeat that we are at the greatest crisis of history, and that
"a great drama is being unrolled." We are aware that the fortunes of our
civilisation have been and are in the balance. But we are in the wood and
cannot see it as we see the French Revolution. It is difficult, even with
the strongest effort of imagination, to visualise the process as history will
record it. To pick out those episodes and those persons that will haunt the
imagination of posterity by their colour and force is more difficult still.
An event, contemporaneously, is an event; a man is a man who eats, drinks,
wears collars, makes speeches, bandies words with others, and is photographed
for the newspapers.</p>

<p>Yet we know that a time will come when these years will be seen in far
retrospect as the years of Elizabeth or of Robespierre are now. The judgments
of the political scientist and the historian will be made: these men will
arrange their sequences and their scales of importance. They will deduce
effects and measure out praise and blame. With them we are not concerned.
But others beyond them will look at our time. We shall have left our legacy
for the imagination. What will it be? Who of contemporary figures may we
guess as likely to be the heroes of plays and the subjects of poems? Which
of the multitudinous events of these years will give a stock subject to
Tragedy? Which of the men whom we praise or abuse will seem to posterity
larger than human, and go with gestures across their stages, clad in an
antique fashion? For to that age we shall be strange; whether our mechanical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
arts have died and left us to haunt the memory of our posterity as a race
of unquiet demons, or whether "progress" along our lines shall have
continued, none of our trappings will have remained the same.</p>

<p>But the soul of man will have remained the same. Those elements in
events and persons which fascinate and stimulate us when we are looking
at our past will stir them when they brood on their past, which is our to-day.
And neither contemporary reputation, nor worldly position, nor conquests
in themselves, nor saintliness in itself, can secure for a man a continued
life in the imagination of the race.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Contemplate our own past in the light of this conception. Who are the
men of whom poets and playwrights and story-tellers have made fictions
and songs? Augustus Cæsar when he lived was the greatest man in the
world: but who since Virgil has panegyrised him and who&mdash;unless some
ingenious psychologist of the second-rate like Browning&mdash;would make a
dramatic poem out of him? William Wilberforce was a very good man, but
his deeds and his name have survived his personality, and he will not be
the hero of an epic. The Thirty Years' War was a long and very devastating
war; Gustavus and Wallenstein, in their degree, survive the purposeless
series of its disasters; and of all its events that which most vividly lives
in the memory is the small thing with which it began: the flinging of two
noblemen from a tower. What is it in things and men that gives them
permanently the power of stirring the imagination and the curiosity of the
artist? A quality of splendour and of power that grows more certain when
the dust that was its receptacle has gone to dust. The artist who shall succeed
with a historical personage may make whatever implicit or even explicit
commentary he likes, but in choosing his subject&mdash;or being chosen by it&mdash;moral
judgment or scientific estimate will not influence him. He will be
the victim of an attraction beyond the will and beyond the reason. Consider
who are the figures that truly, imperatively, live in the political story of the
past. Not only and not all the Cæsars who fought over the known world;
not only such chivalric souls as saw, and obeyed, the visions of Domrémy,
and died when the echoes of the last horn faded over Roncesvalles. The
Crusades, as a whole, were a great poem, but few of the Crusaders won
more than an ephemeral name in art. Cœur de Lion has been in our own
time the hero of a romance, but no man is likely again to write of even a
Godfrey of Boulogne. The great age of historic Greece passed and left
imperishable monuments, "one nation making worth a nation's pain,"
but how few of her soldiers and philosophers recur to the creative imagination!
Those stories and figures from history and pre-history which do so
recur are a strangely assorted collection. The Trojan War and its leading
personages are a fascination and an inspiration perennially, and among
those personages Helen, Hector, Achilles, Ulysses; but not Paris or the sons
of Atreus, who live but as appendages. Coldly arguing, men may ask now as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
they asked then, why the Greeks should take so much trouble to recover a
worthless woman, why a Hector should die to keep her, why ten thousand
should perish in such a cause. But to the imagination Hector, Achilles,
Helen, the divine unreason of that ten years' war, make an appeal that never
comes from worthier struggles and wiser people. That is true also of Antony
and Cleopatra: their story to the historian and the moralist is one of ruinous
folly, to the poet a</p>

<p>The figure of St. Francis has been created and recreated in art; like those

we can do what we will; Lear and Hamlet Shakespeare could cast in the
sublimest mould; with the historical we are tied by the historical, and
few are great enough to come through the sieve. Poets have attempted
and failed to make great characters of Becket, of Wolsey, of Strafford, and
Charles I.; their degree of failure has varied, but they have failed as certainly
as Keats would have failed with King Stephen. The material was not there.
Cromwell and Frederick the Great at least equalled Philip II. in achievement,
and excelled him in intelligence. But Carlyle's two heroes were no true
heroes for an artist; we are too uncertain about Cromwell's inner man, his
direction; for all his battles he could cast no colour over his surroundings;
and as for Frederick there was no tragedy about him&mdash;that was left for
his neighbours. A great Cromwell, in one sense, would be an invented
Cromwell; and we cannot invent a Cromwell because of the documents.
But Philip II., the intense, narrow, laborious, dyspeptic bigot, sitting in a
cell of his great bleak prison on the plateau, trying to watch every corner of
the world, and contriving how to scourge most of it; he was contemptible,
full of vices, a failure, but there was that in him which has compelled the
gaze of poets in seclusion from the seventeenth century down to Verhaeren
and Verlaine. He had a virtue in excess. There was a touch of sublimity
about him. The setting counts for much; monarchs are on pinnacles. But
where is Philip IV., except for his horse-face on the canvases of Velasquez?
Where even, as against the man he beat, is William the Silent, who waged
a great fight against odds and died by the dagger; but was a cool Whig,
excessive in nothing but self-control? He is scarcely alive; but Satan, as
Milton saw him, reigns in hell. We must have splendour of a sort. The
normal man loves a conflagration, though he will lend a hand in putting
it out; and if he is putting it out the inmost heart of him will rejoice if it be
a large fire and there are very few firemen. Vivid force, moral or non-moral,
must be there; a Borgia, though he be as wicked as a Nero, cannot compete
with him before the imagination; he was commonplace and sordid and
there is no response to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
Such passages and such people kindle us in the records of the past.
How, from this point of view, will the last five years, crowded and full of
strife, look when we are the materials for art?</p>

<p>Will the decline of Turkey command interest? To the historian, not to
the poet, so not, ultimately, to the generality of mankind. There is no emergence
there of the human spirit at an exalted pitch; very new and surprising
things must come out about Enver if he is to rank with the great adventurers
of the stage. Men may try it&mdash;they have tried most things&mdash;but Constantinople
has failed the artist before and will again. There is something pathetic,
there might be something tragic, in the collapse of the House of Hapsburg
after so many centuries, but so far as we know at present (and our statements
are avowedly conjectures) there was no incident of that fall, compassed
and witnessed by small intriguing men, which can redeem it from
squalor and insignificance; and not all our reiterated assurances that this
is a tremendous and tragic catastrophe can invest it with the high romantic
quality which comes from passion in many men or in one man, strength
and a heroic struggle. The League of Nations may be the salvation of
mankind, but it has come in such a way, so slowly, so reluctantly, so
haphazardly, so sensibly, that (unless comedy) nothing vital will be written
of its birth. Can we see a subject for a Shakespeare or a Milton in the
domestic struggle here, or the fluctuations of the Balkans, or the entry
of the East into the war? These things made their differences, but will
they to the artist be more than facts? And the men. There have arisen from
the populations of all countries men, many of them "great" by virtue of
position, influence, achievement; many of them disinterested and ethically
admirable. The mind passes from one to another; over some it flits, over
others it hesitates and hovers. There is something of the sublime about
M. Clemenceau, the old fighter, symbolising France at the last barrier: a
man who, in early novels now forgotten, formulated, or refused to formulate,
a philosophy of despair, and depicted a universe without principle, order,
or hope, in which the stronger beast, to no end, preyed on the weaker; a
man, nevertheless, so full of vital energy, and so certain of the one thing
he loved, that he desired nothing better than to continue furiously struggling
under the impending cope of darkness. There are, to some of us, disagreeable
things about him; stripped of the non-essential there is something central,
that is, elemental and fine. But were he of the kind that becomes legendary,
should we feel that central something as still uncertain, and would it have
needed a war at the age of nearly eighty to have revealed something of
grandeur in him? Is he, at bottom, clear and forcible enough; or, alternatively,
does he feel with sufficient strength, does he want anything, plan
or place or spectacle, with sufficient passion? We cannot be certain: he
may be forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
Something of doubt colours also one's view of America's entry and the
career of President Wilson, in some regards a close analogue to that of
Lincoln. The lines of that story are simple&mdash;the watching pose, the gradual
approximation to war, the President's mental struggle, his decision to throw
America's weight into the scale, his manifestos to the world in the names
of liberty, honesty, and kindness, his determination that the war, if possible,
should be the last. But the man at the centre of this tremendous revolution
of events, the mouthpiece of these great sentiments, has he that last
abandonment of feeling which alone captivates the imagination of those
who hold the mirror up to certain aspects of Nature? Without denying
that it may be a great blessing that he lacks that force, without presuming
to know all about him that may later be revealed, I feel doubtful. Death,
more particularly violent death, before the end, might have enabled artists
to impute to him something that perhaps was not there, to give him the
benefit of the doubt. But very likely for our good, possibly with the
greatest wisdom, he compromised at Paris. A more spontaneous man
might have ruined us all; but if compromise is excellent in politics, it is
of small use to poets. I doubt if the President will take his place with St.
Francis, Philip II., and Nero.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>There will survive from the war, and from the other events of our day,
certain episodes which will, as by accident, draw the notice of artists and
be, as we speak, immortalised. A few of the countless heroic and self-sacrificing
actions which men have performed in every country and by
every sea will be snatched from oblivion. Tragedians, in all probability, will
brood on the story of Miss Cavell. The names of a subaltern and an
airman, fortuitously selected, will live as live those of Hervé Riel and
Pheidipiddes. But this is not what we call history. I think that the Rupert
Brooke legend will develop. He was beautiful and a poet, and he died in
arms, young. He had wandered to the islands of the Pacific, and his comrades
buried him in an island of the Ægean. About him they will write poems,
plays even, in which, their colour given by actions and sayings which are
recorded, he will pass through experiences which were never his, and
thoughts will be imputed to him which possibly he never had. Two older
artists have taken a more prominent part in the war and its politics, a part
that may indisputably be called political. Of Paderewski I know nothing,
except that a man's progress could not easily have a setting more superficially
romantic; the strength of the man may be guessed at by stray tokens.
A person of whom fame in art may more certainly be predicted is d'Annunzio,
a man not in every way admirable, but of a demoniacal courage, who has
crowned a career full of flamboyant passages with actions that, as a spectacle,
are magnificent: orations pulsating with ardour for the glory and power of
the Latin genius, words that were pregnant of acts, and following these,
after years of reckless flying, the sudden theatrical stroke at Fiume. As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
"character" he justified himself by that lawless blow; his rhetoric finally
proved itself the rhetoric of real passion, a lust for violent life, self-assertion
at the risk of death, the flaunting of the Italian name; and, felt as such, it
has moved a whole army and a whole people. Whatever the results of
analysis applied to his character or the ultimate outcome of his splendid
panache, he cannot but become, to the artists of one nation at least, a hero,
the material for romance.</p>

<p>There may be others. But, projecting myself as well as I am able, I
cannot see on the larger stage, amid the great fortunes of peoples and their
rulers, more than two subjects on which I think we may be positive that
they will pass into the company of material to which artists return and return,
subjects which already outline themselves with some clarity to the imagination
and have the air of greatness.</p>

<p>One is the fall of the German Empire. Were it shortly to be restored, the
force with which its calamities will appeal to us would be diminished: for an
end must be an end. But if what seemed to happen really has happened
there is a spectacle there which will appear more prodigious and more
moving as time goes on&mdash;that triply-armed vainglorious kingdom pulling
the world down on itself; the long, desperate, ruthless fight against enemies
ultimately superior; the "siege"; the quality, proud and assured if barbaric,
of the Prussian spirit which filled the ruling caste and determined at once
its fight and its fall. The tale is tragic, and almost epic; the persons are not
yet revealed who shall be capable of being made, on the stage or in books,
the instruments for telling it. Certainly, though men, misguidedly, will
attempt to make Wilhelm II. sustain an artistic load to which he is not
equal, the Kaiser will make no great hero or hero-villain. Possibly in some
Hindenburg or other general will be found the strength, the simplicity of
belief or resolve, which make a great figure; or possibly this will be of the
tragedies in which the individual humans are all pigmies subordinate to the
main theme. Elsewhere, I think, is to be found a man who has about him
the certain atmosphere of imaginative life. He is Vladimir Ulianoff, Lenin.</p>

<p>I talked a few weeks ago with a Russian in exile, a Conservative, an
official of the old regime, and (I think) a Baltic Baron. He was not, therefore,
sympathetic to the Bolsheviks or to Lenin; he hated, though he understood,
them and he loathed him. "Lenin has ruined Russia," he said, taking no
pains to conceal his desire that Lenin should die. Then the imaginative
man in him awoke, as it has a way of doing in intelligent Russians of all
kinds, and he suddenly added vehemently: "But a hundred years hence a
Hero of Legend, like Peter the Great and the Prince who first introduced
Christianity into Russia."</p>

<p>I felt immediately that he had spoken not merely a truth, but an obvious
one. Englishmen may have all sorts of opinions about Lenin; few have
heard much beyond rumour of him, but even those who are most avowedly
ignorant of him or most leniently inclined to him would scarcely like to
find him in their midst. Yet there is that flavour of vitality, of greatness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
about him that is lacking in many who have caused misery to none and even
in some of the most potent benefactors of mankind. We feel it almost
unconsciously; the recognition of it is, as it were, instinctive; a picture of
him, growing from stray scraps of news and rumour, has been forming in
our minds, a picture almost from the first differentiated from that, say, of
his equally active colleague, Trotsky. Trotsky, one feels, might disappear
to-morrow and leave but a name and some wreckage. But the other man,
if he be not in the line of Tolstoi (as some of his adherents seem to suppose
him to be), is in the line of the great oriental despots, of Tamerlane and
Genghiz Khan.</p>

<p>And we shall know more of him, far more, than we shall ever know of
Tamerlane and Genghiz Khan: as much very likely as we know of Napoleon.
He has no physical attributes and no material accoutrements which might
lend him adventitious aid as the centre of a pageant of power, struggle, or
woe: a short, bowed man in a black coat, vivacious, hedged by no formalities
of ceremonial. Yet to the imagination&mdash;and it must surely be so when he is
seen backward&mdash;this little fanatic, who for twenty years was hunted from
exile to exile, and returned to overthrow a government and enthrone himself
on the ruins of a great Empire, is the centre of Russia, seated in the middle
of that enormous web of conflict and suffering like an impassive and implacable
spider. We hear this and that of him. He is genial in conversation.
He is not personally cruel. He is willing to slaughter thousands at a
blow to realise his ideas, for he looks at human affairs historically, if
with but one eye. He is a poor speaker, but his words whip audiences into
enthusiasm. He thought he would be overturned in three weeks, but adapted
himself with instant decision when a longer lease was offered. This man
and that is jealous of him and has tried to upset him; he has said this or that
about his success and his failure; he will fly; or he knows he will be executed.
The reports contradict each other, but the picture remains and strengthens,
the picture of a man in the grip of an idea, with one of the strongest wills
in the world, indifferent to the pains and pleasures of ordinary people.
That ugly little face, with its swollen bald forehead, its slanting lids closing
on straight penetrating eyes, its squat nose, its fleshy mouth between
moustache and goatee, its smile mechanical as a mask's, will be more familiar
to our descendants than to us. They will see in reverie the revolution,
with vast ancient Russia as its background, and this doctrinaire tyrant as
its centre, with his ragged armies, his spies and Chinamen, his motley
gang of clever Jews, brigands, and mild, bearded, spectacled professors
around him. They will feel his magnetism, and, whether as "hero of legend"
or devil of legend, they will celebrate him.</p>

<p>Of these things perhaps men will write two hundred or two thousand
years hence. But the duration of human life on our planet is measured, as
we suppose, in tens of thousands of years.</p>

<p>We go to the grave. The sunlight comes into this room; it shines on the
table and the books and the papers. I listen to the twittering of the birds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
shorter lived than ourselves, and the intermittent rushing of the wind,
which, while life lasts, goes on always the same. A car moans past; its noise
begins, swells, and dies away. The trees wave about; a horse's feet plod by;
the sunlight sparkles on the river and glorifies the mud. Clouds come over.
The sun, unseen, sets; the evening grows bluer and lamps twinkle out over
the misty river. So, noiselessly, proceeds time, and the earth revolves and
revolves through its alternations of sun and shade. These airs, these lights
and sounds, will be the same; but we, alive and immortal as we feel, shall
have gone and the clamour that we made will recede. To an epoch we shall
be the coloured strutters of history and of legend; to a later age, however
remote and whatever the accumulation of our records, we must become
august shadows like the dim kings and fabulous empires that passed before
Babylon and Egypt. "Truly ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with
you." The sentence was written more than two thousand years ago; the
author is unknown and receding. Yet, obliterated in the end though all
remembrance of us may be, we shall not even on this earth die with our
bodies, and for some interval, not to be computed, certain actions at this
moment in progress will endure in a sublimated state, and certain men
with whom we may even have spoken will enlarge to a more than human
stature and communicate, as they could never do in life, their essence
to the enduring tradition of men. Are they those whom we have mentioned;
or are they, as they may be, others who to us are insignificant and obscured?</p>

<h2 title="Horace Walpole">HORACE <span class="locked">WALPOLE<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></h2>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> <i>Letters of Horace Walpole; Oxford University Press, 16 vols., 96s. Supplementary
Letters, 1919; Oxford University Press, 2 vols., 17s.</i></p></div>

<p class="center b1">By ROBERT LYND</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">HORACE</span> Walpole was a dainty rogue in porcelain who walked
badly. In his best days, as he records in one of his letters, it was
said of him that he "tripped like a pewit." "If I do not flatter
myself," he wrote when he was just under sixty, "my march
at present is more like a dabchick's." A lady has left a description of him
entering a room, "knees bent, and feet on tiptoe as if afraid of a wet floor."
When his feet were not swollen with the gout, they were so slender, he said,
that he "could dance a minuet on a silver penny." He was ridiculously
lean, and his hands were crooked with his unmerited disease. An invalid,
a caricature of the birds, and not particularly well dressed in spite of his
lavender suit and partridge silk stockings, he has nevertheless contrived to
leave in his letters an impression of almost perfect grace and dandyism.
He had all the airs of a beau. He affected coolness, disdain, amateurishness,
triviality. He was a china figure of insolence. He lived on the mantelpiece,
and regarded everything that happened on the floor as a rather low joke
that could not be helped. He warmed into humanity in his friendships
and in his defence of the house of Walpole; but if he descended from his
mantelpiece, it was more likely to be in order to feed a squirrel than to
save an Empire. His most common image of the world was a puppet-show.
He saw kings, prime ministers, and men of genius alike about the
size of dolls. When George II. died, he wrote a brief note to Thomas Brand:
"Dear Brand&mdash;You love laughing; there is a king dead; can you help
coming to town?" That represents his measure of things. Those who love
laughing will laugh all the more when they discover that, a week earlier,
Walpole had written a letter, rotund, fulsome, and in the language of the
bended knee, begging Lord Bute to be allowed to kiss the Prince of Wales's
hand. His attitude to the Court he described to George Montagu as
"mixing extreme politeness with extreme indifference." His politeness,
like his indifference, was but play at the expense of a solemn world.
"I wrote to Lord Bute," he informed Montagu; "thrust in all the <i>unexpecteds,
want of ambition, disinterestedness, etc.</i>, that I could amass, gilded
with as much duty, affection, zeal, etc., as possible." He frankly professed
relief that he had not after all to go to Court and act out the extravagant
compliments he had written. "Was ever so agreeable a man as King George
the Second," he wrote, "to die the very day it was necessary to save me
from ridicule?" "For my part," he adds later in the same spirit, "my
man Harry will always be a favourite; he tells me all the amusing news;
he first told me of the late Prince of Wales's death, and to-day of the King's."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
It is not that Walpole was a republican of the school of Plutarch. He
was merely a toy republican who enjoyed being insolent at the expense of
kings, and behind their backs. He was scarcely capable of open rudeness
in the fashion of Beau Brummell's "Who's your fat friend?" His ridicule
was never a public display; it was a secret treasured for his friends. He was
the greatest private entertainer of the eighteenth century, and he ridiculed
the great, as people say, for the love of diversion. "I always write the
thoughts of the moment," he told the dearest of his friends, Conway,
"and even laugh to divert the person I am writing to, without any ill will
on the subjects I mention." His letters are for the most part those of a
good-natured man.</p>

<p>It is not that he was above the foible&mdash;it was barely more than that&mdash;of
hatred. He did not trouble greatly about enemies of his own, but he never
could forgive the enemies of Sir Robert Walpole. His ridicule of the Duke
of Newcastle goes far beyond diversion. It is the baiting of a mean and
treacherous animal, whose teeth were "tumbling out," and whose mouth
was "tumbling in." He rejoices in the exposure of the dribbling indignity
of the Duke, as when he describes him going to Court on becoming Prime
Minister in 1754:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>On Friday this august remnant of the Pelhams went to Court for the first time.
At the foot of the stairs he cried and sunk down; the yeomen of the guard were
forced to drag him up under the arms. When the closet-door opened, he flung
himself at his length at the King's feet, sobbed, and cried, "God bless your Majesty
God preserve your Majesty!" and lay there howling and embracing the King's
knees, with one foot so extended that my Lord Coventry, who was <i>luckily</i> in
waiting, and begged the standers-by to retire, with, "For God's sake, gentlemen,
don't look at a great man in distress!" endeavouring to shut the door, caught his
grace's foot, and made him roar with pain.</p></blockquote>

<p>The caricature of the Duke is equally merciless in the description of
George II.'s funeral in the Abbey, in which the "burlesque Duke" is
introduced as comic relief into the solemn picture:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He fell into a fit of crying the moment he came into the chapel, and flung himself
back in a stall, the Archbishop hovering over him with a smelling-bottle; but in two
minutes his curiosity got the better of his hypocrisy, and he ran about the chapel
with his glass to spy who was or was not there, spying with one hand and mopping
his eyes with the other. Then returned the fear of catching cold; and the Duke of
Cumberland, who was sinking with heat, felt himself weighed down, and turning
round found it was the Duke of Newcastle standing upon his train to avoid the chill
of the marble.</p></blockquote>

<p>Walpole, indeed, broke through his habit of public decorum in his
persecution of the Duke; and he tells how on one occasion at a ball at
Bedford House he and Brand and George Selwyn plagued the pitiful old
creature, who "wriggled, and shuffled, and lisped, and winked, and spied"
his way through the company, with a conversation at his expense carried
on in stage whispers. There was never a more loyal son than Horace Walpole.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
He offered up a Prime Minister daily as a sacrifice at Sir Robert's
tomb.</p>

<p>At the same time, his aversions were not always assumed as part of a
family inheritance. He had by temperament a small opinion of men and
women outside the circle of his affections. It was his first instinct to disparage.
He even described his great friend Madame du Deffand, at the first time of
meeting her, as "an old blind debauchée of wit." His comments on the
men of genius of his time are almost all written in a vein of satirical intolerance.
He spoke ill of Sterne and Dr. Johnson, of Fielding and Richardson,
of Boswell and Goldsmith. Goldsmith he found "silly"; he was "an idiot
with once or twice a fit of parts." Boswell's <i>Tour of the Hebrides</i> was "the
story of a mountebank and his zany." Walpole felt doubly justified in
disliking Johnson owing to the criticism of Gray in the <i>Lives of the Poets</i>.
He would not even, when Johnson died, subscribe to a monument. A
circular letter asking for a subscription was sent to him, signed by Burke,
Boswell, and Reynolds. "I would not deign to write an answer," Walpole
told the Miss Berrys, "but sent down word by my footman, as I would
have done to parish officers with a brief, that I would not subscribe."
Walpole does not appear in this incident the "sweet-tempered creature"
he had earlier claimed to be. His pose is that of a school-girl in a cutting
mood. At the same time his judgment of Johnson has an element of truth
in it. "Though he was good-natured at bottom," he said of him, "he was
very ill-natured at top." It has often been said of Walpole that, in his
attitude to contemporary men of genius, he was influenced mainly by their
position in society&mdash;that he regarded an author who was not a gentleman
as being necessarily an inferior author. This is hardly fair. The contemporary
of whom he thought most highly was Gray, the son of a money broker. He
did not spare Lady Mary Wortley Montagu any more than Richardson. If
he found an author offensive, it was more likely to be owing to a fastidious
distaste for low life than to an aristocratic distaste for low birth; and to him
Bohemianism was the lowest of low life. It was certainly Fielding's Bohemianism
that disgusted him. He relates how two of his friends called on
Fielding one evening and found him "banqueting with a blind man, a
woman, and three Irishmen, on some cold mutton and a bone of ham, both
in one dish, and the dirtiest cloth." Horace Walpole's daintiness recoiled
from the spirit of an author who did not know how to sup decently. If he
found Boswell's <i>Johnson</i> tedious, it was no doubt partly due to his inability
to reconcile himself to Johnson's table manners. It can hardly be denied
that he was unnaturally sensitive to surface impressions. He was a great
observer of manners, but not a great portrayer of character. He knew men
in their absurd actions rather than in their motives&mdash;even their absurd
motives. He never admits us into the springs of action in his portraits as
Saint-Simon does. He was too studied a believer in the puppetry of men
and women to make them more than ridiculous. And unquestionably the
vain race of authors lent itself admirably to his love of caricature. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
account of the vanity of Gibbon, whose history he admired this side
enthusiasm, shows how he delighted in playing with an egoistic author
as with a trout.</p>

<p>"So much," he concludes, "for literature and its fops." The comic spirit
leans to an under-estimate rather than an over-estimate of human nature,
and the airs the authors gave themselves were not only a breach of his code,
but an invitation to his contempt. "You know," he once wrote, "I shun
authors, and would never have been one myself if it obliged me to keep
such bad company. They are always in earnest and think their profession
serious, and will dwell upon trifles and reverence learning. I laugh at all
these things, and write only to laugh at them and divert myself. None of
us are authors of any consequence, and it is the most ridiculous of all
vanities to be vain of being <i>mediocre</i>." He followed the Chinese school of
manners and made light of his own writings. "What have I written," he
asks, "that was worth remembering, even by myself?" "It would be
affected," he tells Gray, "to say I am indifferent to fame. I certainly am not,
but I am indifferent to almost anything I have done to acquire it. The
greater part are mere compilations; and no wonder they are, as you say,
incorrect when they were commonly written with people in the room."</p>

<p>It is generally assumed that, in speaking lightly of himself, Walpole was
merely posturing. To me it seems that he was sincere enough. He had a
sense of greatness in literature, as is shown by his reverence of Shakespeare,
and he was too much of a realist not to see that his own writings at their
best were trifles beside the monuments of the poets. He felt that he was
doing little things in a little age. He was diffident both for his times and for
himself. So difficult do some writers find it to believe that there was any
deep genuineness in him that they ask us to regard even his enthusiasm
for great literature as a pretence. They do not realise that the secret of his
attraction for us is that he was an enthusiast disguised as an eighteenth-century
man of fashion. His airs and graces were not the result of languor,
but of his pleasure in wearing a mask. He was quick, responsive, excitable,
and only withdrew into the similitude of a china figure, as Diogenes into his
tub, through philosophy. The truth is, the only dandies who are tolerable
are those whose dandyism is a cloak of reserve. Our interest in character
is largely an interest in contradictions of this kind. The beau capable of
breaking into excitement awakens our curiosity, as does the conqueror stooping
to a humane action, the Puritan caught in the net of the senses, or the
pacifist in a rage of violence. The average man, whom one knows superficially,
is a formula, or seems to live the life of a formula. That is why we
find him dull. The characters who interest us in history and literature,
on the other hand, are perpetually giving the lie to the formulæ we invent,
and are bound to invent, for them. They give us pleasure not by confirming
us, but by surprising us. It seems to me absurd, then, to regard Walpole's
air of indifference as the only real thing about him and to question his
raptures. From his first travels among the Alps with Gray down to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
senile letters to Hannah More about the French Revolution, we see him
as a man almost hysterical in the intensity of his sensations, whether of joy
or of horror. He lived for his sensations like an æsthete. He wrote of himself
as "I, who am as constant at a fire as George Selwyn at an execution."
If he cared for the crownings of kings and such occasions, it was because
he took a childish delight in the fireworks and illuminations.</p>

<p>He had the keen spirit of a masquerader. Masquerades, he declared, were
"one of my ancient passions," and we find him as an elderly man dressing
out "a thousand young Conways and Cholmondeleys" for an entertainment
of the kind, and going "with more pleasure to see them pleased than when
I formerly delighted in that diversion myself." He was equally an enthusiast
in his hobbies and his tastes. He rejoiced to get back in May to Strawberry
Hill, "where my two passions, lilacs and nightingales, are in bloom." He
could not have made his collections or built his battlements in a mood of
indifference. In his love of mediæval ruins he showed himself a Goth-intoxicated
man. As for Strawberry Hill itself, the result may have been a
ridiculous mouse, but it took a mountain of enthusiasm to produce it.
Walpole's own description of his house and its surroundings has an exquisite
charm that almost makes one love the place as he did. "It is a little plaything
house," he told Conway, "that I got out of Mrs. Chenevix's shop, and is
the prettiest bauble you ever saw. It is set in enamelled meadows, with
filigree hedges:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A small Euphrates through the piece is roll'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little finches wave their wings in gold."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">He goes on to decorate the theme with comic and fanciful properties:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Two delightful roads that you would call dusty supply me continually with coaches
and chaises; barges as solemn as barons of the exchequer move under my window;
Richmond Hill and Ham-walks bound my prospect; but, thank God, the Thames is
between me and the Duchess of Queensberry. Dowagers as plenty as flounders
inhabit all around, and Pope's ghost is just now skimming under my window by a
most poetical moonlight. I have about land enough to keep such a farm as Noah's
when he set up in the Ark with a pair of each kind.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is in the spirit of a child throwing its whole imagination into playing
with a Noah's Ark that he describes his queer house. It is in this spirit that
he sees the fields around his house "speckled with cows, horses, and sheep."
The very phrase suggests toy animals. Walpole himself declared at the age
of seventy-three: "My best wisdom has consisted in forming a baby-house
full of playthings for my second childhood." That explains why one almost
loves the creature. Macaulay has severely censured him for devoting
himself to the collection of knick-knacks, such as King William III.'s spurs,
and it is apparently impossible to defend Walpole as a collector to be taken
seriously. Walpole, however, collected things in a mood of fantasy as much
as of connoisseurship. He did not take himself quite seriously. It was
fancy, not connoisseurship, that made him hang up Magna Charta beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
his bed and, opposite it, the Warrant for the execution of King Charles I.,
on which he had written "Major Charta." Who can question the fantastic
quality of the mind that wrote to Conway: "Remember, neither Lady
Salisbury nor you, nor Mrs. Damer, have seen my new divine closet, nor
the billiard-sticks with which the Countess of Pembroke and Arcadia used
to play with her brother, Sir Philip," and ended: "I never did see Cotchel,
and am sorry. Is not the old wardrobe there still? There was one from the
time of Cain, but Adam's breeches and Eve's under-petticoat were eaten
by a goat in the ark. Good night." He laughed over the knick-knacks he collected
for himself and his friends. "As to snuff-boxes and tooth-pick cases,"
he wrote to the Countess of Ossory from Paris in 1771, "the vintage has
entirely failed this year." Everything that he turned his mind to in Strawberry
Hill he regarded in the same spirit of comic delight. He stood outside
himself, like a spectator, and nothing gave him more pleasure than to figure
himself as a master of the ceremonies among the bantams, and the squirrels
and the goldfish. In one of his letters he describes himself and Bentley
fishing in the pond for goldfish with "nothing but a pail and a basin and a
tea-strainer, which I persuade my neighbours is the Chinese method."
This was in order to capture some of the fish for Bentley, who "carried a
dozen to town t'other day in a decanter."</p>

<p>Among the various creatures with which he loved to surround himself,
it is impossible to forget either the little black spaniel, Tony, that the wolf
carried off near a wood in the Alps during his first travels, or the more
imperious little dog, Tonton, which he has constantly to prevent from
biting people at Madame du Deffand's, but which with Madame du Deffand
herself "grows the greater favourite the more people he devours." "T'other
night," writes Walpole, to whom Madame du Deffand afterwards bequeathed
the dog in her will, "he flew at Lady Barrymore's face, and I
thought would have torn her eye out, but it ended in biting her finger. She
was terrified; she fell into tears. Madame du Deffand, who has too much
parts not to see everything in its true light, perceiving that she had not
beaten Tonton half enough, immediately told us a story of a lady whose
dog having bitten a piece out of a gentleman's leg, the tender dame, in a
great fright, cried out, 'Won't it make him sick?'" In the most attractive
accounts we possess of Walpole in his old age, we see him seated at the
breakfast-table, drinking tea out of "most rare and precious ancient porcelain
of Japan," and sharing the loaf and butter with Tonton (now grown almost
too fat to move, and spread on a sofa beside him), and afterwards going
to the window with a basin of bread and milk to throw to the squirrels in
the garden.</p>

<p>Many people would be willing to admit, however, that Walpole was an
excitable creature where small things were concerned&mdash;a parroquet or the
prospect of being able to print original letters of Ninon de l'Enclos at Strawberry,
or the discovery of a poem by the brother of Anne Boleyn, or Ranelagh,
where "the floor is all of beaten princes." What is not generally realised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
is that he was also a high-strung and eager spectator of the greater things.
I have already spoken of his enthusiasm for wild nature as shown in his
letters from the Alps. It is true he grew weary of them. "Such uncouth
rocks," he wrote, "and such uncomely inhabitants." "I am as surfeited
with mountains and inns as if I had eat them," he groaned in a later letter.
But the enthusiasm was at least as genuine as the fatigue. His tergiversation
of mood proves only that there were two Walpoles, not that the Walpole
of the romantic enthusiasms was insincere. He was a devotee of romance,
but it was romance under the control of the comic spirit. He was always
amused to have romance brought down to reality, as when, writing of
Mary Queen of Scots, he said: "I believe I have told you that, in a very
old trial of her, which I bought for Lord Oxford's collection, it is said that
she was a large lame woman. Take sentiments out of their <i>pantoufles</i>, and
reduce them to the infirmities of mortality, what a falling off there is!"
But see him in the picture-gallery in his father's old house at Houghton,
after an absence of sixteen years, and the romantic mood is uppermost.
"In one respect," he writes, speaking of the pictures, "I am very young; I
cannot satiate myself with looking," and he adds, "Not a picture here
but calls a history; not one but I remember in Downing Street or Chelsea,
where queens and crowds admired them." And, if he could not "satiate himself
with looking" at the Italian and Flemish masters, he similarly preserved
the heat of youth in his enthusiasm for Shakespeare. "When," he wrote,
during his dispute with Voltaire on the point, "I think over all the great
authors of the Greeks, Romans, Italians, French, and English (and I know
no other languages), I set Shakespeare first and alone and then begin anew."</p>

<p>Not that it is possible to represent him as a man with anything Dionysiac
in his temperament. The furthest that one can go is to say that he was a
man of sincere strong sentiment with quivering nerves. Capricious in little
things, he was faithful in great. His warmth of nature as a son, as a friend,
as a humanitarian, as a believer in tolerance and liberty, is so unfailing
that it is curious it should ever have been brought in question by any reader
of the letters. His quarrels are negligible when put beside his ceaseless
extravagance of good humour to his friends. His letters alone were golden
gifts, but we also find him offering his fortune to Conway when the latter
was in difficulties. "I have sense enough," he wrote, "to have real pleasure
in denying myself baubles, and in saving a very good income to make a
man happy for whom I have a just esteem and most sincere friendship."
"Blameable in ten thousand other respects," he wrote to Conway seventeen
years later, "may not I almost say I am perfect with regard to you? Since I
was fifteen have I not loved you unalterably?" "I am," he claimed towards
the end of his life, "very constant and sincere to friends of above forty
years." In his friendships he was more eager to give than to receive. Madame
du Deffand was only dissuaded from making him her heir by his threat
that if she did so he would never visit her again. Ever since his boyhood
he was noted for his love of giving pleasure and for his thoughtfulness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
regarding those he loved. The earliest of his published letters was until
recently one written at the age of fourteen. But Dr. Paget Toynbee, in his
supplementary volumes of Walpole letters, recently published, has been
able to print one to Lady Walpole written at the age of eight, which suggests
that Walpole was a delightful sort of child, incapable of forgetting a parent,
a friend, or a pet:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Dear mama, I hop you are wall, and I am very wall, and I hop papa is wal, and I
begin to slaap, and I hop al wall and my cosens like there pla things vary wall
and I hop Doly phillips is wall and pray give my Duty to papa.</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Horace Walpole</span>.<br />
</p>

<p class="in0">and I am very glad to hear by Tom that all my cruatuars are all wall.
and Mrs. Selwen has sprand her Fot and gvis her Sarves to you and I dind ther
yester Day.</p></blockquote>

<p>At Eton later on he was a member of two leagues of friendship&mdash;the
"Triumvirate," as it was called, which included the two Montagus, and the
"Quadruple Alliance," in which one of his fellows was Gray. The truth is,
Walpole was always a person who depended greatly on being loved. "One
loves to find people care for one," he wrote to Conway, "when they can have
no view in it." His friendship in his old age for the Miss Berrys&mdash;his "twin
wives," his "dear Both"&mdash;to each of whom he left an annuity of £4000,
was but a continuation of that kindliness which ran like a stream (ruffled
and sparkling with malice, no doubt) through his long life. And his kindness
was not limited to his friends, but was at the call of children and, as we have
seen, of animals. "You know," he explains to Conway, apologising for not
being able to visit him on account of the presence of a "poor little sick
girl" at Strawberry Hill, "how courteous a knight I am to distrest virgins
of five years old, and that my castle gates are always open to them." One
does not think of Walpole primarily as a squire of children, and certainly,
though he loved on occasion to romp with the young, there was little in
him of a Dickens character. But he was what is called "sympathetic." He
was sufficient of a man of imagination to wish to see an end put to the
sufferings of "those poor victims, chimney-sweepers." So far from being
a heartless person, as he has been at times portrayed, he had a heart as
sensitive as an anti-vivisectionist. This was shown in his attitude to animals.
In 1760, when there was a great terror of mad dogs in London, and an
order was issued that all dogs found in the streets were to be killed, he
wrote to the Earl of Strafford:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In London there is a more cruel campaign than that waged by the Russians:
the streets are a very picture of the murder of the innocents&mdash;one drives over nothing
but poor dead dogs! The dear, good-natured, honest, sensible creatures! Christ!
how can anybody hurt them? Nobody could but those Cherokees the English,
who desire no better than to be halloo'd to blood&mdash;one day Samuel Byng, the next
Lord George Sackville, and to-day the poor dogs!</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
As for Walpole's interest in politics, we are told by writer after writer
that he never took them seriously, but was interested in them mainly for
gossip's sake. It cannot be denied that he made no great fight for good
causes while he sat in the House of Commons. Nor had he the temper of a
ruler of men. But as a commentator on politics, and a spreader of opinion
in private, he showed himself to be a politician at once sagacious, humane,
and sensitive to the meaning of events. His detestation of the arbitrary
use of power had almost the heat of a passion. He detested it alike in a
government and in a mob. He loathed the violence that compassed the death
of Admiral Byng and the violence that made war on America. He raged
against a public world that he believed was going to the devil. "I am not
surprised," he wrote in 1776, "at the idea of the devil being always at our
elbows. They who invented him no doubt could not conceive how men could
be so atrocious to one another, without the intervention of a fiend. Don't
you think, if he had never been heard of before, that he would have been
invented on the late partition of Poland?" "Philosophy has a poor chance
with me," he wrote a little later in regard to America, "when my warmth is
stirred&mdash;and yet I know that an angry old man out of Parliament, and that
can do nothing but be angry, is a ridiculous animal." The war against America
he described as "a wretched farce of fear daubed over with airs of bullying."
War at any time was, in his eyes, all but the unforgivable sin. In 1781,
however, his hatred had lightened into contempt. "The Dutch fleet is
hovering about," he wrote, "but it is a pickpocket war, and not a martial
one, and I never attend to petty larceny." As for mobs, his attitude to them
is to be seen in his comment on the Wilkes riots, when he declares:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I cannot bear to have the name of Liberty profaned to the destruction of the cause;
for frantic tumults only lead to that terrible corrective, Arbitrary Power&mdash;which
cowards call out for as protection, and knaves are so ready to grant.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not that he feared mobs as he feared governments. He regarded them
with an aristocrat's scorn. The only mob that almost won his tolerance
was that which celebrated the acquittal of Admiral Keppel in 1779. It was
of the mob at this time that he wrote to the Countess of Ossory: "They
were, as George Montagu said of our earthquakes, <i>so tame you might have
stroked them</i>." When near the end of his life the September massacres broke
out in Paris, his mob-hatred revived again, and he denounced the French
with the hysterical violence with which many people to-day denounce the
Bolshevists. He called them "<i>inferno-human</i> beings," "that atrocious and
detestable nation," and declared that "France must be abhorred to latest
posterity." His letters on the subject to "Holy Hannah," whatever else
may be said against them, are not those of a cold and dilettante gossip.
They are the letters of the same excitable Horace Walpole who, at an earlier
age, when a row had broken out between the manager and the audience
in Drury Lane Theatre, had not been able to restrain himself, but had
cried angrily from his box, "He is an impudent rascal!" But his politics<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
never got beyond an angry cry. His conduct in Drury Lane was characteristic
of him:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The whole pit huzzaed, and repeated the words. Only think of my being a
popular orator! But what was still better, while my shadow of a person was dilating
to the consistence of a hero, one of the chief ringleaders of the riot, coming under
the box where I sat, and pulling off his hat, said, "Mr. Walpole, what would you
please to have us do next?" It is impossible to describe to you the confusion into
which this apostrophe threw me. I sank down into the box, and have never since
ventured to set my foot into the playhouse.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">There you have the fable of Walpole's life. He always in the end sank down
into his box or clambered back to his mantelpiece. Other men might save
the situation. As for him, he had to look after his squirrels and his friends.</p>

<p>This means no more than that he was not a statesman, but an artist.
He was a connoisseur of great actions, not a practiser of them. At Strawberry
Hill he could at least keep himself in sufficient health with the aid of iced
water and by not wearing a hat when out-of-doors to compose the greatest
works of art of their kind that have appeared in English. Had he written his
letters for money we should have praised him as one of the busiest and most
devoted of authors, and never have thought of blaming him for abstaining
from statesmanship as he did from wine. Possibly he had the constitution
for neither. His genius was a genius, not of Westminster, but of Strawberry
Hill. It is in Strawberry Hill that one finally prefers to see him framed,
an extraordinarily likeable, charming, and whimsical figure.</p>

<p>Back in Strawberry Hill, he is the Prince Charming among correspondents.
One cannot love him as one loves Charles Lamb and men of
a deeper and more imaginative tenderness. But how incomparable he is as
an acquaintance! How exquisite a specimen&mdash;hand-painted&mdash;for the collector
of the choice creatures of the human race!</p>

<h2>THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH</h2>

<p class="center">By J. C. STOBART</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THERE</span> is no doubt whatever about the need for it. Search high or
low in our social world, you will find it full of laments and dissatisfaction.
In the Services Commanding Officers complain that
their subalterns, even though they have been through the Classical
course at Public Schools and Universities, cannot write a clear report.
Headquarters themselves issue their orders and regulations in barbarous,
unintelligible jargon. Government Departments, manned by Greatsmen,
wrap themselves in phrases of pompous obscurity, and Cabinet Ministers
couch their decisions or agreements in terms of such ambiguity as to leave
nobody certain of their meaning. It would, however, be unjust to attribute
bad English entirely to upper-class education, classical or modern. The business
man in his "esteemed favours," though he may be more terse and polite,
is not always able to convey what he intends. He lays the blame, when he
fails to do so, upon the faulty education of his clerks and stenographers.
The masses of the public too often show in practice that they simply cannot
understand printed rules and directions. It is naturally too much to expect
a universal diffusion of taste or elegance in the use of our language; but even
when we feel the need of fine words to express deep feeling we choose for
an obituary lines like these:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There's a lonely grave somewhere,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where our dear and brave boy sleeps;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's a little home in England,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where mother and all of us weep.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">or these:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who knew that when he went away,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Departing from his door,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How or when he would come back,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or whether never more?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he who went away in health,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In battle soon waylaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which took him in the prime of life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lie in a distant grave.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>No, there is little doubt of the need for teaching clearness and improving
taste. As for correct and grammatical writing, one week's study of a popular
daily newspaper yielded the following excerpts from a collection of two-score:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the last resort we have to depend upon a jury drawn from the people to convict
the scoundrel who has tainted our public life, and unless that jury does not do its
duty, unless it is backed by the public sentiment of the people....</p>

<p>The accused was ordered to pay £3, or a month's imprisonment in default.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
At Paignton, in Devon, a gigantic plum-pudding is made and distributed to the
poor, which in 1897 weighed 250 lb.</p>

<p>... the officers closed on him. In throwing him to the ground the revolver
dropped from his hand.</p>

<p>The charge is 50 per cent. higher than the same sheet may be bought in the street
just outside. But what is a penny to an American?</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; had an unfortunate experience. While seated in his greenhouse
it was wrecked by the wind, and on being extricated it was ascertained that both his
legs were broken above the knee, necessitating his removal to the infirmary.</p>

<p>Provocation has been given by the hostile and shifty conduct of the Tibetan
authorities, since the signing of the Treaty of 1800, which would have justified
earlier punishment.</p>

<p>While riding in a hansom at Southport a runaway horse dashed into the conveyance,
and the shaft of the trap penetrated her body, pinning her to the hansom, and causing
almost instantaneous death.</p>

<p>But if you come to estimate a day's work&mdash;even in foot-pounds&mdash;the woman
who cleans, bakes, washes, and takes to school six children, carries water and tramps
upstairs and down for sixteen hours a day, need not fear comparison as to kinetic
energy even with a miner working eight hours.</p></blockquote>

<p>What is the schoolmaster doing about it? He is teaching a great variety
of languages ancient and foreign, sciences, arts and crafts, and among other
things he is believed to teach "English." He has found out that it does not
come by nature, and that a mastery of the English language cannot be assured
by teaching something quite different. But as to the best method of teaching
boys and girls to write, read, and appreciate good English there is a controversy.
Just as in most other branches of education there is a traditional
method and a reformed method. Upon the latter some of us build hopes of
extraordinarily great achievements, and if these hopes lead us into impatience
we must ask for pardon.</p>

<p>Though Mr. <span class="locked">Mais<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> justly claims credit for originality in departing occasionally
from the fixed lines of English teaching as it is practised in the
Public Schools, his "Course" mainly follows the traditional modes and
is directed to the preparation of pupils for the orthodox type of examination.
The nature of the course is indicated by the chapter-headings; for example:
"Grammar and Syntax&mdash;Analysis, Parsing and
Synthesis&mdash;Punctuation&mdash;Vocabulary&mdash;Letter-writing&mdash;Reproduction&mdash;Paraphrase&mdash;Dictation&mdash;Précis&mdash;Prosody&mdash;Figures
of Speech&mdash;Indirect Speech&mdash;Essay-writing&mdash;Examination
Papers." There are, beside these thoroughly normal chapters,
six pages on Elocution, Debating, Lecturing, Acting, etc., a useful list of
cheap books for a home library, more than fifty critical pages on Shakespeare,
and a <span class="locked">regrettable<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> twenty-page chapter entitled "Short History of English
Literature." I think the author is trying to shake off a yoke which is not
entirely congenial to him. But if he will make boys write essays on Scandinavia,
explain Synecdoche, paraphrase Keats, "condense the <i>Vision of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Mirzah</i> to 300 words," he cannot complain if he is mistaken for one of the
old regime and guillotined in distinguished company.</p>

<p>The traditional method begins with the copy-book and proceeds by way
of dictation and formal exercises to its goal in the essay. Dictation is the core
and kernel of it, for even when the exercise is called "composition" the
subjects are so chosen that the pupil needs detailed guidance throughout
and the results are practically uniform. The writing is accompanied by
reading and grammar, but the reading is severely limited and the text is
obscured by comment and minute explanation. Poetry is not only studied
with notes: it is analysed and paraphrased and parsed. The grammar,
which is also traditional, is alien both in its method and terminology. The
people who invented "English" in the middle of the nineteenth century
were the classical grammarians who knew only one way of teaching a
language, and had been forced under pressure from indignant parents to
put "English" on the syllabus. They gave it an hour a week: they spent
that hour in parsing, in declining uninflected nouns, in conjugating, in
insisting that because the complement of a Latin or Greek copulative verb
is in concord with its subject therefore "It's <i>me</i>" must be wrong in English.
They did violence to our tongue in other ways to make a Teutonic language
fit a Latin system, introducing all sorts of unnecessary complications of
gender, mood and case, which do not exist. They transferred to English
the whole cumbrous system of Latin grammatical terminology and then set
harmless English children to explain their hideous technicalities. All because
they had an hour to waste and were determined to waste it in the manner
to which they were accustomed. They were assisted in this ambition by
the Scotch professors of rhetoric who were especially strong in figures of
speech.</p>

<p>And then they remarked with pain and surprise that their method did not
succeed. Their scholars did not appreciate good literature when it was
taught to them. They lacked originality in their composition. They were
tongue-tied in their speaking and muddled in their writing. There was once
a man who determined to teach his monkey to sing "Voi che sapete," an
air of which he was inordinately fond. So he took an old stocking with a
hole in the toe and two holes in the heel and turned it inside out in order
to conceal the holes, and crammed it full with shavings and breadcrumbs
and fried it carefully and fed the monkey on it. When he complained that
the monkey's voice was no better at the end of the course, his friends used
to explain that it was because he was an old man and had lived in the reign
of Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Remember that this "English" teaching has been well tried for more
than fifty years. Substantially, the course we are considering now does not
differ in its methods from books like Dalgleish's <i>English Composition in
Prose and Verse based on Grammatical Synthesis</i> of 1864 or Dr. William
Smith's <i>English Course</i>. The subject subsists as a shuttlecock in a perpetual
game of Badminton between examiners and teachers. If you ask the examiner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
of English why he continues to set such stupid questions, he replies quite
rightly that he is forced to do so by the stupidity of the schoolmasters who
teach it. If you ask the schoolmaster why he makes his "English" the dullest
subject in the syllabus, he will probably answer that he is preparing for the
London Matriculation. If you look for an explanation of the method, you
might surmise that the aim is to secure accuracy in grammar at all costs. But
that is not the aim. Mr. Mais explains it in a paragraph which he might well
set for analysis of pronouns: "Of all our failings as a nation, this is the
most marked. In our talk we are reticent; in our writing we are incoherent
and slipshod. Every schoolmaster knows from sad experience that the
average boy cannot produce a readable essay on any subject, however hard
he may try. He strives by every means in his power to instil a sense of
originality in his classes, to teach his boys and girls to observe...."
Originality and observation!</p>

<p>To take the second first, every scoutmaster knows that observation can
be taught, but not by dictation. Probably there is no faculty of the mind
which responds so readily to training and practice. By systematic questioning
a young child can be taught to notice the common objects by the wayside
on his morning walk, the goods in the shop windows, the flowers in the
garden, to remember them and describe them afterwards with great fidelity.
A good teacher of infants can easily teach a child of six or seven to observe
minute differences, to compare and contrast similar objects, such as the
bulb of the iris and the corn of the crocus. This kind of observation is
commonly appropriated by science, and it is indeed the same faculty which
the physicist employs afterwards with his fine balances and test-tubes.
But it is also, when reproduced in language, the beginning of good English.
Words are the balances. Careful description in words, written and spoken,
of things actually seen is, when developed fully, more than half of the
business of poets, journalists, and novelists. A few gifted mortals like Balzac,
Gissing, or Hardy may possess the faculty by nature, but any one may
acquire it through early training and continuous practice. It can be lost
almost as easily as it is won.</p>

<p>Can originality be taught? Less easily perhaps than observation. Real
originality, in the sense of creative power, or what in its highest form we
call "Inspiration," cannot be taught in school. Who taught Blake to see the
tiger burning bright in midmost eighteenth-century London? There are
some men born, apparently, to be our masters. Ideas flow not into them
but out of them. They are the mainsprings of our mechanism. We attribute
their origin to the wandering breath of some holy spirit. But in a humbler
sense children can certainly be trained to be original, just as they can be
trained by opposite methods to be commonplace, slavish, imitative, genteel,
conventional, correct, and accommodating. These virtues are taught with
great diligence and success in many schools, public and private. In the
earliest stage you copy in a beautiful copperplate handwriting words like
"England Expects Every," and you read aloud very slowly from a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
book which contains these words in immense type: <span class="smcap">Shun that ox he is
shy</span>. You recite in chorus after teacher, you correct your speech by mimicking
her accents and gestures. You sit, stand, or march to numbers at the word
of command. In the next stage you are promoted to dictation, and once a
fortnight you write a composition. But as the theme is Duty or The Elephant
or something about which you can hardly be expected to have connected
notions, you are given the headings, told what to say, have your mistakes
carefully underlined, and are then presented with a model or fair copy.
Any departure from the normal, whether in spelling or in ideas, is heavily
penalised, and no credit is given for positive merit. In the next stage you
learn the art of letter-writing by studying celebrated models, you paraphrase
good poetry into bad prose, you analyse and parse and explain grammatical
terms, you summarise and expand, you turn direct into indirect speech
and generally feed your mind with a generous diet of cold minced hash.</p>

<p>If I were a little boy trained for years and years according to this plan,
I hope I should be grateful to my teachers for all the trouble they had taken
with me. But, if they then turned round upon me and reproached me with
not being <i>original</i>, I should be sorely tempted to commit a breach of good
English and say "That is the limit!"</p>

<p>In the pedagogical and psychological sense these methods are twenty
years behind the times. They have been exploded in theory and disproved
in practice. Each subject in its turn has fought its battle with the Dictation
Method, and everywhere, except perhaps in religious instruction, the
principle has been decided. In drawing, the freehand copy has given place
to direct observation; in mathematics, mechanical working of rules and
examples has been replaced by intelligence and problems. Even physical
exercises are no longer mere drill.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is in the primary school that we shall find the right principles
most clearly marked, if only because with the younger children the teacher
is nearer to Nature and mistakes punish themselves more visibly. There
also the dead weight of tradition has been less oppressive. Before Madame
Montessori's star had risen above the firmament the best teachers in English
infant schools had solved the fundamental problems of how to teach good
English. The principle is that what the child speaks or writes shall come
from its own brain. The first medium of expression is, of course, the tongue.
No children, not even English children, are tongue-tied by nature, but
they are generally timid and sensitive. If they find their adult world discouraging
communicativeness with anger, or sarcasm, or pedantry, they
will close down upon the rock of silence like the limpet which you must
smash before you move. Probably before he comes to school the child has
already been silenced by a mother or father whose love will bear anything
for the child except to listen to him. It is wonderful to watch the skilled
teacher of infants repairing this mischief, re-establishing confidence between
innocence and wisdom, unlocking hearts and tongues, creating an atmosphere
of freedom in which she possesses, in reality, absolute control. Instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
limpets you behold sea-anemones full open. The children talk at great
length in co-ordinate construction about their mother and the baby's tooth,
and when they have finished they sit quiet listening to others. Sometimes
the teacher takes up her parable and tells them about Cinderella or the
King of the Golden River. In other lessons other mediums of expression
appear&mdash;pencils, chalk, plastic clay, music, dance, drama. The teacher
continues unobtrusively feeding the children with beautiful things, she sings
and plays to them, shows them pictures and exhibits gentleness, calm, and
love.</p>

<p>Amid all the fog of controversy and all the noise of disputing cheap-jacks
that surrounds the art and practice of education I see some of these infants'
class-rooms as clear beacons showing the incontestably true course. I cannot
see any limit of years to its progress. Many boys' and girls' schools have
grasped the same principles and extended them to the age of fourteen with
the same undeniable success in the results. Naturally, as the child grows
the method has to be adapted, but the principle remains steadfast. I would
not describe it as "freedom," because the child is not free, though he feels
free. One never doubts the existence of a controlling will. But what is
encouraged is authentic expression. In writing, topics are set which draw
out of the child's own world the child's own thoughts. He is guided to think
for himself and to speak his thoughts fearlessly. The skill of the teacher
is shown mainly in the choice of subjects and the discretion with which
corrections are made. Observation is translated into description, first in
speech and then, when the pencil has been mastered, in writing. A child of
nine may be asked to describe a corner of the class-room so that a blind man
could understand exactly what is there and what it looks like. A child of
twelve may be asked to describe the prettiest room she ever saw. A child
of fourteen may be asked to describe the Harrow Road (<i>a</i>) on a Saturday
night, (<i>b</i>) on a Sunday morning. Why stop at fourteen?</p>

<p>As well as observation and description, the infant school trains the elements
of imagination and invention. Cannot the child who at eight years old wrote
on "If I were the King...." profitably be asked to write on "If I had
been Oliver Cromwell...." at eighteen? In one girls' school the
teacher merely wrote on the blackboard "When the Moon went out" and
left the rest to the class. In the same way children can be trained to argue
<i>pro</i> and <i>contra</i> about problems of their own lives which clearly admit of
argument, like "Would you rather be six or sixteen?" "Would you rather
be a boy or a girl?" People new to the method might suppose that, although
the brighter children could possibly attack such themes with success, the
ordinary or dull child would be left staring. It is not so. Whole classes of
children trained in this way produce work which is pleasant to read. The
essentials seem to be stimulating topics, authentic expression without
dictation, and constant practice. To one who has seen the elementary steps
there is no magic in the Perse Plays or the Draconian Poems. They are
natural. It is dullness that is artificial. Real dullness, such as one finds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
Common Rooms, Mess Rooms, Pulpits, and Government Offices is the
fruit of a long, careful, and generally expensive education in that quality.</p>

<p>In teaching a young person to speak and write you are also teaching him
to think, because words represent thoughts. The adult may be able to think
connectedly in silence, but the child generally cannot. The child's world is,
however, at the largest a little one, and it is necessary to enlarge it by various
means, including stories and pictures, songs and books. The book gradually
becomes more prominent as the art of reading is mastered. A child constantly
encouraged to express himself freely, always giving out and seldom
taking in, would develop a number of unpleasant qualities. Therefore
reading is only second to writing in its importance. A generous supply of
good books is the second fundamental necessity of sound English teaching.
So far as I know, no school has ever reached the limit in this direction.
There is an excellent society which bases its method of teaching mainly on
copious reading and has been able to multiply seven-fold the usual reading
programme of primary schools. But they seem to put the book a little too
much into the foreground. It is citizens that we seek to educate. For them
books should be the background of real life. We do not all possess those
opulent libraries into which Ruskin would turn his princesses to browse at
will; but I subscribe to his doctrine in principle. Mere quantity of reading is
a great thing. The more children read, the better they will choose their books.</p>

<p>Now these two things alone, authentic expression and copious reading,
are capable of producing good English. Children taught well in these
methods can, without any formal instruction in spelling or grammar, write
correctly as well as pleasantly. Something more is needed for those who
seek to become scholars in English, and still more if they aim at the study
of language. For such as these the teaching may gradually and progressively
develop a scientific character. In the earliest stages fluency was itself a
chief aim, and the teacher was compelled to be very sparing of interruptions
and corrections. She had to use discretion and to judge for herself what
mistakes were dangerous. She might not interpose though twenty successive
clauses were joined together by "and," because she knew that it is natural
for language to begin with co-ordinates and that mere mental growth combined
with practice in reading and writing will cure the fault. She corrected
vulgarisms, like "he done it," not with any grammatical disquisition but
dogmatically. Even where the children come from homes where the King's
English is never spoken, systematic speech-training in the infants' school
can correct and refine language before pen is put to paper. These infant
years seem to be intended by Nature for the learning of language. Ears are
sharp and memories retentive. But habits once formed at that age, whether
good or bad, are very difficult to eradicate later on. Perhaps pronunciation
is best taught through disguised phonetics in the singing lesson and elocution
in the poetry lesson.</p>

<p>In the first written work it may be found that the spelling is all wrong.
Great controversies rage on this subject. But it seems right to regard bad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
spelling as a disease which needs careful individual diagnosis in the earliest
stages, when it can be cured so as to give no more trouble. Most often it
springs from some fault in the method by which the child has learnt to read.
Some people are allowed to grow up incapable of spelling because they
make out the printed word by some process of guesswork and never fix
the letters upon their memory. Good or bad spelling very rapidly becomes
automatic.</p>

<p>Much the same is true of grammar. As I have said before, accurate use
of language can be attained by purely empirical and dogmatic methods.
Grammar is no essential preliminary to good English, but nevertheless there
may be a good case for teaching it later on to those who can afford the
time. It is well that English boys and girls should know something of the
history and structure of their language as well as their constitution. It may
be necessary for the linguist to understand the common grammatical
technique of all languages. Moreover, teachers naturally seek to limit the
domain of mere dogma and to give explanations where they can. Thus a
child can easily be cured of saying "Between you and I" merely through
the teacher's command, "Say <i>me</i>." He can be cured of saying "Like I did"
in the same way. He will of course be on surer ground if he understands the
reason. Only let it be English grammar and not Latin grammar that is used.
The reason why the child should say "I am taller than he" is, if a reason
must be given, that <i>than</i> is historically identical with <i>then</i>, not that "<i>quam</i>
takes the same case after it as before it."</p>

<p>If we could only keep our eyes steadily fixed on the goal and discard
formalism, tradition, and antiquated examinations, there is in the work
of the best infants' and elementary schools a broad enough base for us to
build a sound structure of English up to the University and beyond. Perhaps
some day a progressive University may try the experiment of an English
Arts Course in which the first part would consist solely of Advanced Reading
and Writing, and the second part of options between English Philosophy,
English Philology, English Poetics, or English Criticism. It need not be
any lower in standard than an Oxford Greats course.</p>

<p>We could not well spare the scholars. On the contrary, those who believe
with me that English contains all things necessary to culture will be most
anxious to enlist for its service the finest scholarship of the day. Some will
think the fare provided in such a course as I have outlined too rich in sugar
or fat and wanting in the tougher constituents which produce bone and
muscle. It is essential to require more and more precision and accuracy as
the child passes through the phases of adolescence. This was the real virtue
of the old classical training, and it is too often wanting on Modern Sides.
We must contemplate something very like the best of classical teaching
applied to English Classics for big boys and girls.</p>

<p>I write as a Pharisee of the Pharisees, brought up at the feet of Gamaliel.
A man like Robert Whitelaw loved the literature of Greece and Rome
with such devotion that its very forms were sacred to him. A false quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
or a false concord was to him a personal affront: it caused him physical
pain. Accents and particles mattered to him and so they mattered to us.
There was a right and a wrong. We did not understand why, but we knew
and felt his scorn of anything careless or superficial. He read Sophocles
aloud with an intensity that at first puzzled and then infected us. Occasionally,
but all too rarely, it was his task to do the same with Chaucer or
Browning. Why not?</p>

<p>But at this point I labour with a sense of unreality. Is it possible to capture
for our language a tithe of that old classical fervour? We have buried our
Grammarian upon his peak, fronting the sunrise. He settled <i>hoti's</i> business.
I have heard him lecture for an hour upon the future sense of the optative
with an enthusiasm that was drawn from some pure source in the depths.
Doubtless he survives in disciples. Is it the mere mystery and power of
the Word that inspires them? I will not believe that it is any inherent virtue
possessed by Propertius but denied to Shelley that inspires the classical
scholar. But where are our inspired teachers of English? I have an impression
of critical, quizzical gentlemen, deeply learned in Elizabethan drama or
Saxon dialect, but all the same terribly mild. I cannot picture one of their
disciples seriously moved by a misplaced "and which" or an unrelated
participle in English. Something is missing.</p>

<p>There are thousands of genuine lovers of English literature scattered
up and down the country, people who feel the thrill of delight in verbal
beauty quite as keenly as any classical scholar. But they want leaders and a
voice. We suffer our fools too gladly in English studies. Any lunatic is
allowed to criticise, traduce, misinterpret Dryden, Carlyle, Addison, even
Shakespeare, as if they were our private playthings. They are not. They are
worthy of their pedestals of worship just as much as Homer and Aristotle.</p>

<p>The issue of the War has established more firmly than ever the predominance
of the English language in the world. If our schools would rise to
their opportunity and raise English into a culture worthy of its qualities
there seems no reason why it should not become the universal medium of
civilisation for the world. The richness and variety of its literature and the
simplicity and flexibility of its structure render it, as a language, amply
sufficient. Whether this is visionary or not, it is no longer safe for those
who cherish the humanities in education to rely upon the old impregnable
position of Latin and Greek. The world has received one of those secular
shocks in which tradition crumbles to dust.</p>

<h2>AN ARTICLE ON PARTICLES</h2>

<p class="center">By ALICE MEYNELL</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Inconquerable</i>"&mdash;BACON</p>

<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap1">A GENERAL</span> good habit might long ago have been ruled for our
national literature in the use of two negatives&mdash;"un" or "in,"
and "less." A good rule once made known, long ago, would
surely have lasted. We might set about it even yet, though with
much to chastise. Let us try. The fault of "un" and "in" is of long
standing. That of a misapplied "less" is probably quite modern. What I
have to suggest is an obvious enough correction, but the offence is broadcast,
therefore correction cannot surely be inopportune or importunate. For who
is there who does not give the teutonic "un" to the Latin or Romance
word, writing "unfortunate" or "ungracious"? Or who now is careful
to write "inconquerable"? Any man to-day would certainly write
"unconquerable." It may not be that Bacon is always consistent; nor is
Landor, who had something&mdash;but that something has proved altogether
ineffectual&mdash;to say on this question of good English. We must own the
incorrect use of the German particle to be the commonest thing in the world,
but the incorrect use of the Latin or Romantic derivative, on the other
hand, does not occur.</p>

<p>The Teutonic "un" comes more readily to the English pen than the Latin
"in," and thus is joined habitually to the wrong kind of adjective and verb
and adverb. Not only, moreover, to the Romantic word, but also to the Greek.
We have learnt to write "asymmetry," but not to avoid "unsymmetrical."
There is also a very frequent jumble, so that "uncivil" appears in the same
phrase with "incivility," and "unable" with "inability," "undigested"
with "indigestible," "ungrateful" with "ingratitude"&mdash;but I need cite
no more. It is worth noting that these confusions are not due to a kind of
reluctance in the use of "un" for nouns. We have many nouns with the
"un" (not otherwise to my purpose): "unrest," "unbelief," "unfaith,"
"unhappiness," "untruth," "unthrift," "unskilfulness," and so forth.</p>

<p>Now I know well that the reader has been courteously waiting until I
should draw breath for a paragraph in order to say "<i>Undiscovered</i>: Shakespeare."
It is all too true. I can only repeat, murmuring, "<i>Inconquerable</i>:
Bacon."</p>

<p>There is nothing in English that we should prize more dearly than our
right negative particles of both derivations, and especially our particle of
German derivation in its right Teutonic place. That "un" implies, encloses
so much, denies so much, refuses so much, point-blank, with a tragic irony
that French, for example, can hardly compass. Compare our all-significant
"unloved," "unforgiven," with any phrase of French. There are abysses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
in those words, at our summons, deep calling to deep, dreadful or tender
passion, the thing and its undoing locked together, grappled. But in order
to keep these great significances the "un" should not be squandered
as we squander it. And neither should the less closely embraced "in" be
so neglected. It has its right place and dignity and is, as it were, more deliberate.
It is worth while, furthermore, to enhance the value of both our
negative particles (one of them, of course, shared with French) by considering
how poor a negative that last-named tongue has often and often
to use for lack of a better; not even a particle, but a thing unfastened, a
weak separate word, a half-hearted denial&mdash;"<i>peu</i>." Let us try to keep
our "un" in its right place by considering how, for instance, it makes of
"undone" a word of incomparable tragedy, surpassing "defeated" and
"ruined" and all others of their kind. "Undone" has the purely English
faculty, moreover, of giving to a little familiar word a sudden greatness,
such greatness as leaps to Lear's "every inch." This was found to be
intranslatable when Rossi acted King Lear in Italian; he had to speak the
phrase in English. Wonderfully well furnished as we are for all adventures,
is it not then time that we reviewed and revised our habits, and restored
to their proper lineage the great contemporary histories of our language
by a right and left distribution of the "in" and the "un"? Our incorrect
ways were never standardized, or they standardized themselves by precedent.
No, it is all too late. We shall never undo the habit now, or cease to be
"unconscious" in our custom.</p>

<p>But for the other particle&mdash;"the less"&mdash;there is hope or there might be,
but for Shakespeare's strange and slightly ambiguous "viewless." We
might at least check new coinings. "Less" is in the construction here to
be considered, though not in other combinations, fairly equivalent to the
Teutonic "without." It has great value. It also locks close meanings with its
word. But that word should be a noun, and not a verb. Yet it is a verb at
the present day, not only in hasty column after column, but in page by
deliberate page, and especially in stanza by deliberate stanza. For no doubt
the perfervid poets have spread that fashion. You will find "relentless"
scattered in modern verse, and "quenchless" and "tireless" frequent.
Keats, instigated indirectly if not directly by Leigh Hunt, has "utterless."
The misuse of "less" is even somewhat more to be resisted than that of
"un" because in the case first named the grammatical construction of our
English words (and we have not too many laws of construction) is violated.
And beautiful words that are neglected for "quenchless" and "relentless"
pass out of use; the words that have "less" for their lawful negative are
cheapened; and writers of talent learn to dash and as it were to gesticulate.</p>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTES AND NEWS</h2>

<p class="center"><i>Correspondence from readers on all subjects of bibliographical interest is invited. The
Editor will, to the best of his ability, answer all queries addressed to him.</i></p>

<h3 class="left">GENERAL NOTES</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">WE</span> are glad to see that the Clarendon Press has published Mr. Percy Simpson's
edition of <i>Every Man in His Humour</i>, a pioneer volume to the
complete edition of Ben Jonson's Works, which the same editor, in conjunction
with Professor Herford, has been for many years preparing.
Their edition should, we think, be definitive (we use Sir Eric's magical
word with extreme caution for fear of provoking the National Union of Textual Editors
to down books and refuse to continue their researches). A new edition of Ben Jonson's
work is certainly needed: Gifford, re-edited by Cunningham, is sadly inadequate; the text
is bad and the notes explain nothing that one wants to know. One walks darkling through
the <i>Discoveries</i>. Take Ben's remarks about painting&mdash;they are Hermetic. What, for
instance, does this mean? "Parrhasius was the first won reputation by adding symmetry
to picture.... Eupompus gave it splendour by numbers and other elegancies."
We shall indeed be grateful to the new editors if they can tell us exactly how Eupompus
gave splendour to art by numbers&mdash;and other elegancies. The secret might be whispered
along the galleries of Burlington House.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Another interesting book that should soon, though there is no news of its immediate
arrival, be coming from the Clarendon Press is the third volume of Mr. Saintsbury's
<i>Caroline Poets</i>. The first two volumes of this massive anthology opened up a whole
province of literature hitherto almost unknown to the general reader. In the last this
great work of excavation and exploration should be completed. With the exception
of Chamberlayne and the Matchless Orinda the Carolines of Mr. Saintsbury's choice
have been very obscure. In the last volume, we understand, he intends to soar to the
dizzy heights of eminence on which Cleveland stands. A good critical edition of
Cleveland will be welcomed by all lovers of seventeenth-century literature. The early
editions of his works are a piratical sort of publication. Some of his poems were, even
in his own life-time, attributed to other writers, notably his <i>Hermaphrodite</i>, which was
fathered on Randolph, and which he claimed as his own in an amusing little poem
appended, later on, to the stolen piece. And yet, in spite of Cleveland's claim to his own
property, Carew Hazlitt, in his reprint of Randolph, continues to attribute the
<i>Hermaphrodite</i> to its wrongful owner. A very unnecessary and supererogatory blunder.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>While we are on the subject of the Caroline Poets we would like to express a pious
hope that some day, when we are all immensely rich, the Clarendon Press, or some
other great publishing institution, will bring out a complete corpus of English poetry.
More than a century has elapsed since Chalmers issued his <i>English Poets</i>, and the book,
in spite of bad editing and very imperfect&mdash;indeed non-existent&mdash;critical apparatus, is
still an extremely useful one. It contains a complete Gower, a complete Lydgate, a
complete Hawes, and a complete Skelton. The text of these older poets is indeed
atrocious; but the fact remains that they are there, reprinted and easily accessible in
Chalmers's stout volumes. For any study of the eighteenth century Chalmers is
invaluable; everything is in him, from the <i>Ruins of Rome</i> to the <i>Pleasures of Digestion</i>&mdash;or
is it the <i>Art of Preserving Health</i>? A well-edited Chalmers would be a work of immense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
value. And if the Clarendon Press would go on, in the same edition, from the Carolines
to the Georgians and back, through the Elizabethans and Tudors as far as the Brutians
(the contemporaries of our first Trojan king), we should be for ever grateful. But
before that comes to pass we must all, as has already been hinted, be immensely rich</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A rather battered Purchas's <i>Pilgrim</i> minus its title-page came into our hands recently.
It appears to be the second edition, but the only actual indication of date that we can
discover is to be found in the following passage, on which by a happy chance we lighted
while turning over the pages of the book. "Sultan Achmet is now, Anno 1613, five and
twentie yeares old: of good stature, strong and active more than any of his Court. He
hath three thousand Concubines." We cannot help believing that someone had been
pulling the Reverend Samuel Purchas's leg on the subject of young Sultan Achmet's
harem.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The other day we bought a charming little first edition of <i>Candide</i> (1759). The title-page
is amusing: "Candide, ou l'Optimisme, traduit de l'Allemand de Mr. le Docteur
Ralph"; no publisher or place, but the date MDCCLIX. It was often Voltaire's custom
not to acknowledge his publications till they were a success. <i>Zadig</i> (1749) is similarly
without author's or publisher's name.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Perhaps some of our readers may be able to throw some light on a curious and
interesting book, <i>Specimens of Macaronic Poetry</i>, published by J. Richard Beckley in
1831. The volume contains epics written on a single letter, like that which begins:</p>

<p>We were fortunate in recently securing a very fine copy of <i>Certaine Learned and
Elegant Workes of the Right Honourable Fulke Lord Brooke, written in his Youth and
familiar Exercise with Sir Philip Sidney</i>, Henry Seyle, 1633. It is high time that a new
edition of these very interesting and, by moments, very great poems was published.
Grosart's reprint is faulty and is, furthermore, practically unprocurable. As a matter
of fact a new edition was, we understand, in process of being prepared by a very able
young scholar of Christ Church, when the war broke out and the would-be editor was
unhappily killed. Mr. Rose had, we believe, made considerable researches and had even
discovered a certain amount of new material, but he had not committed the results of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
his labours to paper; so that the possible new edition of Greville has perished with him.
If the rest of Greville's works could be edited as well as his Life of Sidney has been by
Mr. Nowell Smith we should be very well pleased. But the prospect of getting any new
edition at all seems now extremely unlikely.</p>

<h3 class="left">RECENT ADDITIONS TO LIBRARIES</h3>

<p>Some early printed books of considerable interest have recently been added to the
Library of the British Museum, among them a copy of Sannazaro's <i>Arcadia</i>, Venice,
1502, in a contemporary binding of boards covered with designs printed from woodblocks.
<i>Terentius: Comediæ cum interpretatione Donati</i>, Baptista de Tortis, Venice,
1482. <i>Elegantiolae</i>, by Augustinus Datus, produced at Verona by an unidentified
printer in 1483. <i>Ptolemaeus, Liber quadripartit</i>, Ratdolt, Venice, 1484. Maurice de
Sully, Bishop of Paris: <i>Les exposicions des euungilles en romant</i>, Antoine Neyret,
Chambéry, 1484. (Only four fully authenticated incunabula of Chambéry are known,
of which this is the earliest and rarest. It is printed in large Gothic type and adorned
with woodcuts. The Museum possesses specimens of the second, third, and fourth
Chambéry books, and this is a perfect copy of the first.) <i>Jo: Balbus Januensis</i>: Catholicon,
Jean du Pré, Lyon, 1492. Several examples of early Spanish printing have also been
presented, as well as two first editions of Swinburne, <i>Laus Veneris</i>, Moxon, 1866, and
<i>Dolores</i>, Hotten, 1867, with "The Devil's Duel: a letter to the editor of <i>The Examiner</i>,"
an attack on Robert Buchanan, written by Swinburne under the pseudonym of Thomas
Maitland, and printed for private circulation in 1875.</p>

<h3 class="left">ITEMS FROM THE BOOKSELLERS' CATALOGUES</h3>

<p>With the present boom in seventeenth-century literature one is unlikely, to judge
from the catalogues of the better-known booksellers, to pick up many bargains in
Caroline literature in London. The collector's only hope will be chance or the oversight
or ignorance of the vendor. We know of someone who recently had the good fortune
to find a copy of the extremely scarce <i>Lyric Poems</i> of Philip Ayres (1687) in a parcel of
miscellaneous rubbish. But that was a stroke of luck not likely to be repeated, and
collectors must be prepared to pay pretty heavily for their seventeenth century now.
The following items from various catalogues will indicate the current scale of prices
for early editions of Jacobean and Caroline books. We shall be interested to see the
prices fetched in the sale of the third portion of the late Mr. W. J. Leighton's stock,
at Messrs. Sotheby's in the last days of October. The catalogue makes mention of
many extremely interesting seventeenth-century books as well as important manuscripts
and early printed books.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Messrs. Dobell offer eight first editions of Richard Brathwaite. <i>Barnabee's Journall</i>,
published by John Haviland in 1638, is priced at £48, and <i>Ar't Asleepe Husband?
A Boulster Lecture</i>, 1640, at £25. Two more copies of this last work are included among
the books at the Leighton sale. The second edition of Carew's Poems (1642), in the
original calf, is offered at ten guineas; and a first edition of Dekker's <i>Tragi-Comedy,
called Match Mee in London</i> (1631), at £14. A copy of the 1772 edition of Carew's
Poems, originally the property of Mrs. Browning, with her maiden name and date,
1842, on the title-page, is on sale at the Serendipity Bookshop, price four guineas.
Another book of Mrs. Browning's at the Serendipity Shop is Samuel Daniel's <i>History
of the Civil Wars</i>, 1717. This is one of those odd reprints of Elizabethan poets that
are to be found scattered up and down the eighteenth century. Perhaps the most
unexpected of them is the folio <i>Works of Michael Drayton, Esq.; A celebrated Poet in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Reigns of Queen Elizabeth, King James I., and Charles I.</i>, printed by J. Hughs and sold
by R. Dodsley, 1748. Among other valuable seventeenth-century books at the
Serendipity Shop are Crashaw's <i>Carmen Deo Nostro</i> in the original vellum, printed at
Paris, 1652, £40, a second edition of Herbert's <i>Temple</i>, and a first edition of <i>Hesperides,
or the works, both Human and Divine, of Robert Herrick, Esq.</i>, £140.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is interesting to note what high prices the works of Surtees can always command.
In Mr. Frank Hollings's catalogue a set of the Sporting novels, with Leech's illustrations,
one of them a first edition and the others early issues, is offered for £37 10<i>s.</i></p>

<p>On the other hand, a first edition of <i>Friendship's Garland</i> can be bought at
Messrs. Dobell's for 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, and a first edition of Buchanan's <i>Book of Orm</i> for
half-a-crown.</p>

<p>People still seem prepared to pay high prices for odds and ends from the nineties.
Mr. Hollings has a complete Savoy at £7 10<i>s.</i> and two first editions of Oscar Wilde at
nearly four pounds apiece.</p>

<p>A first edition of <i>Trilby</i> (1895) can be purchased for 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> at Messrs. Dobell's, and of
<i>Daniel Deronda</i> (1876) at 18<i>s.</i> <i>Evan Harrington</i>, in the twelve original parts of <i>Once a
Week</i>, is offered at 25<i>s.</i> at the Serendipity Shop.</p>

<p>Mr. Everard Meynell has a curiosity of nineteenth-century literature for sale in the
shape of Coventry Patmore's <i>Odes</i>, dated 1868, but never published, for the following
reason: "Early in 1868 he had written nine odes, which in the April of that year he
printed for private circulation. Afterwards, keenly mortified at the coldness of their
reception by friends, he made a fire in the hall and cast on it (as he thought) all the
copies remaining in his hand, while he calmly sat and watched them burn. A friend,
who had heard of the intended bonfire, persuaded his daughter Emily to abstract a
copy or two, and these, with the few which had been sent to friends, were all that
remained of the edition." The price of this soul saved from the burning is £8 10<i>s.</i>, and
a first edition of <i>The Unknown Eros</i> (1878), with inscription from the author to Richard
Garnett, is priced £2 10<i>s.</i></p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Having recently picked up cheap a third edition (1872) of FitzGerald's <i>Omar Khayyám</i>
(Quaritch, 1872), we are interested to see that a copy of the fourth edition (1879) is for
sale at three guineas. We suspect ourselves of having made a bargain, but are not
yet quite sure.</p>

<h2 class="gesperrt">CORRESPONDENCE</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;On the assumption&mdash;I hope justified&mdash;that you propose to have a "Correspondence
Column" in your paper, I write to plead that you should devote some of your attention to
the subject of what is, I believe, called "book production." That your guidance as to the
contents of books will be valuable I do not doubt; but I feel that an organ such as yours might
be of considerable service if it would determine to devote some consideration to their physical
form.</p>

<p>It may fairly be said, I think, that, as a body, English publishers produce their books as
respectably as any publishers in the world. The Germans produce&mdash;or produced before the
war&mdash;a larger number of agreeable-looking cheap books, and a larger number of finely-printed
and bound editions <i>de luxe</i>, such as were specialised in by firms like Langen of Munich. But
the ordinary German book of commerce was frequently very shoddy and the pseudo-romantic
"Albert Memorial" tradition had never been entirely shaken off. The French presses issue
many books which are a delight to possess. Their tradition is an old one. It can be traced
through the delicate eighteenth-century editions, with their unequalled engravings, back to
the Estiennes and the Torys, who were infinitely superior to the printers of their time.
Throughout the last fifty years French publishers and "societies of bibliophiles" have
issued editions of poetry and of old rarities exquisite in their taste: beautifully printed on the
best paper and never eccentric. But the ordinary French novel or political book, printed in
blunt unattractive type and "bound" in yellow paper covers, which fall in pieces at a touch,
is certainly not a model that anyone would wish to copy. Much may be said against our
wood-pulp paper and our common cloth bindings; but, on the whole, we certainly clothe
most books in garments more durable than the books deserve; and the same thing holds good
of America, though there the types and bindings are, as a rule, uglier than ours.</p>

<p>The fact remains that not one book out of twenty that we produce can be called beautiful,
and that fifteen out of twenty are indisputably ugly. That the "public" will ever demand
an improvement is a fantastic dream. The ordinary reader likes a nice book when he sees
it, but will never make an "effective demand" on his own account. We have to rely on the
initiative, largely disinterested, of (1) the publishers, (2) the authors, and (3) the critics.</p>

<p>Publishers, we know, must earn their living like other men; their chief attention must be
given to procuring saleable "matter." But they have to get their books printed, and they have
to get them bound; and while they are about it they would lose nothing, and we should all
gain something, if they would see to it that the work was done by someone who cared about
types and was anxious to make the best of the materials available at a specified price. Authors,
again, may often be heard complaining that they do not like the look of their books; but does
any author (except Mr. Bernard Shaw and a few bibliophiles who patently supervise the
job themselves) ever take any steps to secure a "production" of which he would approve?
Finally, though the critics occasionally praise a book for being "beautifully printed" or
tastefully "bound," not one of them seems to make a regular practice of commenting on the
physical design of books&mdash;which, after all, is an ingredient in our civilisation just as much as
the design of cottages.</p>

<p>I should, as I say, be relieved to hear that the <span class="smcap">Mercury</span>, from which we all hope so much,
intends to "do its bit" in this connection.&mdash;Yours faithfully,</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="smcap">Original Subscriber.</span><br />
</p>

<p>[We think our correspondent is a little hard on English publishers. Some of them, though
a minority, seldom produce an unattractive book; and the book-production of them all is on
a higher average level than it was ten years ago, or has ever been in our time. But we agree
that there is room for improvement, and scope for commendation or the reverse; and we
purpose in our next issue to institute a regular page of "Book Production Notes," which we
hope will give our correspondent satisfaction.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span> L.M.]</p>

<h2>BOOKS OF THE MONTH</h2>

<h3>POETRY</h3>

<h4 class="left">REYNARD THE FOX. By <span class="smcap">John Masefield</span>. Heinemann. 5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It is an agreeable thing to find a man whose work has been overpraised writing better
than he has ever done before. Mr. Masefield's earlier narrative poems were panegyrised
for their vices: their unreal plots, their bad psychology, their sentimentality, their jog-trot
metres. He; wiser in his generation, appears to have realised that the best parts
of them were the "descriptions": details of vivid imagery, pictures of scenes and
brief incidents; and that where he was dealing with a person he was at his best when the
person was alone and in one self-centred mood. The picture of the widow alone in her
cottage was worth all that incredible plot in the <i>Widow in the Bye Street</i>; the public-house
scene and the birds following the plough remain in the memory when Saul
Kane's spiritual struggles have faded away; Dauber was little more than a means of
arriving at that peaceful entry when the ship trod the quiet waters of the harbour
like a fawn; and landscapes were the only excuse for <i>The Daffodil Fields</i>. Mr.
Masefield (who very likely realises that <i>Biography</i>, a poem that will not die, is the best
thing he has done) seems to have discovered his bent. In <i>Reynard the Fox</i> there is only
one leading character, the fox, and he is shown in no complicated relationships. It is
the description of a chase and of a fight for life, and we could not hope to see it better
done. Mr. Masefield's faults of writing are still evident. Lines like</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He, too (a year before), had had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A zest for going to the bad<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">might have come out of one of the numerous parodies which have been perpetrated at
his expense; he is unscrupulous in rhyming, he takes pot-shots with words, and he is
occasionally grossly sentimental. But none of these faults is bad enough in this poem to
get in the way. It is a poem to read again as soon as one has forgotten it, and it will
give equal enjoyment every time.</p>

<p>The opening section, which describes the meet, is a little too drawn out; too much
time is taken up with describing a multitude of characters, once seen and then forgotten.
But no Dutch painter ever gave a better idea of the bustle about an inn than Mr.
Masefield does, and the approach of the Hunt is done deliciously. We would spare
little of the long description of the hounds who come round the corner in front of the
red-coats:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Intent, wise, dipping, trotting, straying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling at people, shoving, playing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nosing to children's faces, waving<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their feathery sterns and all behaving,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">and then draw round Tom Dansey on the green in front of the Cock and Pye:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Arrogant, Daffodil, and Queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closest, but all in little space.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some lolled their tongues, some made grimace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yawning, or tilting nose in quest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All stood and looked about with zest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They were uneasy as they waited.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>
<p class="in0">Byron said the octosyllabic metre is the easiest to write. It is, unvaried, the most
monotonous to read. Mr. Masefield, who breaks into anapæstic passages when hounds
are in full cry, pulls it off all the way. It was not an easy thing to supply enough bite to
descriptions of earth, tree, and sky, to invent enough novel incidents, to enable us to
follow without fatigue a ten or fourteen miles chase across country. But it has been
done, and Mr. Masefield has also succeeded in intensely interesting us in the fox without
(as a rule) making him any less an animal. When he finds one earth and then another
stopped the reader's feelings are what they are when a hero of romance walks blind
along the plank, and it is with an immense relief that, in the end, we find the fox (at
the expense of another) escapes. The final description of the rested fox's nocturnal
hunt and the hounds going home is admirable fresh painting. Here is the close:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the moon came quiet and flooded full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light and beauty on clouds like wool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a feasted fox at rest from hunting,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the beech-wood grey where the brocks were grunting.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The beech-wood grey rose dim in the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With moonlight fallen in pools of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The long dead leaves on the ground were rimed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A clock struck twelve and the church bells chimed.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It is just the end of such a day.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE SUPERHUMAN ANTAGONISTS. By <span class="smcap">Sir William Watson</span>. Hodder
&amp; Stoughton. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Nobody could accuse Sir William Watson of over-colloquialism, morbid violence, or
carelessness. A slight infusion of those vices might do him good. He is determined to
be as lofty and orotund as Milton, as grave as Matthew Arnold, as sage as Wordsworth,
if he can manage it; and the result is often a cold and carven monument of respectable
but uninspired verse akin to the better of the large tombs in Westminster Abbey. On
every page of his title-poem (a debate between Ormuzd and Ahriman) we find lines like</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza vspace">
<span class="i0">Legible haply in that brow benign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rashnu and Vayu and great Mithra, sons<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the huge monster's dragon armature,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Out of the pregnant and parturient dust<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Large hereditaments of bliss and woe,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">sentences, however mighty their mould, which are to modern poetry what Lord Chaplin's
speeches are to modern oratory. This much, however, can be said for Sir William, that
his brain is always working in spite of his lordly panoply of words outworn, and he who
can penetrate his language will arrive at some sort of argument. The shorter poems
are also magniloquent, and, like the longer one, barely escape commonplaceness
by a certain activity of mind. But the language would not have been poorer had none
of them been written.</p>

<h4 class="left">MORE TRANSLATIONS FROM THE CHINESE. By <span class="smcap">Arthur Waley</span>. Allen
&amp; Unwin. 3<i>s.</i> and 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Waley's 170 <i>Chinese Poems</i> (Constable) was one of the most memorable books of
recent years; and, what is more, was instantly recognised as such. Even those of us
(and we can certainly claim to be a majority) who do not know Chinese could tell at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
sight that they were accurate beyond the wont of translations. They were obviously
beautiful poems in the original tongue, and they became beautiful English poems
through Mr. Waley, who has handled unrhymed verse as skilfully as anyone alive or
dead, with a variety of rhythm and a flow of sound correspondent to sense, which is
amazing in translations. The new collection should not be missed by anyone who has
the old one; those who have not should get the old one (which contains a historical
sketch, and which, on the whole, covers better poems) before this one. In his second
collection Mr. Waley still devotes most of his space to Po Chu'i, really a greater poet
than Li Po, of whom we have heard so much. The poems from him are again very
diverse in subject and mood; and the more we see of him the more his personality
attracts us. We may quote two shorter examples. One is <i>The Cranes</i>, which has the
terseness, the melancholy, the directness of the best of Verlaine:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The western wind has blown but a few days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the first leaf already flies from the bough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the drying paths I walk in my thin shoes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the first cold I have donned my quilted coat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through shallow ditches the floods are clearing away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through sparse bamboos trickles a slanting light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the early dusk, down an alley of green moss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The garden boy is leading the cranes home.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Po Chu'i's mild humour is seen in <i>The Lazy Man's Song</i> (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 811):</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I have got patronage, but am too lazy to use it;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have got land, but am too lazy to farm it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My house leaks; I am too lazy to mend it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My clothes are torn; I am too lazy to darn them.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have got wine, but I am too lazy to drink;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So it's just the same as if my cellar were empty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have got a harp, but am too lazy to play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So it's just the same as if it had no strings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wife tells me there is no more bread in the house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I want to bake, but am too lazy to grind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friends and relatives write me long letters;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should like to read them, but they're such a bother to open.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have always been told that Chi Shu-yeh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed his whole life in absolute idleness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he played the harp and sometimes transmuted metals.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So even <i>he</i> was not so lazy as I.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The finest thing in the book is perhaps Ch'u Yuan's <i>The Great Summons</i>. That is
too long to quote; but we cannot resist Mr. Waley's version of a brief lyric by Li Po,
<i>Self-Abandonment</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sat drinking and did not notice the dusk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till falling petals filled the folds of my dress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drunken I rose and walked to the moonlit stream;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The birds were gone, and men also few.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>These translations may be not without their influence on English poetry; and though
the Chinese spirit is not ours, the example of their exactitude and economy will not be
thrown away.</p>

<h4 class="left">COLLECTED POEMS OF LORD ALFRED DOUGLAS. Secker. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>In a note Lord Alfred Douglas observes that all great art is founded on morality; and
that "good poetry is made up of two things: style and sincerity." These apophthegms
are brief and unelaborate but indisputable. Unfortunately he proceeds to say that poetry
has never sunk so low as now, and that "there is not a good poet among the lot," which
suggests that he does not know where to look for poetry. He is out of touch with the
time, and it is unfortunate for him. Again and again as we read his collection we feel
that he is the last of the pre-Raphaelites, clothing genuine feelings in a faded vesture,
and images and words gone stale. He has improved. His earliest poems might well have
been left out; his latest include several sonnets (notably that beginning "I have been profligate
of happiness") which have been, and deserve to be, in the anthologies. But the last
exactitude of statement he seldom, as yet, has achieved; and his feelings about persons
come out much more strongly and convincingly than his feelings about Nature or the
eternal. This edition has a portrait.</p>

<h4 class="left">FORGOTTEN PLACES. By <span class="smcap">Ian Mackenzie</span>. Chapman &amp; Hall. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>In the last four years many young men have died who would have helped to make our
age&mdash;as it will in any case be&mdash;glorious in song. Brooke and Flecker and Edward
Thomas had at least partly expressed themselves; others, such as Wyndham Tennant
and Julian Grenfell, had written one or two perfect poems and justified the muse; but
there were some, whose talents only their friends knew, who might have ranked with
the first of these, and died before they had outgrown their boyhood. Ian Mackenzie was
one of these. He was in the H.L.I.; had a breakdown in England (he had outgrown his
strength) and died of pneumonia on Armistice night, after hearing that peace had come.
He was just twenty.</p>

<p>The present volume (his second) gathers up what was left over from his first, and is
prefaced by a memoir by Arthur Waugh, every word of which will be echoed by those
who knew Mackenzie, one of the handsomest, sunniest, most candid boys in the world.
He was twenty; and as yet too young to hammer into form the large visions of his
precocious imagination, and the queer thoughts that engaged his intellect. The reader
who knew him will see in every line the promise of a great maturity; the reader who did
not know him will probably fail to see more than a tumble of confused thoughts and
images obscurely worded in rhythms that are often ungainly. But even he may be
arrested here and there by a phrase beyond the common range of eighteen or nineteen.
There are several such in <i>Eyes</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eyes swim out like strange blue fishes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recovering beauty from the dark.<br /></span>

<p class="in0">And several also in the poem which arises out of the childlike reflection:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What a strange marvel is the telephone.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The whole of the second section of <i>Friends</i> is clear and passionate, and there are
lines at the beginning in which he makes the comparison of a thinker with a child
looking at pebbles in a pool, which are of the last simplicity and completeness. He
oscillated between an extreme analytical habit and a profound love for ordinary things.
The first mood may be illustrated by his strange poem on Words:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I watch you talking, catching mouthfuls of air,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which you twist around till you throw them out<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some are round and soft or dimpled and thin,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
<span class="i2">Some writhe and quiver fantastic about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some slip through the lips, and turn whispering in,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till the waves of silence shut them out.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, if we could not hear any sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But could see air moving like waves in a pond,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the shape of every word had been found<br /></span>

<p class="in0">The other is naïvely expressed in his phrase:</p>

<p>Col. Hardyman was a young civilian soldier who believed in peace, was on the
committee of the Union of Democratic Control, and died at twenty-three at the head
of his regiment. "I have never seen or heard of a man," says Mr. N. H. Romanes, in
his introduction, "to whom not merely a lie, even a harmless one, but any kind of
misrepresentation, was so abhorrent." He wrote his own epitaph thus: "He died as he
lived, fighting for abstract principles in a cause which he did not believe in." The verse
of the man described here cannot but be interesting. But it would be an affectation to
call it poetry. Genuine feeling often comes through, but in an amateur way. The nearest
thing to good poetry in the book is <i>Via Crucis</i>, which begins:</p>

<p>Mr. Legge has long been known as one of the most competent and comprehensive of
the many who in our time have tried their hands on the Epigrams of the Greek
Anthology. This selection is based on that given in Mr. Mackail's excellent little book.
Mr. Legge says that many of his versions were made on the top of a municipal tram.
He must be a self-possessed man. He never touches the level of inspiration reached in
Lang's or in Shelley's few translations from the Anthology, but no translator, so far
as we know, has done so many so well. He is always smooth, neat, perspicuous; his
principal lack is music. He gives what is perhaps the best extant version of the
epitaph on the dead of Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>The literary arena of England is at this moment strewn with the forms of discouraged
novelists who were hailed as coming great men and who have never yet been able to
make any adequate reply to the hail. The arrival of Mr. Conrad, Mr. Wells, and Mr.
Bennett, as writers concerning whom, in whatever tenor, our questions are answered,
is within recent memory. Soon after that event a new generation rose. Henry James
stooped from Olympus to examine them; and there was a good deal of excitement
abroad as to their future performance. But where are they now? Mr. Walpole's latest
book carries the history of a child up to his first departure from school. Mr. Compton
Mackenzie shows us a popular dramatist struggling for life in the midst of a farcical
crowd of relations. Mr. Swinnerton produces punctually one book a year in time for
the autumn publishing season. But meanwhile what is happening to the English novel?
Is anything happening to it?</p>

<p>It is certainly true that there is no perceptible curve of development or change.
There are fashions. Two of the books before us illustrate one of the most popular of
them, a fashion begun and now abandoned by Mr. Mackenzie. Mr. Walpole pushes
the novel of adolescence to its extreme, or beyond the extreme, by the tender age at
which he takes his hero. Mr. Brett Young goes through with it in conventional fashion,
conducting Edwin Ingleby from early years at school to his final medical examination
and the beginning of life. Mr. Walpole's <i>Jeremy</i> is a very faithful and exact record,
and yet it is not easy to say why he should have written it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mary, however, was there, and in the very middle of her game, searching for him, as she
was always doing, she found him desolate under the shadow of the oak. She slipped away,
and, coming up to him with the shyness and fear that she always had when she approached
him, because she loved him so much and he could so easily hurt her, said:</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming to play, Jeremy?"</p>

<p>"I don't care," he answered gruffly.</p>

<p>"It isn't any fun without you." She paused and added: "Would you mind if I stayed here
too?"</p>

<p>"I'd rather you played," he said; and yet he was comforted by her, determined, as he was,
that she should never know it!</p>

<p>"I'd rather stay," she said, and then gazed with that melancholy stare through her large
spectacles, that always irritated Jeremy, out across the garden.</p>

<p>"I'm all right," he said again; "only my stocking tickles, and I can't get at it&mdash;it's the
back of my leg. I say, Mary, don't you hate the Dean's Ernest?"</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">A not too exigent reader might still fail to be surprised or delighted by that passage or
by a hundred like it, and of such passages the book is made up. If Mr. Walpole continues
the child's career on the same scale his followers will groan; and yet perhaps as Jeremy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
grew older he might grow more interesting. For it is unlikely that, except in rare cases,
a grown man will remember enough of childhood to make the material of a long novel.
And the character of even the most remarkable child is not, after all, sufficiently broad,
sufficiently varied, to bear the weight of this exhaustive description.</p>

<p>Mr. Brett Young's less unusual design gives him better opportunities for the use
of his talent, but not often the opportunities his talent deserves. He came into notice
a little later than that younger generation which we have mentioned, and in some ways
his gifts are superior to those of any novelist of his own age. But it is a matter for doubt
whether they are strictly the gifts of a novelist. In the row of his books, all sincere, all
well written, all with obvious merits, the best is undeniably his account of the East
African Campaign, <i>Marching on Tanga</i>, the second his collection of poems, <i>Five Degrees
South</i>. In these two, landscape and his delight in it had an uncontested supremacy. In
his novels up to now that supremacy has been contested by the characters, who have,
however, faded away in the end against the background like puffs of smoke. This
certainly allowed the author's best talent to be displayed at advantage, and yet it is a
doubtful recommendation of a novel to say that the persons in it can hardly be noticed.</p>

<p>In <i>The Young Physician</i> the persons are not so unobtrusive, and the hero, if we had
not been aware of him before, would have forced himself on our attention by committing
manslaughter in the last pages of the book. He does, however, live and move before
that, and the characters around him at home, at school, at the university where he
studies medicine, are living and moving human beings. But the more clearly we see
Edwin and his surroundings the less, very unfortunately, we see of those poetical
qualities to which we have grown accustomed in Mr. Brett Young. Certain of the human
relations are indeed very well drawn. Edwin's love for his mother and his grief at her
death make moving passages. The episode in which he is drawn closer to his lonely
father is excellently done. But the second part of the book, where Mr. Brett Young
voluntarily confines himself in North Bromwich, is not, on the whole, a distinguished
piece of work. Here the author is without his hills, trees, and clouds, and is compelled
to exert himself in the observation and delineation of character. But though he does
his work here cleanly and honestly, as we have a right to expect from him, he does
it lifelessly and without enthusiasm. "W. G.," Boyce, even Rosie Beaucaire are alive
and credible, but it is hard for the reader not to suspect that Mr. Brett Young takes but
little interest in them and impossible, with that suspicion in his mind, to take much
interest in them himself. Much the best part of the book is the description of the journey
made by Edwin and his father to the deserted mining village in the Mendips, which
had been the father's home. Here Mr. Brett Young has his opportunity for description
and uses it well in a dozen passages.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>And, from a final crest, the road suddenly fell steeply through the scattered buildings of
a hamlet. An inn, with a wide space for carts to turn in, stood on a sort of platform at the
right-hand side of the highway, and in front of the travellers lay the mass of Mendip: the
black bow of Axdown with its shaggy flanks, the level cliffs of Callow, and a bold seaward
spur, so lost in watery vapours that it might well have claimed its ancient continuity with
the islands that swam beyond in the grey sea. In the light of his new enthusiasms Edwin
found it more impressive than any scene that he remembered; more inspiring, though
less vast in its perspective, than the dreamy plain of the Severn's upper waters that he had
seen so many times from Uffdown. For these hills were very mountains, and mightier in
that they rose sheer from a plain that had been bathed in water within the memory of man.
And more than all this ... far more ... they were the home of his fathers.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This quotation does not indicate, a dozen such could not exhaust, the grace and charm
of the episode in the Mendips. Here, perhaps, for a moment in the midst of an unsatisfactory
book Mr. Brett Young has attained a higher level of achievement than ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
before. His persons do not here fade into the landscape, but rather blend with it into
one picture, of which they are as essential a part as the hills and clouds. There is still,
it must be confessed, a certain lack of vigour in the presentation, but if the author
could compose a whole book in this manner it would be a very fine and remarkable
performance. Perhaps he may still do so. It would be very rash to decide at this moment
that the novel is not the form of art which he ought to pursue. But even if we reserve
judgment on this point, there can be no doubt that the scheme of <i>The Young Physician</i>
is in any case not well adapted to his particular gifts.</p>

<p>Mr. Compton Mackenzie, however, who invented and popularised this kind of novel,
has, in his latest production, thought fit to drop it. It was indeed desirable, after the
unfortunate affair of <i>Sylvia and Michael</i>, that he should attempt to break new ground;
but we think that many of his admirers will read <i>Poor Relations</i> in a mood of pleasure
mingled with dismay. One critic observed of <i>Guy and Pauline</i> that the future of the
English novel was, to a quite considerable extent, in Mr. Mackenzie's hands. But
the future of the English novel does not really lie in the direction of rattling books for
railway journeys, where humour is derived from cows, comic clergymen, and an
overwhelming hair-wash. Those who fixed Mr. Mackenzie with solemn expressions
of expectation on the ground of <i>Carnival</i> and <i>Sinister Street</i> will probably be hard
put to it to know what to make of this romping and boisterous piece of work. It
contains little more of what the author has been praised for than his vitality&mdash;which
was much diminished in <i>Sylvia and Michael</i>&mdash;and his verbal ingenuity. But it does
show high spirits and an eye not blind to those obvious humorous effects, such as
bad wine, mischievous and inquisitive children, the nervous author with his secretary,
and so forth, which when they are whole-heartedly embraced are, after all, still
humorous. If the future of the English novel really is in Mr. Mackenzie's hands and
if he continues in his present mood, the English novel is going to have a queer time
of it. But if he has done nothing else, he has proved himself free of priggishness.</p>

<p>Among these novelists only two, Mr. Swinnerton and Mr. Lynch, much concern
themselves with what was once an urgent topic of conversation, with the business,
namely, of giving the novel shape and compactness. This, it was at one time announced,
was the direction in which English fiction was moving, and perhaps it is still the most
significant movement, though it is accidentally a little veiled at present. But Mr.
Swinnerton, who is a novelist pure and simple, who follows no extravagant theory,
has no doctrinaire axe to grind, seems bent on making shipwreck of his powers. Some
novels can be written, as was <i>Mademoiselle de Maupin</i>, in six weeks. But Mr. Swinnerton
has not yet written a novel like <i>Mademoiselle de Maupin</i>, nor does it appear probable
that he will do so. He seems to have fallen into the habit of producing a cross between
a good book and "the commercial article" in good time for the autumn publishing
season once a year. Thus are the hopes raised by <i>Nocturne</i> disappointed; and those
who were disconcerted but cheerful last year under the stroke administered by <i>Shops
and Houses</i> will possibly falter in despair this year under the more poignant blow of
<i>September</i>. It is the theme of a beautiful woman, whose placid life does not flower into
passion until she is nearing middle age. Cherry Mant, who hardly hurts Marian Forster
by tampering with the affections of her good fellow of a husband, wounds her deeply
by making off with her youthful lover, Nigel Sinclair; and both acts of rapine are
cleverly introduced by a silly joke about the name of a brand of cigarettes. It is true:
Mr. Swinnerton knows his business. And if he has not the final fusing fire of genius, he
has talent in great quantities, experience, and knowledge and cleverness. He has learnt
his art, but rather than apply his learning he gives us once a year the irritating phantom
of a good book. His theme and his conception of its treatment are excellent. But he
will not pursue sufficiently deeply his researches into character, and unless he can
resign himself to missing the season now and again, he will be lost to the English novel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
His is not one of those talents that shine in rash and careless brilliance. It requires
intensive labour to make the best of it.</p>

<p>The same judgment applies with equal force to Mr. Lynch's talent. The difference
between him and Mr. Swinnerton is that he has taken the trouble to make the best
he can of his theme, which is exiguous and yet sufficient. The story turns on Jimmy
Guise's gradual discovery of his wife's worthlessness; and the hasty reader might
complain that in a short book Mr. Lynch has spent a great deal of time over a very
small matter. But those who range through contemporary fiction, anxious to be hopeful,
will be more interested in the care which he has spent on every facet of the tale. The
device, by which Jimmy is at once presented, full length and in detail, to the reader,
while Blanche is gradually discovered, is one of those solid and sufficient inventions
which immediately command respect. The exact and measured discovery of her worthlessness
takes place by slow, inexorable degrees which show that the author has never
once relaxed his vigilance over his composition. There are, it is true, irrelevancies even
in so short a work. Jessie Carruthers was not really necessary as a foil to Blanche.
The "New Department," though it is deliciously sketched, takes too prominent a
place. But these irrelevancies do not noticeably distort the general scheme, and are
in fact probably the result of Mr. Lynch's unconscious recognition that his plot was
a little too slender for even so brief a novel. But, in spite of this initial difficulty, <i>The
Tender Conscience</i> is a very creditable and satisfactory performance and gives grounds
for looking forward with much interest to Mr. Lynch's future development.</p>

<p>The novels of Mr. Gilbert Cannan and Mr. Stephen Hudson are of the sort in which
an attempt is made to simulate distinction by gratuitous eccentricity. Some painters, in
order to improve the landscapes with which nature has provided them, screw up their
eyes until the scene before them runs into a confused blur. Mr. Cannan and Mr.
Hudson make this grimace before the spectacle of life. It is a fashion like another,
but it has less usefulness and, we imagine, less durability than the novel of adolescence.</p>

<p>Mr. Cannan's book contains a gentleman named Perekatov with a "massive Jewish
face, thick, sensitive lips, a heavy blue chin, and tragic, short-sighted eyes," another
gentleman named Stephen Lawrie, whose characteristics are not so obvious, and a
young lady named Valérie du Toit, who appears to be the incarnation of all that Mr.
Cannan considers glorious. The thesis of the story, so far as we have been able to
discern it in the gyrations of these and other characters, is that the true England was
not in the war, but sat unheeded, forgotten, alone, in a little garret until the fighting
was over. Mr. Cannan is plainly dissatisfied about something, but he lacks a brain
sufficiently clear to make the reader understand what it is or what he wishes done.
Meanwhile he creates unreal scenes of physical and mental misery and squalor through
which the stoutest hearted could not drag themselves unyawning or undepressed. Their
yawns and their depression are, it is true, in some sort a tribute to Mr. Cannan's powers.
He creates these scenes with a certain vigour and finish, but his qualities will be for
ever wasted unless he can raise himself out of his present state of aimless gloom.</p>

<p>Mr. Hudson, perhaps even more than Mr. Cannan, has forgotten the limitations
imposed on him by his material, which is life. In this story of Richard Kurt, his shallow
and philandering wife, Elinor, and his crafty young mistress, Virginia, he seems to
suppose that nothing more than his bare word is needed to carry off impossible events
and unnatural psychology. But the novelist's task is not so easy as this. He cannot
secure originality by willing it or by producing an unexpected situation out of the void.
The unusual situation must be justified, not only by itself, but by all that has preceded
it. The novel effect which is obtained by suddenly altering a character already defined
is below childishness. As for the rest, this is a tale of the idle and indigent rich and
their experiments in adultery. Richard Kurt appears to be a perfectly worthless person,
so irritating in his sins and weaknesses, that it is easy to understand the feelings of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
disagreeable father and his frivolous, selfish, restless wife. Virginia, unfortunately, does
not in a strict sense, exist. The maiden, whose one desire it is to be seduced without
appearing to consent or even to be aware of the incident, may live somewhere in the
case-books of the pathologists; but Mr. Hudson has not delivered her from that prison-house.
He tells us that such was her behaviour and such her motives, but the reader
involuntarily declines to accept the assertion. Nor is it likely that the reader would
much care if it were true.</p>

<h4 class="left">OVER AND ABOVE. By <span class="smcap">J. E. Gurdon</span>. Collins. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This is a curiously naïve and artless story of the adventures of an airman, as seen
through the eyes of one Warton, whom we meet crossing to France for the first time and
leave going back to England on transfer to home service, with a Military Cross and two
bars. It is written with evident knowledge and covers most of the typical incidents
in an airman's life at the front. It is written, too, with complete sincerity, and it is easy
to discern the author's personality behind the speeches of his characters and his own
asides. Yet for all this it is hardly a success, hardly so convincing or informing as a
number of books that have been built on a much slighter foundation of first-hand
knowledge. The fights described are not clear or lucid, the persons introduced never
become real. All this goes to show that both some natural gift for, and some practice
in, literary composition are necessary for any book as well as experience of the life it
depicts.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE NEW DECAMERON. By <span class="smcap">Various Authors</span>. Blackwell. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p><i>The New Decameron</i> is a fascinating title which covers a disappointing book. The
greatness of the original Decameron springs, after all, in the first place from the extraordinary
beauty of the introduction, which sets the reader in a proper state of mind
for the stories that follow and which lingers with him ever afterwards if he reads a
story here and there at random. But the state of mind produced by the setting here,
in which a miscellaneous collection of rather disagreeable persons is becalmed in mid-Channel
in an excursion steamer, by no means recalls the magic of the Tuscan garden.
The stories vary greatly in quality, but none of them is entitled to be considered
very seriously. The best would make pleasant patches in our magazines, and the worst
would be bad anywhere. The jokes at the expense of German dullness in the "Professor's
Tale" are made with neatness and point. <i>The Stone House Affair</i> is not a
bad detective story. <i>The Upper Room</i> is a decadent effort of a somewhat antiquated
kind, but it is not too ill-written. There is no reason why these stories should not have
been both written and published. But the great name under which they are announced
and the elaboration of their frame make them seem perhaps more insignificant than
they really are.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE REVOLT OF YOUTH. By <span class="smcap">Coralie Hobson</span>. Werner Laurie. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The squalors of theatrical touring companies seem to be, and no doubt are, capable
of indefinite exploitation by novelists. Readers who care to be mildly harrowed by these
topics will find in this volume all the pabulum to which they have been accustomed
in innumerable other books. But those who have no particular taste for this sort of
thing beyond moderation will confine themselves to wondering in what the revolt
of youth here consists and in what way they are expected to find it a moving performance.
Louie breaks away from home, goes on the stage, is a failure, returns and marries her
cousin. There is a suicide and a good deal of illicit love-making, and at the end the
heroine behaves with conventionally noble unconventionality. But these things are
wearisome if one has no special taste for them.</p>

<h3>BELLES-LETTRES AND CRITICISM</h3>

<h4 class="left">SOME DIVERSIONS OF A MAN OF LETTERS. By <span class="smcap">Edmund Gosse</span>, C.B.
Heinemann. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Diversions? In a sense they are all, they have always been, diversions.
Mr. Gosse has never allowed the chains of the critical vocation to weigh
heavily upon him. It has been consistently his especial characteristic that he has
approached the most difficult problems in literature with undaunted courage and
vivacity. Where others have sat down to the difficult siege of Donne or Swinburne
with the pedantic long faces of writers determined not to flinch even though all their
readers fall asleep during the fray, Mr. Gosse advances lightly, blows a pleasant blast
on the trumpet of his familiar prose and topples the most obdurate walls over before
him, without ever losing the least part of his dignity. This it is which makes his reputation
one of the assets of modern English literature. He represents among us a school of
critics of which the disciples in this country are by no means too numerous. During
a long career he has found and continually practised the secret of being almost always
sound and never dull, invariably vivacious, and hardly ever superficial. His critical
essays have always the gay, untrammelled air, if not the frivolous substance, of pure
diversions.</p>

<p>In his new collection he ranges among a variety of subjects and takes now a well-worn
road, now a path that has tempted few enquirers. <i>The Songs of Shakespeare</i> is not
precisely a subject to attract the dealer in literary fireworks. It is, on the other hand,
a subject ripe for the most portentous, the most meaningless, the most tedious
aberrations of the pedant. Yet how delicately does Mr. Gosse, in no more than five
pages, steer between these extremes and plant the arrow of his comment exactly on
the necessary spot! Benjamin Disraeli, in his capacity as novelist, makes a theme not
much less forbidding to the critic who doubts his own ability to be original. But Mr.
Gosse is, with justice, serenely confident in the power of his style to overcome this
difficulty. There is perhaps little in this essay which has not been both perceived
and expressed before. But it is Mr. Gosse who crystallises mature opinion on the novels
of Disraeli in a passage which might be taken as a model of discrimination and style
or critical prose:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Disraeli began his career, as I have pointed out in the earlier part of this essay, as a
purveyor of entertainment to the public in a popular and not very dignified kind. He
contended with the crowd of fashionable novelists whose books consoled the leisure of
Mrs. Wititterly as she reclined on the drawing-room sofa. He found rivals in Bulwer and
Mrs. Gore, and a master in Plumer Ward. His brilliant stories sold, but at first they won
him little advantage. Slowly, by dint of his inherent force of genius, his books have not
merely survived their innumerable fellows, but they have come to represent to us the form
and character of a whole school; nay, more, they have come to take the place in our memories
of a school which, but for them, would have utterly passed away and been forgotten.
Disraeli, accordingly, is unique, not merely because his are the only fashionable novels of the
pre-Victorian era which anyone ever reads nowadays, but because in his person that
ineffable manner of the "thirties" reaches an isolated sublimity and finds a permanent
place in literature. But if we take a still wider view of the literary career of Disraeli, we are
bound to perceive that the real source of the interest which his brilliant books continue to
possess is the evidence their pages reveal of the astonishing personal genius of the man.
Do what we will, we find ourselves looking beyond Contarini Fleming and Sidonia and
Vivian Grey to the adventurous Jew who, by dint of infinite resolution and an energy which
never slept, conquered all the prejudices of convention, and trod English society beneath
his foot in the triumphant irony of success. It is the living Disraeli who is always more
salient than the most fascinating of his printed pages.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
We have chosen this passage, not because it is the most remarkable in the book, but
almost at random, and in preference to some which are more brilliant and more highly
wrought. But it is a fair example not only of the grace, but also of the precision, with
which Mr. Gosse habitually uses his pen. His <i>Three Experiments in Portraiture</i> are specimens
of the same skill in delineation with the added advantage that the author knew
his subjects directly. This is an art in which he has always excelled. His slighter, and
his more elaborate, portraits of Swinburne stand easily among the first things of the
kind in our language; and though perhaps Lady Dorothy Nevill, Lord Cromer, and Lord
Redesdale did not offer material so variegated or so unusual, it may be for that reason
that Mr. Gosse's portraits of them are even more interesting as studies by a virtuoso.
When we come again to pure criticism, we find in <i>The Message of the Wartons</i>, a lecture
delivered before the British Academy, the same graceful and distinguished gesture
with which Mr. Gosse points to the interesting and useful traits to be discerned in his
subject. Mr. Gosse will never be a true or a factitious fanatic elevating some spark
of genius in a neglected worthy above the true fire discovered in others by the just sense
of mankind. He makes no exaggerated claim for the Wartons, but he does see in them
what has not been sufficiently insisted on before.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>They struggled for a little while, and then they succumbed to the worn verbiage of their
age, from which it is sometimes no light task to disengage their thought. In their later
days they made some sad defections, and I can never forgive Thomas Warton for arriving
at Marlowe's <i>Hero and Leander</i> and failing to observe its beauties. We are told that as
Camden Professor he "suffered the rostrum to grow cold," and he was an ineffective Poet
Laureate. His brother Joseph felt the necessity or the craving for lyrical expression, without
attaining more than a muffled and a second-rate effect.</p>

<p>All this has to be sadly admitted. But the fact remains that between 1740 and 1750, while
even the voice of Rousseau had not begun to make itself heard in Europe, the Wartons
had discovered the fallacy of the poetic theories admitted in their day, and had formed some
faint conception of a mode of escape from them. The Abbé Du Bos had laid down in his
celebrated <i>Réflexions</i> (1719) that the poet's art consists of making a general moral representation
of incidents and scenes, and embellishing it with elegant images. This had been accepted
and acted upon by Pope and all his followers. To have been the first to perceive the
inadequacy and the falsity of a law which excluded all imagination, all enthusiasm, and all
mystery, is to demand respectful attention from the historian of Romanticism, and this
attention is due to Joseph and Thomas Warton.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">They had a faint conception: they demand respectful attention. These are indeed the
accents of moderation, but then, as Mr. Gosse knows, to praise the Wartons with
enthusiasm would be unjust. It is the centre of his critical talent that he is always
moderate and precise in his estimates, and this fact gives his commendation more value,
his blame more weight, and makes his judgments more readily acceptable.</p>

<p>It is possible to bring forward charges against Mr. Gosse. The two essays in this
book on contemporary literature, <i>Some Soldier Poets</i> and <i>The Future of English Poetry</i>,
suggest that, at least when they were written, the author was not fully acquainted with
the buds of the new spring. The opinions expressed in them are, within the limits of
his apparent knowledge, equally acceptable to both older and younger critics; but
these limits are somewhat narrower than they might have been. But it would be ungracious,
as well as disproportionate, to make much of this point. What is important
is that Mr. Gosse is a veteran of English criticism, who has enriched our literature
with a body of work which has no parallel and whose powers show no signs of flagging.
When we consider his latest, we involuntarily turn our eyes back to his earlier books,
and we cannot resist the conclusion that he has rendered to English letters a very
remarkable service indeed. The latest is a continuation of the earliest, and this is, after
all, the most important thing which can be said of it.</p>

<h4 class="left">A CRITIC IN PALL MALL. By <span class="smcap">Oscar Wilde</span>. Methuen. 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This volume appears, rather regrettably, with no indication of how it came into
existence, how Wilde wrote the essays of which it is composed or who chose them for
republication and on what principle. But the references given at the heads of the essays
show that they are reviews collected from the <i>Woman's World</i>, the <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>,
and other papers. Wilde did not gather them together nor, so far as we know, even
contemplate such a book. It is probable that he would be a little dismayed by it if he
could see it.</p>

<p>In some of these pieces there occur phrases and judgments which are the genuine
Wilde at his best, witty and well turned if not always wise. There is, for example, a
pleasing pertness in his remark on dialect poetry:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To say "mither" instead of "mother" seems to many the acme of romance. There are
others who are not quite so ready to believe in the pathos of provincialism.</p></blockquote>

<p>There is a long essay on Lefébvre's <i>Embroidery and Lace</i> which is very characteristic,
and has, we think, been quoted before. There is a short essay on <i>Dinners and Dishes</i>,
from which the following passage may be extracted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There is a great field for the philosophic epicure in the United States. Boston beans may
be dismissed at once as delusions, but soft-shell crabs, terrapin, canvas-back ducks, blue
fish, and the pompons of New Orleans are all wonderful delicacies, particularly when one
gets them at Delmonico's. Indeed, the two most remarkable bits of scenery in the States are
undoubtedly Delmonico's and the Yosemite Valley, and the former place has done more
to promote a good feeling between England and America than anything else has in this
century.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">These are worth having, if Wilde is worth having at all, because they are characteristic.
There would have been no great occasion for weeping if they had been lost or if they
had never been clipped from the papers in which they appeared. But since someone
has had the industry to collect them, and since there is a sufficient demand to warrant
their issue in volume form, we may receive them with a moderate pleasure.</p>

<p>The greater part of the volume, however, does not rise to this level. Even the most
brilliant and versatile of writers cannot consistently display his individual powers in
journeyman work; and Wilde, though his wit was irrepressible, almost involuntary,
was no more conscientious than any other reviewer. When the good sentences came
they came: when they did not, he made no particular effort to maintain either his style
or his ideas on any very elevated plane. There is no great value for the reader of to-day
in a picture of Mrs. Somerville in a review of a book on her by a Miss Phyllis Browne.
And no reader is likely to take a very vivid delight in Wilde's comment on a book called
<i>How to be Happy though Married</i>, that</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Most young married people nowadays start in life with a dreadful collection of ormolu
inkstands covered with sham onyxes, or with a perfect museum of salt-cellars. We strongly
recommend this book as one of the best of wedding presents</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">or in the jokes that Wilde quotes from the book. Unfortunately it is by no means clear
that the anonymous compiler has realised how much uninteresting matter he is
reprinting. He closes the volume with twenty-odd pages of <i>Sententiæ</i>, selected from
reviews in which the gems of thought and language were detachably scattered. But
these gems include such remarks as "No one survives being over-estimated," and
"No age ever borrows the slang of its predecessor." We cannot therefore excuse him
on the ground that he knew he was dragging lumber into the light, and did so from a
pious if mistaken motive.</p>

<h4 class="left">CONTEMPORARIES OF SHAKESPEARE. By <span class="smcap">Algernon Charles Swinburne</span>.
Heinemann. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<h4 class="left">THE PROBLEM OF HAMLET. By the <span class="smcap">Rt. Hon. J. M. Robertson</span>. Allen &amp;
Unwin. 5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Swinburne's book, as Mr. Gosse explains in his introduction, is the complement of his
work <i>The Age of Shakespeare</i>. He had intended a comprehensive survey of the whole
of the Elizabethan drama, the glories of which he spent a great part of his life in
celebrating. He did enough of it to show what the complete work would have been;
the outlines are all here, but they are only filled in patches.</p>

<p>That, carrying on as he did the Lamb tradition, and expressing it in his own language,
he was sometimes over-enthusiastic, every reader of his sonnet on Tourneur knows.
That he was liable to say incompatible things on different pages, where his purposes
were different, is also common knowledge. We do not go to him for an exact "placing"
of men or for temperate statement; it might be roughly said that he was willing
to regard any minor Elizabethan writer as a master, unless he desired to use him to
point a contrast with someone else, in which event the unfortunate playwright might
be treated as a buffoon, an incompetent, and an impostor. Yet even of just and balanced
criticism there is much in this book. No critic before him has so acutely dissociated the
great Marlowe from the Greenes, Peeles, and Lodges, who are indolently classed with
him. (It is characteristic that in making this dissociation he says of one of Peele's plays
that it is "a riddle beyond and also beneath solution" how a man of any capacity
could have "dropped upon the nascent stage an abortion so monstrous in its spiritless
and shapeless misery as his villainous play of <i>Edward I</i>.") And the essay on Chapman,
here reprinted, is one of the finest panegyrics and most illuminating pieces of imaginative
criticism in the language. He may, when he turns his searchlight on little men,
illumine them too much; but Chapman was not a little man, and with space to move in
and time to think in Swinburne here produced a masterpiece. The long passage
on Browning and his obscurity is almost as good, so good that a digression, otherwise
unpardonable, is self-excused.</p>

<p>The book as a whole is among Swinburne's best prose books. His writing is what
it ever was. Almost every word and sentence is duplicated. He would write: "No
man and no woman who has ever ridden on a bus or driven on a cab down the quiet
bye-streets and crowded thoroughfares of Paris or of London could fail to have noticed
with interest and to have condemned, or at least deprecated, without hesitation or
afterthought, the design of the posters displayed on the hoardings or exhibited in the
windows, even as, with no greater hesitation and no less microscopic afterthought,
he would have," &amp;c., &amp;c. We feel that the sentences might have been split into halves
and two books of precisely similar meaning made out of the one. Yet his manner is
a part of him. Even his most serpentine sentences have vigour and directness when
they are read aloud; and his invective is as entertaining as ever. Swinburne had a very
small vocabulary as a poet, but a very large one as a writer of denunciatory prose. He
refers to a play of James Howard's as "a piece of noisome nonsense which must make
his name a stench in the nostrils of the nauseated reader," and through a series of
"laughing jackasses," "howling dervishes," and things ignoble, impure, infamous,
and abominable he reaches the climax of his abuse with the beautiful appellation,
"verminous pseudonymuncule."</p>

<p>Mr. Robertson also has planned a large work on the drama, but his is restricted
to Shakespeare. He proposes to complete a series, of which his <i>Shakespeare and
Chapman</i> was an instalment, on "the canon of Shakespeare." He has more concentration
and more industry than Swinburne, and he may complete his task. He is not
an inspired critic and, unlike Swinburne's, his manner does not contribute to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
readableness of his books. He is often&mdash;though an engagingly acrimonious controversialist&mdash;heavy-footed;
and he has a passion for words like "theorem" and
"confutation" which is almost incomprehensible in a man who obviously loves the
simplest and most beautiful art. In the present volume he tackles the problem of
Hamlet. He ridicules those who think that Hamlet was very vacillating; who would
not be upset if he discovered that his father had been murdered by his uncle and his
mother, and who would not hesitate before killing a man on the word of a ghost?
But he admits, as we all must admit, that there are inconsistencies in the play, and he
argues, with what we think conclusive force, that these are derived from Kyd's lost
<i>Hamlet</i>, which Shakespeare used as a basis. Here, as elsewhere (in <i>Othello</i> and <i>The
Merchant of Venice</i> for example), Shakespeare was handicapped by his sources. Mr.
Robertson sometimes pushes his arguments too far, and he exaggerates, we think (where
he finds it convenient), the inexplicability of Hamlet's character. But he has spent
immense industry on the book, and it is a contribution to Shakespearean study that
no scholar will be able to ignore. We wish, by the way, that he would not spend so
much of his time, here and elsewhere, arguing with people, German and other, who
are not worth arguing with.</p>

<h4 class="left">APPRECIATIONS OF POETRY. By <span class="smcap">Lafcadio Hearn</span>. Heinemann. 15<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Hearn was a sensible critic. But it is a fact&mdash;and a pity&mdash;that his criticisms of English
literature were addressed to an audience of Japanese students. In examining a few
of them (and we have already had two immense volumes) we get some instruction and
entertainment from observing what he selects for Japan and how he explains it&mdash;a
comparison and a contrast of the Eastern and Western points of view. Here and there,
too, trying everything "on the dog," he reveals unexpected merits in English writers.
In the "Interpretations" he demonstrated not merely the worth of Longfellow, but
the intermittent genius of Mrs. Norton. But we can have too much of a rather interesting
thing, and it is inevitable that these lectures on Tennyson, Rossetti, Swinburne,
Browning, Matthew Arnold, Morris, and various minors should be too elementary,
however sound they may be, and however happy the quotations, to give serious English
readers much satisfaction. We note with pleasure that many years ago Hearn was
pointing out to Japan the great qualities of Robert Bridges as a poet of landscape.</p>

<h3>HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<h4 class="left">THE EXPANSION OF EUROPE (1415&ndash;1789): A History of the Foundations of
the Modern World. By <span class="smcap">W. C. Abbott</span>, Professor of History in Yale University.
Bell. Two vols. 30<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Every schoolboy, in the Macaulayan sense, has at some time or other determined to
write a history of the world in twenty volumes from the earliest times to the present
day. Achievement is fortunately given to few. Omniscience becomes yearly more
impossible, and, since the human mind can no longer single-handed cope with the
accumulations of human knowledge, in history, as in so many other things, we have
reached an age of intensive specialisation. These are truths which are continually being
impressed upon us by the schools of modern history, and that they are to a great extent
truths will be shown by a glance at any well-loaded shelf in a library devoted to the
output of the modern historian. Yet there is distinct evidence of a reaction against
this meticulous specialisation; there are signs that several most learned historians
are discarding the historical microscope for the historical telescope and are yielding
to the old fascination of writing histories of the world. The free airs of the New World<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
seem to encourage this new phase of an old fascination. It is not very long ago that
Professor Hayes of Columbia University took a large brush and a large canvas and
produced two excellent and impressive volumes which he called <i>A Political and Social
History of Modern Europe</i>. These two volumes were in effect a world history from
1500 to 1915. The mere thought of such a venture would produce a feeling of intellectual
vertigo in most historians of the old world. But now Professor Abbott of Yale
University comes along with two great volumes, and a promised third, in which he
approaches world history with an even larger canvas and larger brush. He tells us himself
that he is presenting us with "a new synthesis of modern history." We confess to as
profound a distrust of the word "synthesis" as some people have of the word
"definitive," and when a professor tells us that he has produced a new synthesis of
history we are inclined to believe that this is another way of admitting that Providence
has not granted him the gift of clear thinking or clear writing. But Professor Abbott's
preface does him and his book an injustice. Some doctors, if you go to them with a
swollen arm, will tell you that you have œdema of the arm; but there is no need to be
frightened&mdash;the doctor is only telling you, what you know already, that you have
a swollen arm. So, too, there is really no need to be frightened by the historian who
assures you that his book has a synthesis; he probably only means, what you know
already, that his book has a subject.</p>

<p>We have not discovered the synthesis in Mr. Abbott's 1000 pages, but we have
discovered that he has a very good subject and has written, in many respects, a very good
book. The book itself proves that he is well equipped with knowledge and has made
full use of the intensive and microscopic study of the modern historian. But he
approaches history from the standpoint of enthusiastic and large-minded youth. He
has thrown away his microscopes and determined to look back at history through a
telescope. Immediately a large and dominating fact has attracted his attention. The
age we live in is pre-eminently the European Age. The world is dominated by Europe
and Europeans: there have in the past been eras in which a race or races have by
migrations and conquests spread themselves and their civilisation and government
over wide spaces of the earth, but never before has there been so universal and permanent
a domination and expansion from one small quarter of the globe. Professor Abbott,
seizing his historical telescope, has looked back and tried to discover the origin, the
causes, and the courses of this amazing phenomenon. And the more one investigates
the phenomenon the more amazing it appears. Take the case of migrations. The
European Age or the modern world, as Professor Abbott has no difficulty in showing,
began in the fifteenth century. (In history, of course, there is really never any real
beginning or any real end; there are no abrupt transitions, only faster or slower currents
in the stream of change; nevertheless there are periods in which the movement quickens
so perceptibly that they are clearly turning-points in human history; and the fifteenth
century is undoubtedly such a turning-point.) Now one of the most striking facts in
the modern world has been the migration of Europeans. In North America, Northern
Asia, Australia, South Africa, and to some extent in South America we see the
Europeanisation of vast regions of the earth still being accomplished by the most ancient
form of migration and colonisation. At the same time Europe has sent out a continual
stream of conquerors and traders by whose efforts practically the whole of the rest
of the world, where the inhabitants were not exterminated, has been subjected to
European rule and the European's political and economic system. As Professor Abbott
points out, this was a complete reversal of the rôle of Europe and the European in
history. "Between the fall of the Roman Empire and the discovery of America Europe
had been rather the passive than the active element in that great shifting of population
to which we give the name of folk-wandering or migration." And it is a curious fact that
the new period of history, of the expansion of Europe, and of the modern world begins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
with an event&mdash;it is the event mentioned in the very first sentence of Professor
Abbott's book&mdash;which involved not the expansion but the most notable shrinking
and invasion of Europe and was characteristic of the old world. To the European of
1453 the fall of Constantinople before the victorious Turk seemed to portend one more
desperate and disastrous struggle against a horde of Asiatic invaders, and the inevitable
and universal blindness of contemporaries to the great movements and currents moulding
their destiny and history could not be better illustrated than by this fear and foreboding
of the European in 1453. Within a hundred years of the fall of Constantinople, instead
of Europe fighting desperately against the non-European world of invaders, the non-European
world was already engaged in a hopeless struggle against the swarm of
European invaders. In fact, however, the movement, which within a generation was
to send Portuguese and Spaniards ranging over Africa, Asia, and the New World, had
already begun in 1453. Contemporaries thought the end of a European world had
come with the capture of Constantinople; they should have seen that the fall of Ceuta to
the Portuguese prince in 1415 and the discovery and colonisation of the Madeiras in
1418 marked the beginning of a new European world of colonisation, conquest, and
territorial expansion.</p>

<p>It is the story of this expansion, this change from the mediæval to the modern world,
which Professor Abbott seeks to unfold in his two volumes. The estimation of his
success or failure raises an important question for the historian. He is clearly right in
his view that "a proper basis for the understanding of what has happened during the
past five hundred years" cannot be found merely in the history of territorial expansion.
If you look at the past through his historical telescope you soon see that you cannot
isolate the voyage of Columbus from the break up of the feudal system and mediæval
institutions, or the exploits of Hernando Cortez from those of Martin Luther. Consequently
Professor Abbott attempts, as he says in his preface, to combine three elements
into a narrative of European activities from 1415 to 1789. The three elements are
described by him as first "the connection of the social, economic, and intellectual
development of European peoples with their political affairs"; second, "the progress of
events among the peoples of Eastern Europe, and of the activities of Europeans beyond
the sea"; and third, "the relation of the past to the present&mdash;the way in which the
various factors of modern life came into the current of European thought and practice,
and how they developed into the forms with which we are familiar." The real question
for the critic of Professor Abbott's book is how far he has succeeded in this tremendous
undertaking. The undertaking is so tremendous and the attempt so gallant that we
hesitate to give an answer which is in fact so easy. With all its good points, its wide
learning, its scholarly arrangement, its great interest and enthusiasm, the book cannot
really be said to succeed in its chief aim. To judge from our personal experience, the
reader, when he is about a third of the way through the two volumes, begins to have an
uncomfortable sense of having lost his way, and this feeling gradually grows stronger
and stronger. The man who writes a history of the world which is not to be a mere
catalogue of facts, but is to illustrate and explain the present by the past and is to keep
us on the track of great world movements, has to select his facts, and it is mainly upon
his intuition for relevant facts and his skill in selection and presentation that the success
of his enterprise depends. Professor Abbott's failure to keep our vision clear and our
feet steadily upon the right path comes from a failure to select and an error in method.
His book as it proceeds tends to become more and more a catalogue of facts, divided
into chapters and labelled with such labels as "Europe beyond the Sea" and "Social
and Intellectual Europe"; the general theme which should connect these innumerable
facts becomes lost and forgotten, or at least no longer visible to or present in the consciousness
of the reader. The measure of this failure is the frequency with which
Professor Abbott makes the connection between his facts purely one of time, for it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
almost a confession of failure on the part of a world historian with a synthesis when he
has to point out to us that the summoning of the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg, the
conversion of John Calvin, and the conquest of Peru all happened in the same year.
Professor Abbott's mistake seems to us to consist largely in having overloaded his
book with detailed facts. As it stands it is invaluable as a mine of facts bearing upon
the change from mediævalism to modernity and upon Europe's conquest of the world;
but an immense number of these facts are irrelevant to his general theme and purpose.
Open the book at random and this immediately becomes apparent. Here is page 384
in a chapter called "The Rise of Holland," and on it we find ourselves immersed in
the details of the Thirty Years' War. Here Professor Abbott has failed to decide whether
he is writing a text-book of history in which the military exploits of the Margrave,
John George of Brandenburg-Jägerndorf are relevant, or a wide survey of the great
currents of history in which John George had but a microscopic place. Here the author
abandons his telescope and world history for the microscope and John George, with
the result that the feet of his reader wander from the path and his eyes are clouded.
It is fatal to attempt to use a telescope and a microscope at the same time on the same
object.</p>

<h4 class="left">BOCHE AND BOLSHEVIK. By <span class="smcap">Hereward T. Price</span>. Murray. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The author of this book was born an Englishman, but at the outbreak of war he was
living in Germany, a naturalised German. He was called up and served in the German
Army on the Eastern front, was taken prisoner, sent to Siberia, and was a witness of
the Russian revolution there. The book is a record of his personal experiences and
views. He is as bitterly hostile to his adopted country as he is to Bolshevism and
Bolsheviks. His book does not add very much to our knowledge of the war or the
revolution, and his own knowledge may be measured by the fact that he apparently
thinks that the "secret treaties" published by the Bolshevik Government were made
by Kerenski.</p>

<h4 class="left">TO KIEL IN THE "HERCULES." By <span class="smcap">Lewis R. Freeman</span>. Murray. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Freeman was Official Correspondent with the Grand Fleet, and he accompanied

record of the various inspections and of conditions in Germany immediately after the
armistice.</p>

<h4 class="left">MY KINGDOM FOR A HORSE! By <span class="smcap">William Allison</span>. Richards. 21<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>If he never sacrificed a kingdom, Mr. Allison at least abandoned a first-class in his
schools for the sake of horses. That day was, indeed, evidently the turning-point of his
life. He was an admirable writer of Latin verse, and when he was in for Moderations
at Oxford the Latin verse paper fell on the same day as the Derby. He left his composition
unwritten to go and see whether Prince Charlie had won the Derby. Mr. Allison,
with the modesty proper to heroes, now calls his action "extremely silly," but few
readers of this book of recollections will agree. Many men get firsts; few men pursue
horse-breeding and racing with the poetic fervour which Mr. Allison brought to them.
His recollections are of Rugby under Temple and Balliol under Jowett, and this part of
his book is an amusing mixture, recalling now <i>Tom Brown's Schooldays</i> (for Rugby
still kept the Arnold stamp) and now <i>Ruff's Guide</i>. When he left Balliol he was called
to the Bar, but never gave it undue preference over the paddock. He ran a famous
breeding establishment, and when the Stud Company Limited failed Mr. Allison<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
combined practice at the Bar with journalism. As editor of <i>St. Stephen's Review</i>, which
was started with £500 capital in 1883 and lasted till its famous conflict with the Hansard
Union in 1891, Mr. Allison deserves praise for one notable act&mdash;he discovered Phil May.
The cartoons of May's which he reproduces will not compare with the artist's later
drawings, but it is not possible to estimate the value to May of the training he obtained
in this early political work. The Fleet Street of the '80's, when Romano's was a place
the quieter journalist entered with trembling, is portrayed in a dry, matter-of-fact way
far more effective than any elaborate, highly-coloured description. There may be
people who are not interested in horses or journalism; to them we can recommend the
pleasant tributes to Bacchus which lace engagingly the more serious chronicle. As a
boy Mr. Allison was not strong, and a good old-fashioned doctor ordered him a glass
of port every morning at eleven; this "advice was followed scrupulously, both at home
and when I went to school," and Mr. Allison never actually says that he has abandoned
the prescribed dose.</p>

<p>Mr. Allison writes with no pretensions to literary art, and he sometimes chronicles
very trifling occurrences; but he has an engaging modesty and a genial "take it or
leave it" attitude which redeem his book from the charge of triviality. <i>My Kingdom
for a Horse!</i> should be invaluable to the historian of social manners and to the novelist
who is anxious to get material for the reconstruction of a time which already seems
historical. There are plenty of illustrations&mdash;mostly process reproductions of old
photographs and examples of Phil May's work. We wish, by the way, if Mr. Allison
owns the copyright, that he would persuade some publisher to issue a new and worthier
edition of May's <i>The Parson and the Painter</i>, which first appeared in the <i>St. Stephen's
Review</i>.</p>

<h3>POLITICS AND ECONOMICS</h3>

<h4 class="left">HOW THE WAR CAME. By the <span class="smcap">Earl Loreburn</span>. Methuen. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>There is very little disagreement to-day, we suppose, as to who were the prime authors
of the War. But on the minor question, whether any blame attaches to the Entente
Powers, opinion is, as it was from the beginning, far more divided. The controversy
as to our own position in the crisis, which had almost faded out of the public mind, is
sharply revived by Lord Loreburn's book. Lord Loreburn, let us hasten to say, does not
deny the guilt of Germany. Indeed, he is at pains to show how the Bismarckian tradition,
improved upon by chauvinistic professors, a more or less demented monarch and a
ruthless military caste, had sapped the morality of the German nation and made it
all too ready to follow its rulers into a deliberate attack on the peace of Europe. Nor
does he lend any support to the suggestion that the British Government or the British
people wanted war with Germany. He pays a tribute to the efforts made by the Foreign
Secretary to avert the disaster at the eleventh hour. And yet Viscount Grey cannot,
in his mind, escape a large share of responsibility for the final conflagration. For what
made the war inevitable, he asserts, was our entente with France. That entente was a
departure from the traditional British policy of holding aloof from all Continental
entanglements. It was developed by Sir Edward Grey, with the assistance of Mr.
Asquith and Lord Haldane, behind the backs of Parliament, and even of the Cabinet,
from the end of 1905 onwards. Not only was Sir Edward Grey working in secret;
he was committing this country to the support of France (and through France of
Russia) without taking the necessary steps to increase the army so as to make that
support effective. And, worst of all, he had nothing in black and white to define exactly
to what amount of support we were committed. The result was seen on
August 4th, 1914, when it became manifest that we were under an obligation of honour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
to join our arms with the French against Germany. Sir Edward Grey, of course, maintained
that we were not so bound, that we were free to decide whether to declare war
or not. And it is certain that a large part, if not the whole, of the nation, was convinced
that it was the attack on Belgium which did finally bring us in. But this, says Lord
Loreburn, was a delusion, which flowed from the arch-delusion of Sir Edward Grey
that our hands were free.</p>

<p>Lord Loreburn's case, it will be seen, clearly has two heads. He did not like the policy
of the French Entente, and he did not like the methods by which it was promoted.
On the first point most readers will disagree with him, and, in any event, the matter
is now of merely historic interest. On the second point, public opinion will be more
interested in his criticisms. Some will say that Lord Loreburn's old hostility to the
Liberal Imperialists inclines him to magnify the faults that were committed between
1905 and 1914. Some will say that he exaggerates the ignorance under which we are
alleged to have laboured in regard to our relations with France. His opponents will
certainly suggest that everybody knew where we stood, as towards France, and that
the secrecy was secrecy in name only. But these are not matters for discussion in
these columns. Lord Loreburn thinks that "the persistent danger of secret diplomacy
is hitherto tolerated and abused in this and other countries" is one that the
nations ought to lose no time in taking to heart.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE MASTERY OF THE FAR EAST. By <span class="smcap">A. J. Brown</span>. Bell. 25<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This massive volume (it runs to some 650 pages) is a very interesting account of the
Japanese and Korean peoples, their customs, their religions, their politics, and the
influence of Christian missions in their countries. Dr. Brown is an American with an
agreeable style, a sense of humour, and, in general, a nice critical faculty, and, though
we are very doubtful of some of his conclusions, we do not hesitate to say that his book
is a valuable contribution to the literature of the Far East.</p>

<p>From a political point of view the Far East means to-day&mdash;and it will mean more
and more in the future&mdash;Japan. Every schoolboy knows the story of Japan's rapid
emergence from feudalism to the position of a first-class modern Power, of her successful
struggles with China and Russia, of her mastery of the Korean peninsula, of the great
part she played in the late war. And schoolboys, as well as statesmen, may presently
watch the effects upon world politics of her status in Asia. Dr. Brown is a candid
friend of the Japanese. He is not under the illusion that they are a model people, nor is
he of those who describe them as "varnished savages." He comments severely on
the lamentable labour conditions that prevail under their newly-created industrial
system. He is no lover of the autocracy of their government. He does not deny the
faults of their diplomacy. Nevertheless he is their friend, who believes in them. He
expresses his sympathy with Korea and with China in their subjection. But he
takes what he calls "the large way" of viewing Japan's Korean policy. "The large
way," he says, "is to note that, in the evolution of the race and the development of the
plan of God, the time had come when it was for the best interests of the world and for
the welfare of the Koreans themselves that Korea should come under the tutelage of
Japan." As for China, she is "an enormous and backward country ... like a
ship without a captain or pilot, helplessly drifting on the high seas, apparently unable
to right herself and, in her present water-logged condition, a menace to other ships."
And so he sympathises "with the feeling of the Japanese that they cannot ignore this
incontestable situation." He is an enthusiastic believer in Christian missions, and
he hopes that Christianity will be the salvation of Japan. Japan's great need, he says,
is to be spiritualised. Neither Buddhism nor Shintoism have the necessary moral influence.
But Christian missions are a great reconstructive force&mdash;economical, social, intellectual,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
political, spiritual, international. What, then, is the position of Christianity in Japan?
Dr. Brown produces statistics to show that it has made enormous strides, and quotations
from Japanese statesmen and publicists as evidence that its growth is welcomed by the
rulers of the country. Yet all the public schools are forbidden to teach religion; Buddhism
has been driven to reform itself; Shintoism, as he admits, is a waxing rather than a
waning force. In another passage he says that the old religions of Japan are losing their
hold on the educated classes. Thus a recent census in the Imperial University of Tokio
showed fifty Buddhists, sixty Christians, 1500 atheists, 3000 agnostics. It would appear,
therefore, that the missionaries have a long row to hoe before Christianity becomes the
general religion of the Japanese.</p>

<h4 class="left">RACE AND NATIONALITY. By <span class="smcap">John Oakesmith</span>, D.Litt., M.A. Heinemann.
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>There is some chance, now that the heat and passion of the war are past, that the vexed
questions of nationality and nationalism will be discussed with a little more intelligence
and discrimination. Dr. Oakesmith certainly sets a good example. He tells us that he
was formerly one of those (they were the vast majority, we think) who had but a vague
idea of what they meant by nationality, till he set himself to study the question and
classify his mind. The results appear in this very interesting book. He criticises alike
the theory that nationality is based on "race," and the opposing theory that there is no
such thing as nationality at all. In his own view nationality develops as an evolutionary
process, and the full-grown thing may be defined as "organic continuity of common
interest." He argues strongly against the internationalist pacifist's contention that
nationality is the cause of war, and that peace is to be obtained by the spread of
cosmopolitanism. On the contrary, he avows, nationality is "actually the one instrument
destined, if wisely directed, to secure lasting and universal peace." This is a statement
which most sane persons to-day will accept easily enough. But the crux is the "wise
direction." Dr. Oakesmith does not give us much practical guidance on this point.
Generalities and fine words are not very helpful, whether they come from the side of
passionate enthusiasts for the League of Nations or from those who, like Dr. Oakesmith,
are a little doubtful whether the world is quite ripe for it. However, the book is well
worth studying, especially on its critical side.</p>

<h4 class="left">WAR-TIME FINANCIAL PROBLEMS. By <span class="smcap">Hartley Withers</span>. Murray. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Hartley Withers is not only a "financial expert"; he is also a really interesting
writer. Even though one may not agree with all his views, one can enjoy this collection
of vigorous essays on war finance, company law and banking, currency problems at
home and abroad, the conscription of wealth, the theory of Guild socialism. Mr. Withers
does not spare his criticism of the Government's financial policy, which has brought us
to the verge of bankruptcy. He dismisses the "capital levy" as impracticable;
but he advocates a high income tax, with super-tax beginning at a much lower level,
and "with skilful differentiation according to the circumstances of the taxpayer."</p>

<h4 class="left">THE GREAT UNMARRIED. By <span class="smcap">Walter M. Gallichan</span>. Werner Laurie.
6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This book is a painstaking attempt to show the evils of celibacy (including the common
state of "pseudo-celibacy") both to society and to the individual. Mr. Gallichan
arraigns the false ideals and the economic pressure of our industrial system, the perverse
influence of ecclesiasticism, and the other causes which produce the myriads of
involuntary or voluntary celibates in the western world. He advocates no "fancy"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
remedies, such as free love, polygamy, or the taxation of bachelors, but rather an
attack on poverty, the spread of education, the moralisation of the marriage laws. The
book is not a profound or scientific study, but it might be instructive to those who
have never given any thought to the subject.</p>

<h4 class="left">ULSTER AND IRELAND. By <span class="smcap">James Winder Good</span>. Maunsel. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This little volume is one of the clearest and the most interesting books that we have seen
on the Irish problem. Mr. Good gives us a survey of Ulster history from the
seventeenth century, which shows the unifying influence of the genuine democratic
ideals common to both the contending parties. He argues that this unification has
been, and is, thwarted by "religion," and by "Carsonism," "the supreme example in
modern times of the triumph of the influences that make for divisions in Ireland."
Sinn Fein, in Mr. Good's view, offers no practicable way out of the difficulty of Ulster.
"If Sinn Fein is," he says, "as it can now claim to be, the creed of the Irish people
it must propound a solution of the Ulster riddle based, not on abstract theories, but
on the realities of the situation." Mr. Good's concluding chapters on "Ulster as
It Is" are excellent reading. We do not suppose Ulster Unionists will agree with all
the views he expresses there, still less with his conclusions&mdash;one of the chief of which
is that Ireland is really one nation and not two. But his book may induce a good many
mere Englishmen to take a more intelligent attitude towards Irish politics.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE GUILD STATE: ITS PRINCIPLES AND POSSIBILITIES. By <span class="smcap">G. R.
Stirling Taylor</span>. Allen &amp; Unwin. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Taylor is an enthusiastic Guildsman, though a heretic, in that he stands for a
localised system as against the orthodox National Guilds. His book is a very naïve
account of the Guild proposals, and we can hardly imagine that it will convert anyone
to his views. There is a vast amount of idealisation of the Middle Ages&mdash;an idealisation
which frequently verges on the ridiculous. Many of the historical statements are
extravagant. We are told, for instance, that Queen Elizabeth "had perhaps the most
honest and most efficient ministers of State that this nation has ever possessed." And
is it not going rather far to say that "the French peasant remains much as he has been
for centuries&mdash;the most substantial fact in European civilisation, and perhaps its
highest product"? Mr. Taylor's style would not suffer if it were less arrogant and less
splenetic. He lets us know, till we are sick of it, that there is but little wisdom in the
world save in the common-sense simple man and the hard-headed Guildsman. And
his virulence against politicians and University professors almost assumes the dimension
of a disease.</p>

<h4 class="left">RECONSTRUCTORS AND RECONSTRUCTION: A PLEA FOR COMMON-SENSE.
By <span class="smcap">Oxon</span>. B.H. Blackwell. 1<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The greater part of this brochure is taken up with a defence of the capitalist against
the attacks of revolutionaries, impossibilists, and all the tribe of intellectual "high
flyers"&mdash;such as Mr. Bernard Shaw, Mr. Chesterton, Mr. Orage, and the late Mr.
Sidney Ball. The author's own plan is to harmonise the interests of capitalists and
workers in a system of "separate autonomous industries co-ordinated with a National
Federal Parliament of Industry." It is in fact something like Guild socialism with
the socialism left out. "Oxon" hardly appears to appreciate the limitations or the
difficulties of his scheme.</p>

<h4 class="left">A PRIMER OF NATIONAL FINANCE. By <span class="smcap">Henry Higgs</span>, C.B. Methuen.
5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This is a purely elementary volume which explains the revenue and expenditure of
the British Government and local authorities, the National Debt, and the study of
financial statistics. It is clearly and simply written, and might be a valuable schoolbook.
For the interested and courageous student there is some useful advice on further
reading. But Mr. Higgs will strike fear into the heart of many beginners by telling them
in the first chapter that the science of finance is so vast a subject that Professor Jèze
of Paris is preparing twelve bulky volumes upon it, and that his elementary treatise
alone consists of over 1100 large octavo pages!</p>

<h3>THEOLOGY</h3>

<h4 class="left">THE SUPREME ADVENTURE. By <span class="smcap">Mercedes Macandrew</span>. Chapman &amp; Hall.
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Certain Nonconformist ministers had a habit&mdash;it is now fast dying&mdash;of interspersing the
reading of the Lesson in service-time with comment and illustration. Mrs. Macandrew
has applied a similar method in this volume. Writing to satisfy the needs of an agnostic
friend, Mrs. Macandrew retells the story of the four Gospels and supports the narrative
with critical expositions of her own or, occasionally, of such authorities as Edersheim.
It is not easy to see for whom the book is intended. Mrs. Macandrew is frankly uncritical.
She not only ignores the whole body of "higher criticism," but she makes no reference
to textual difficulties, and, in discussing such a passage as the Confession of Peter, does
not even mention the fact that a considerable controversy has gathered for some years
around the precise significance of the promise, "On this rock I will build my Church."</p>

<p>It will not be to everybody's taste to have the annunciation described in this way:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>God the Father sent an angel called Gabriel to that city of flowers&mdash;Nazareth in
Galilee&mdash;sent him to a sweet and good and lovely <i>but quite poor girl</i> called Mary who was
soon to be married to a man much older than herself, called Joseph.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And when we tried to read Mrs. Macandrew's paraphrases of the parables we recalled
with a sigh Mr. Birrell's complaint against Canon Farrar, "who elongated the Gospels."
It no doubt gave Mrs. Macandrew some months of happiness to write the book, but
we think she was ill-advised in submitting it to the public.</p>

<h4 class="left">CATALYSIS IN THEORY AND PRACTICE. By <span class="smcap">Eric K. Rideal</span> and <span class="smcap">Hugh S.
Taylor</span>. Macmillan &amp; Co. 17<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>In spite of the difficulties which war-time placed in the way of publishers, the production
of scientific books, both in England and Germany, has been astonishingly
large during the past five years. The greater number of them have&mdash;naturally enough&mdash;been
devoted either to technical subjects or to branches of science having an immediate
technical application. The field of industrial chemistry, especially, has been well
tended by the writers, and not only new books, but new series of books&mdash;such as Messrs.
Longmans' <i>Monographs on Industrial Chemistry</i>, Messrs. Churchill's <i>Textbooks of
Chemical Research</i>, and Messrs. Baillière, Tindall, and Cox's <i>Industrial Chemistry</i> series&mdash;have
appeared to bear witness to the activity of the English chemists. Certain subjects in
particular have been extensively treated; we may instance synthetic colouring matters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
colloid chemistry, and catalysis, the last-named subject having books devoted to it
in all the series just specified. In these the subject is handled from the industrial point of
view, but it is frequently seen that the commercial and the theoretical developments
of a science are mutually stimulating, discoveries made in the laboratory without
any object but the wresting of knowledge from nature finding commercial application,
and the commercial processes suggesting fresh theoretical problems. The great industrial
importance of catalysis has led to a revived interest in the scientific theories of the
process, and the latest book on the subject, by Drs. Eric Rideal and Hugh Taylor,
deserves praise for having devoted considerable attention to the historical and theoretical
aspect of the subject, which has been rather neglected of late.</p>

<p>There are many chemical reactions which are promoted or accelerated by the addition
of a small quantity of some foreign substance which is not used up in the process and
does not appear in the final products. Thus one of the romances of chemistry was the
discovery, occasioned by the chance breaking of a thermometer in the vessel, that the
presence of a small quantity of mercury greatly hastens the oxidation of naphthalene
to phthalic acid, a process of great importance in the manufacture of synthetic indigo.
Similarly the presence of finely divided metals accelerates many reactions, such as
oxidations and hydrogenations&mdash;for example, asbestos impregnated with particles of
platinum promotes the oxidation of sulphur dioxide to the trioxide in the manufacture of
sulphuric acid. The researches of Baker and others, showing that certain gas reactions,
which ordinarily take place rapidly, proceed very slowly indeed if the gases are thoroughly
dried, point to a catalytic action of small traces of moisture. The enzymes of the human
body which accelerate the chemical processes of digestion and assimilation constitute
another class of catalysts, and Drs. Rideal and Taylor class under catalytic action the
effect of radiant energy in promoting such combinations as that of hydrogen and
chlorine, although it is perhaps rather extending the usual conception of the term to do
so. These examples will indicate the wide range of the subject and help to make intelligible
Ostwald's famous generalisation that "there is probably no kind of chemical
reaction which cannot be influenced catalytically, and there is no substance, element,
or compound which cannot act as a catalyser," which is no doubt true if very slight
accelerations of reaction be taken into account. Of course a catalyst cannot affect the
final state of equilibrium, but only quicken or institute (the discussion as to whether,
in some cases, the catalyst initiates or merely accelerates a reaction already taking
place imperceptibly slowly seems to us pointless) a reaction theoretically possible.
Other, the so-called negative, catalysts hinder reactions; other substances "poison,"
or stop, the action of ordinarily activating materials; others again, the "promoters,"
increase the efficacy of the catalyst. The phenomenon is a complex one.</p>

<p>By no means the least interesting and valuable feature of the book before us is the
exposition of the historical development of the subject. We who are apt to look on the
feminine scientist as a product of the last twenty years are reminded that there was
at least one woman chemist of ability in the eighteenth century, Mrs. Fulhame, whose
<i>Essay on Combustion</i>, published in 1774, emphasised the importance of the presence
of moisture in gaseous reactions. Faraday, "the prince of experimenters," also worked on
catalysis, and, in fact, originated the adsorbtion theory of the process, which attributes
the action to the extended compressed film formed at the surface of a porous solid.
It is not only in the chapter expressly devoted to the early history that we find an account
of the original workers; the advances made by them receive recognition throughout
the book in connection with the branches in which they experimented. The treatment
of the various theories of catalysis&mdash;the intermediate compound, the adsorbtion,
electrochemical, and radiant energy theory&mdash;might have been extended with advantage.
The mathematical exposition of the adsorbtion theory is one of the weakest things in
the book, and McLewis's work is not very clearly handled. The difficulties of giving an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
adequate summary of this part of the subject are undoubted, but the need of it is so
marked that we regret that the authors have not spent more energy on the task. This
is not the place to deal in detail with the account of the practical applications of catalysis,
which is excellently done and includes the most recent work, some of it, such as
Partington's improvements in oxidising ammonia, only made public last year. The use
of catalysts in, to take a few examples at random, surface combustion, the hardening of
oils by hydrogenation (used so extensively in margarine making), the fixation of nitrogen,
and electrolysis is well described, and there is a good chapter on ferments and enzymes,
and another on the Grignard reagent. Omissions may be noted here and there, but
the book is not, of course, intended to give detailed instructions to the commercial
chemist. Rather, we believe, is it meant to supply to chemists in general, and even to the
lay reader, an idea of the nature of the process of catalysis, which is becoming more
important every day, and the extent of its applications, with sufficient detail to make
the reactions clear, as far as they are at present understood. As a general exposition of
the subject the book is really needed, and will undoubtedly find a place on the shelves
of all who follow the advances of science.</p>

<h4 class="left">TEN BRITISH PHYSICISTS. By <span class="smcap">Alexander Macfarlane</span>. John Wiley &amp; Sons,
and Chapman &amp; Hall. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Writing of the life of Rankine, Professor P. G. Tait gave as his opinion that "the life of
a genuine scientific man is, from the common point of view, almost always uneventful,"
and, if the man in question has no interests but science, this is, in general, true. Engaged
in researches on the laws of nature, the most that he demands from life is that he shall
have his study, his laboratory, food, shelter and peace, and such an attitude does not
lead to high adventure or romances of passion. Consequently, in writing biographies of
physicists it is advisable not to dwell too long on their everyday life, marriages and
meals, for there is a certain monotony about the material lives of these great men. In
the lives before us, which are little more than sketches, the author has rightly laid
most stress on the scientific achievements of his ten physicists, but he has a tendency
to reduce his account to a catalogue of the discoveries and advances made. An estimate
of the place of each man in the thought of the time, and of his scientific character, of
the general tendencies of his work and the place it now occupies in the history of the
science, deserves to take a rather larger place in these short biographies than it has
received.</p>

<p>Happily many of the ten are men of very interesting personality. The selection&mdash;James
Clerk Maxwell, W. J. M. Rankine, P. G. Tait, Lord Kelvin, Charles Babbage,
William Whewell, Sir G. G. Stokes, Sir G. B. Airy, J. C. Adams, and Sir J. F. W.
Herschel&mdash;if based on no clearly-defined plan, has the merit that it includes one or two
men who have been unduly neglected. Rankine, in spite of his important work on
thermodynamics, does not receive much attention from the physicists of to-day, possibly
owing to his unattractive "molecular vortices," and Babbage is known to most people
rather from the sneer in the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">than for his really great, though imperfect, achievements. Why Babbage is set down as
a physicist, when his whole effort was devoted to the perfecting of calculating machines,
we do not know, but the life is one of the most interesting, and makes an attempt to
expound the causes&mdash;obvious enough, perhaps&mdash;of his misfortunes. It is a generous
appreciation of an ill-starred genius, now seldom heard of. Whewell, again, is scarcely
known as a physicist, but rather as the historian of inductive science; we suppose that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
his writings on the tides have secured him his place. Joule is mentioned in early life,
and was certainly one of the leading physicists of the century, yet he is not among the
selected ten&mdash;neither, for that matter, is Faraday, so it is evident that scientific prowess
has not been the test of admission.</p>

<p>On the whole the ten are versatile men, although no one of them could come near in
diversity of performance to the great Thomas Young, who was not only a physicist of
the first rank but also a physician, a classical scholar, and one of the first successful
decipherers of Egyptian hieroglyphics. Rankine and Whewell were fair poets, and Clark
Maxwell deserves higher praise for his verses. His description of Kelvin's reflecting
galvanometer, in the form of a parody of Tennyson's "Blow, bugle, blow," illustrates
the ease and finish of his light verse:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">O love! you fail to read the scale,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Correct to tenths of a division.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To mirror heaven those eyes were given,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And not for methods of precision&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break, contact, break, set the free light-spot flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break contact, rest thee magnet, swinging, creeping, dying.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The poem is quoted in the life of Kelvin, and two of Rankine's songs are given. We
hope that physicists can still show the same accomplishment.</p>

<p>The lives are well written, and, while not a very profound contribution to the history
of the science, make very pleasant reading for scientist and layman. There is, however,
occasionally a lack of proportion, as when Clark Maxwell's work on electro-magnetic
waves receives little attention compared to his other far less important achievements.</p>

<h2 class="b0">A LETTER FROM FRANCE</h2>

<h3 class="p0">THE PRESENT STATE OF THE FRENCH NOVEL</h3>

<p class="sigright"><i>Paris, October, 1919.</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IN</span> France as much as, and perhaps more than, in England the novel has been since
the eighteenth century the central massif of literature. While in England the
poets and the novelists formed two quite distinct groups, while the poets Byron,
Shelley, Wordsworth, Burns, Tennyson, Swinburne remained pure poets, in
France there have been few poets who have not wished to write novels. Lamartine,
Hugo, Musset, Vigny, Gautier have done so. A pure critic like Sainte-Beuve wished,
with <i>Volupté</i>, to try his hand at the novel. Taine left in manuscript the novel <i>Etienne
Maylan</i> and Renan the novel <i>Patrice</i>; they did not publish these books because they
recognised them to be mediocre, but both wished to obtain the glory of the novelist.
The novel is in France the highest object of literary ambition. It alone assures a position
of material and social importance. Thus it is that a novelist who is read by the upper
and middle classes is necessarily admitted to the Academy while a historian or a
philosopher is admitted only in exceptional circumstances, and great poets like
Baudelaire, Gautier, Banville, Paul Fort remain outside unless they have certain
connections and certain sources of support. The prosperity of the novel at a given
moment may then be considered, in France, as the most obvious mark of a powerful
literary activity. No form of literature addresses a larger public, provokes more discussion,
or gives more of its own colour to a generation or to an epoch. I will endeavour
to indicate here in a few pages the condition of the French novel on the morrow of the war.</p>

<p>Beyond doubt it is passing through a moment of mediocrity. This is not because its
public is beginning to break up. Publishers and readers demand novels. In default of
genuinely new novels many old ones are reissued and read again and cheap reprints are
swarming. Every new novel in which any grain of originality can be perceived is
discussed and brought into the light and sells satisfactorily. And yet nothing so far has
told us of the appearance of the Flaubert, the Zola, the Maupassant of to-morrow.</p>

<p>Naturalism proves to have been the last great school, massive, compact, and powerful,
of the French novel. Well, the survivors of the naturalist movement, such as MM.
Céard, Hennique, Descaves, have ceased to write novels or else, if they still write them,
have given up completely the methods of naturalism, and seek, without success, to adapt
themselves to new tastes. It is not, however, impossible that in a little time from now
naturalism in several ways may again be somewhat in fashion. There is a tendency
among young writers and critics to revise the judgment given in the case of Zola, as
the judgment on Dickens has been revised in England, and to consider that the poverty
and emptiness of his last books has unjustly thrown a shadow on the profound and
powerful works of his maturity. Those works, born of the war, which have been most
favourably received, have been on the whole inspired by naturalist methods of
observation and composition. The European success of <i>Le Feu</i> is due in large part to
the fact that the author applies to the great war the point of view and the methods of
Zola. It was also from the point of view of the story of a squad that Zola wrote <i>La Débâcle</i>.</p>

<p>So far the novel of manners and psychology born of the war has only been attempted by
writers of the older generation, that which knew the masters of the naturalist novel, which
lived their life, which took part, from one side or another of the barricade, in their struggles.</p>

<p>I am here thinking especially of the works written during the war by the doyen of
the French novel, M. Paul Bourget. M. Bourget occupies to-day in the novel a position
analogous to that of Zola in his last years. The young literary generation is hostile to
him or regards him with contemptuous indifference, except that part of this generation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
which is grouped round M. Maurras, whose political ideas he has adopted. He is justly
reproached with a painful style, with conventional psychology in upper and middle
class surroundings, with laborious intrigues carried out according to antiquated formulæ.
He must be regarded, nevertheless, with respect as a great worker, who seeks conscientiously
to extend the limits of his manner, and, above all, as the sole representative to-day
of the old tradition of the French novelists of the nineteenth century&mdash;that of Balzac, of
Sand, of Flaubert, of Maupassant, of Zola. Perhaps he marks the irremediable decadence
of this style which the twentieth century will replace by one more supple and more precise.</p>

<p>The war novels of M. Bourget, <i>Le Sens de la Mort</i>, <i>Nemesis</i>, are mediocre, though
showing always the same technical qualities of solid construction. But he has written a
short <i>nouvelle</i> of profound beauty, <i>Le Justicier</i>, on a great theme of human peace and
reconciliation within a divided family; and this sketches perhaps the general lines of
to-morrow's reconciliations on our torn planet.</p>

<p>Among the innumerable books written by combatants, in which novels abound,
no novel has achieved the powerful interest of certain collections of letters and journals
which render, without literary modelling, fresh, authentic, and actually seen impressions.
The generation which has lived through the war as an immediate and tragic reality has
not written and certainly will not write the novel of the war. The Thackeray, the Balzac,
the Tolstoi of to-morrow have probably been born, but are hardly out of the nursery.</p>

<p>The two forms of the novel preferred by the young generation of to-day are the novel
of adventure and the little novel of irony and sentiment. Neither has yet produced any
great result. The first, after a year, is already out of fashion, and the second will probably
follow it in a few months. And the writers of value who have passed through these
phases are now passing through some other.</p>

<p>The English novel of adventure has been in favour in France for some time. The
novels of Wells have found here for twenty years, like those of Kipling, great numbers
of ardent readers. Before that, a long time ago, in symbolist circles, it was the fashion
to speak with the greatest admiration of Stevenson. And the novels of Chesterton, the
influence of which was visible in André Gide's <i>Les Caves du Vatican</i>, have been appreciated
by a narrower, but select, circle. Nevertheless it was only during the war that
the younger writers were tempted systematically to compose romantic novels of
adventure. The two novels of M. Pierre Benoit, <i>Königsmarck</i> and <i>l'Atlantide</i>, are clever
books, in which old methods are enhanced by a true novelist's temperament. An Englishman
will find little in them which Stevenson, and even Rider Haggard, have not already
given him. The <i>Maître du Navire</i> of M. Louis Chadousne seems to introduce in addition
a note of irony which shows that the author writes to amuse himself and does not
believe in his adventure. And this note of irony is still more obvious in <i>Le Chant de
l'Equipage</i> of M. Pierre Mac-Orlan, which parodies the novel of adventure. The French
novelist is a rationalist who pretends to believe in his mystery and does not believe in
it. Between the adventure of the English novel and the adventure of the French novel
there is the same difference as between the ghost in <i>Hamlet</i> and the ghost which Voltaire
brings on to the stage at full noon, without deceiving anyone, in <i>Semiramis</i>. The novel
of adventure proves to have been a season's fashion which those who launched it
abandon in the following season.</p>

<p>What I have called the little novel of irony and sentiment has had a longer, a more
vivacious, and a more durable existence. It is almost peculiar to French literature and
produces every year a good harvest of agreeable books. It is generally an invertebrate
composition, made up of humorous episodes and reflections, the slight daily impressions
of a man of letters, delicate and fatigued, in Parisian surroundings. It is, as it were, the
chronicle-novel of French literary life.</p>

<p>A great number of the works of M. Abel Hermant belong to this style, and among
them, in particular, the Anglo-French novel, half of Paris, half of Oxford, which he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
now publishing, and the first two parts of which are called <i>L'Aube Ardente</i> and
<i>La Journée Brève</i> (the latter in course of publication in the <i>Revue de Paris</i>). These
are, like M. Hermant's books, the elegantly but frigidly written compositions which
come only from a literary and conventional atmosphere and appear to have been
developed in the author's mind as in an artificial incubator.</p>

<p>The true novel of this sort comes into existence under freer and more fanciful conditions
than obtain in the intelligent and tidy, though somewhat melancholy, manufacture
of M. Hermant. A young writer, who died a score of years ago, Jean de Tinan,
produced masterpieces in <i>Pense-tu réussir?</i> and <i>Aimienne</i>, which have not been surpassed.
To-day this type of novel has a right and a left&mdash;elegance on the right and Bohemianism
on the left, the latter as a rule being more picturesque and more highly flavoured.
On the right there is what one might call, using the word in the sense in which it is
used by historians of mediæval literature, a <i>littérature courtoise</i>&mdash;I mean a literature of
the court with some refinement and some sensuality. Here the author describes his
little amatory adventures, endeavouring to relieve their inevitable banality with a certain
piquancy in the introduction of portraits of his men and women friends, chosen among
an elegant society. <i>Les Papiers de Cleonthe</i>, by M. Jean-Louis Vaudoyer, and <i>Le Diable
a l'Hôtel</i>, by M. Emile Henriot, which have just appeared, though they fall sometimes
into banality, make agreeable reading. On the left there is the little Bohemian novel,
which deals with Montmartre as ancient stories dealt with Miletus. Its characters are
artists and their more or less interesting friends, young women and their more or less
interested friends. The novel of Montmartre, in which style Charles-Louis Philippe
wrote the earliest masterpieces, is practised to-day in the most agreeable fashion by
M. Francis Cares, author of <i>Bob et Bobette</i>, M. Mac-Orlan, author of <i>La Clique
du Café Brebis</i>, and M. André Billy, the author of <i>Scènes de la Vie Littéraire</i>.
Nevertheless these sometimes shady cabarets, where boredom is chased away, must
not be confused with the higher spheres of literature.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The French novel, regarded as a whole, is at the present moment going through
a crisis. The qualities of original, free, and vigorous creation which were the causes of
success from Balzac to Maupassant have become rare. The novel no longer produces
those real and living characters round whom, as Taine said, it is possible to walk. But
it is remarkable for qualities of intelligence.</p>

<p>Alphonse Daudet somewhere makes a distinction between creative novelists and
essayist novelists. The distinction is very just. We lack to-day creative novelists, but we
have a number of essayist novelists. Our contemporary novelists are very intelligent
persons, who are often admirable in their knowledge of human nature, but who rarely
succeed in making it live. It is nevertheless probable that there is nothing to be gained
by retracing our steps. We shall no doubt reach something new by continuing to the
end this exercise of the intellect, by applying it to an increasingly profound and refined
psychological analysis. If we take examples from the English novel, the sign-post of our
French novel of to-day would not be such a name as that of Dickens or of Eliot or of
Kipling but rather that of Meredith. This is what is indicated by the great success now
enjoyed by two complex and delicate writers, M. Marcel Prevost and M. Jean Girandoux.
<i>A l'Ombre de Jeunes Filles en Fleur</i> and <i>Simon le Pathétique</i> are both novels of rich and
fugitive personalities, who are absorbed in the contemplation of themselves, and who
thus find a real world of inward adventures. It seems that the French novel is now
moving by choice in this direction, and that the public is assisting the movement.
This should not be astonishing in a country which has always regarded psychological
analysis as the supreme goal of literature.</p>

<h2>LEARNED SOCIETIES, ETC.</h2>

<h3 class="left">SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">STONEHENGE</span> was formally handed over to the nation on October 26th, 1918,
and H.M. Office of Works at once made plans to secure some of the standing
stones in danger of cracking, and to excavate the entire area without disturbing
the monument. The archæological supervision of the work was entrusted to
the Society of Antiquaries, and the programme was to have a season of about
three months for several consecutive years on the same lines as in 1901, when the
great leaning stone was raised with interesting results. Professor Gowland's health,
however, prevented his participation in the scheme, and his successor, Lieut.-Colonel
Hawley, unfortunately met with an accident, which, with a strike among the contractor's
men, prevented any but preliminary work being carried out on the site this year. If
funds are available&mdash;and the opportunity of solving the riddle of Stonehenge must
appeal to all interested in antiquity&mdash;there is a good prospect of starting in earnest next
summer, without prejudice, it is hoped, to the society's enterprises at Old Sarum and
Wroxeter, the Roman town near Shrewsbury, on both of which sites considerable
progress had been made before the outbreak of war. The recent death of Professor
Haverfield is one of many severe losses incurred by the society during the past summer.</p>

<h3 class="left">SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS</h3>

<p>For years the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings has been associated
with the work of protesting against the destruction or spoiling of good examples of the
building art of the past. This year it is developing the more constructive side of its
activities. The following instances will suffice to illustrate this development.</p>

<p>First, the Society is endeavouring to show that the humbler forms of English architecture&mdash;the
old cottages&mdash;should not only be saved, but used, and how they can be
made decently habitable, though much injured by time and neglect. Works replete with
old-time building lore should not be permanently condemned because they lack damp
courses, proper ventilation, larders, or upstair fireplaces. Instead of building new at
£800 or so, the Housing Committees should acquire cottages of this kind and repair them
at, say, £250 or £300. To draw attention to this subject the Society has issued a well-illustrated
booklet (Batsford, 94 High Holborn; 2s.), which it hopes to follow by a practical
demonstration on a pair of old cottages, proving the possibility of remedying common
defects. It hopes to publish the results in a second booklet which would in fact be a
pictorial specification.</p>

<p>The second illustration of the Society's constructive activity is the offer to give
lectures on the objects and work of the Society, in which special emphasis is to be laid
on what may be learnt in matters of economy and beauty, from old buildings.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE ROYAL NUMISMATIC SOCIETY</h3>

<p>The Royal Numismatic Society has removed from 22 Albemarle Street to
22 Russell Square, W.C.1, where meetings will be held and the library is housed.
On October 16th, Sir Henry Howorth, Vice-President, in the Chair, Mr. Lawrence
read a note on some of the difficulties of distinguishing halfpence from farthings during
the period between 1465 and 1523. Parliament in the latter year directed some alteration
of type of the farthings, as it was shown that halfpennies and farthings were with
difficulty distinguishable owing to both denominations having been struck from the
same "coin." A discussion was also raised on the profile half-groats of Henry VII.
bearing the mint-marks martlet and rose. Some of these have keys below the shield on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the reverse and others are without the keys. The question raised was whether these
later coins were to be considered as having been struck at York in consequence of the
martlet mint-mark, previously only known at York, or whether the absence of the
keys denoted their issue at London. Mr. Brooke and Col. Morrieson urged that these
coins were <i>sede vacante</i> issues of York.</p>

<p>Mr. H. Mattingly read a paper entitled "A. Vitellius Imp. Germanicus," in which
he attempted to determine the reasons for the variations in Vitellius's obverse legends,
between the forms <i>Imp. Germ.</i> and <i>Germ. Imp.</i> After distinguishing clearly the class
of coins on which these titles appear, he brought evidence to show that the title
<i>Imp. Germanicus</i> is characteristic of the non-Roman coins of Vitellius and of the
early period of the reign before the victory over Otho. It implied a definite challenge
thrown out by the German armies to the rest of the Empire, and in consequence when
Vitellius became constitutional Emperor at Rome the title was deftly deprived of
offence by inversion to <i>Germanicus Imp.</i>, a normal form of title already borne by
Claudius and Nero.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p>The forty-second annual meeting of the Library Association was notable, not by
reason of its bibliographical or literary interest, for either was to seek, but as marking
a definite cleavage between librarians and the Board of Education upon a matter of
national importance. Were it not that education in this country has always been the
province of the amateur, one might say that the cleavage was between amateur and
professional opinion. The third interim report of the Adult Education Committee to
the Ministry of Reconstruction proposed to hand over the control of the Public Library
to the Local Education Authority; the Library Association, as a body possessed of a
charter for the support and advancement of the public library movement, opposed the
main recommendations of that report and returned to the Minister of Education a
memorandum of counter argument. The four points of the memorandum were:
(1) "That, with the already heavy responsibilities of the Education Authority, an
additional duty&mdash;problems requiring detached consideration&mdash;will result in the
convenient relegation of the library to a mere appendage of the school; (2) that, although
co-operation between school and library does exist, the initiative has come almost
wholly from the latter, and that assimilation by the comparatively untried and
empirical "1918 model" education will be fatal to its general usefulness; (3) that
the interest of the public is the main interest of the library, and that this is
subordinated by the Adult Education Committee to the special interest of the school;
(4) that the recommendations upon the provision of technical and commercial books
were unduly extravagant and wasteful as regarding the first, but unduly parsimonious
and wrongly conceived in the case of the second. To this document, beyond a bare
acknowledgment, no reply has been given. Its form and tenor were unanimously
approved by the Association at Southport.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY</h3>

<p>The Bibliographical Society opens its 28th Session on November 17th, with a paper
by Mr. R. F. Sharp, of the British Museum, on "Travesties of Shakespeare's Plays."
The Society has not only kept up its normal output of books during the war, but
has produced some volumes of exceptional importance, notably Mr. Gordon Duff's
wonderfully complete record of <i>English Fifteenth-Century Books</i>, with facsimiles of all
the types used in them; Mr. E. F. Bosanquet's illustrated Monograph on <i>English
Printed Almanacks and Prognostications</i>; the first volume of Professor Carleton
Brown's <i>Register of Middle-English Religious Verse</i>; and two exceptionally interesting
volumes of <i>Transactions</i>. <i>A Bibliography of Landor</i>, by Mr. Stephen Wheeler and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
Mr. T. J. Wise, will shortly be issued, and the second volume of Professor Carleton
Brown's <i>Register</i> should be ready early next year. The books of the Society are only
printed for its own members, and until 1914 it was a close corporation, with an
English and American membership limited to 300. In the January before the war
it opened its ranks in order to obtain a hundred additional members and further
increase its output. It is still open to book lovers to join at the old subscription of a
guinea, but unless the Annual Meeting in January next decides otherwise, the roll of
the Society is due to be closed on the third Monday of the new year. That the
Society has done so well during the war is largely due to its genial President, Sir
William Osler, who has held office longer than any of his predecessors and is soon
further to help the Society by producing for it a Monograph on the Medical books
published by the earliest printers, <i>i.e.</i> not later than 1480. Among the earlier
presidents were Dr. Garnett and Mr. Fortescue, of the British Museum, the late
Earl of Crawford, Mr. H. B. Wheatley, and Mr. A. H. Huth, owner of the splendid
library which has already furnished material for eight sales at Sotheby's. Mr. A. W.
Pollard, the present Keeper of Printed Books at the British Museum, has been its
Hon. Secretary since 1893, and was given some years ago a notable partner in
Mr. R. B. McKerrow, the Editor of Nashe.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE FOLKLORE SOCIETY</h3>

<p>During the war the Folklore, like other societies, has suffered by the absence of some
of its most active members on service, but the work of the Society has not been interrupted,
its meetings have been regularly held, many valuable contributions have been
received, and the attendance has been well maintained. <i>Folk-lore</i>, the quarterly Proceedings,
has retained its position as one of the leading authorities on popular beliefs
and superstitions of races in the lower stage of culture. Its principal function is to
publish papers read by members at the Society's meetings, and to review the more
important literature on subjects in which it is interested. But it also welcomes from the
general public notes and queries on British and foreign folklore and beliefs. The foundations
have been laid for two important works which, it is hoped, will soon be ready for
publication. As regards the folklore of these islands, the leading authority is the <i>Observations
on Popular Antiquities</i>, by John Brand, subsequently edited by Sir H. Ellis. Large
collections have been made under the supervision of Miss S. C. Burne, an ex-president
of the society and author of a valuable book on the folklore of Shropshire, with a view
to the compilation on the basis of Brand's work of a cyclopedia of British folklore. The
second work now in progress is a general index to the long series of special books and
Proceedings issued by the society since its foundation, the work of compilation having
been entrusted to Mr. A. R. Wright.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE SOCIETY OF PURE ENGLISH</h3>

<p>The Society of Pure English, which was founded shortly before the war, and which
during the war was temporarily suspended, has now begun to carry out its original
purpose, and probably before this note appears its first two pamphlets will have been
published. Pamphlet No. 1 will contain a list of the members of the Society and a reprint
of the original prospectus, which was privately printed in 1913, and which contains
a statement of the Society's aims in general terms. Pamphlet No. 2 will consist of a
discussion by the Poet Laureate of a curious and hitherto almost unnoticed phenomenon
of contemporary speech, the great increase, namely, of homophones, or words of the
same sound but different meanings, in the English language. As the original prospectus
shows, the Society does not in the least aim at the absurd project of "fixing" the language&mdash;its
conception is rather that, since all living languages change and must change as
life changes, an attempt should be made to guide this necessary process by acknowledged
principles of tradition and taste.</p>

<h2>DRAMA</h2>

<h3>A LIVING CORPSE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THIS</span> section opens amid a furore for improving the Drama in this
country. Leagues have sprung up, with imposing committees of enormous
length, and are canvassing for money and members with considerable
success. A Conference of the Theatre, lasting a fortnight, was held
in the summer at Stratford-upon-Avon for the first time in history,
at which actors, dramatic critics, trade unionists, authors, publishers, newspaper
proprietors, theatrical managers, voice trainers, poets, scenic artists, school teachers,
clergymen, and one bishop expressed day after day their intense determination to
have more drama and better drama than we have ever had in England before. This
assemblage of people, whom as one of them I may perhaps be permitted to call without
offence fanatics, may have appeared to the detached onlooker to have been of very
little use. The Conference melted away, leaving the British Drama League and the Arts
League of Service still without sufficient money to do any of the practical things
without which the gathering of conferences and the sitting of committees are merely
occasions for the ventilation of private grievances.</p>

<p>But the Conference could never have been held if there were not, widespread through
the country, a genuine passion for the theatre far more extensive and far stronger
than it had ever been in England during the whole of the nineteenth century. There
are no statistics available to give us the percentage of the population who were regular
theatre-goers during the last century, but it was certainly very small, and everyone
knows that it has increased enormously during the last ten years, and has probably
even doubled again during the war. This is a fact which is generally overlooked, but
which really provides us with the soundest basis for hope. What is the matter with the
theatre in England is mainly that there is not enough of it. Nearly all its faults and
shortcomings may be put down to deficiencies of <i>matériel</i>, both structural and human.
<i>There are not enough theatres</i>, those in existence are obsolete, cranky, ill-ventilated,
absurdly constructed, badly placed buildings, an eyesore to passers-by, a hell of discomfort
for 90 per cent. of the audience, a death-trap for actors. Only a fanatical human
passion for the theatre could drive people into such places away from the comparative
comfort of their own firesides. <i>There are not enough actors</i>, and those that survive the
barbaric tortures of rushing week by week from one cold and slatternly apartment-house
to another, always arriving in their next provincial town on the dismallest of
Sundays, generally find that they are the one spark of life in the place, and end, like
Sir Henry Irving, by expiring in their miserable and draughty dressing-rooms. The
English provincial town in its dreariness and dirt awaits the coming of the actor much
as the Esquimaux in winter await the coming of the sun, but the actor during the day
when he is free wanders through its streets as Virgil wandered by the banks of the
Styx&mdash;forlorn, and like a man among shadows who have no commerce with him, but
belong to another world. It is no wonder that they become more and more divorced
from their fellow-creatures, more and more inefficient, more and more lacking in zest
for experiment and enterprise, until neglected and isolated the profession sinks, with
bright exceptions, to a level of illiteracy, incompetence, and sloth that lately even in
London moved a commercial manager like Mr. Cochran to express his astonishment.</p>

<p>But the municipal councils, which are the civic committees of the townspeople entrusted
with organising their social life, cannot remain for ever indifferent to their duty
in face of a growing popular demand for the theatre; that is why I point to the enormous
increase in the number of habitual theatre-goers as our strongest basis of hope. Or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
if they do so persist private enterprise will inevitably step in, as it did in the case of so
many electric-lighting, tramway, gas, and water undertakings, build up a profitable
theatrical business, mulct the town annually of thousands of pounds in profits, and
ultimately will have to be bought out by the municipality at an inflated price. As Mr.
Granville Barker pointed out in an extraordinarily able speech at the Shakespeare
Memorial Theatre, the people's greatest need is to become articulate. Art means nothing
if it does not mean giving speech to the people, and the art of the Drama is the most
democratic, the most popular, the most wide-reaching, the most easily understood,
and the most stimulating, because the most social of all the arts. There was a time, and
it is not so very long ago, when primary education in its most rudimentary, that is to
say, its school form, was left to private enterprise, and if private enterprise could have
done it at all it might possibly have done it better than the nation; but every argument
that can be used in favour of teaching everyone to read and write applies still more
forcibly to giving the people a real education. It is far too important and too urgent
to be left to the chance provision of speculators out merely to make profits for themselves,
and it is to enlighten public opinion on the subject that these leagues have primarily been
founded. But let me not be mistaken. There can be no intention of priggishly educating
the people in the "higher drama." We must carefully discriminate between advocating
for theatres&mdash;municipal, if possible, but if not, private&mdash;and advocating for the performance
of plays by any dramatist or school or coterie of dramatists. The Drama is a
much bigger thing than Mr. Shaw, Ibsen, Chekhov, or anyone else, and what has
always prevented these movements from gaining popular sympathy has been their
lack of breadth, their curious fascination for pedants and cranks. Almost every decent,
sane human being will appreciate and support a demand for a theatre to enlighten the
dismal misery and boredom of the winter evenings of his native town and to take him
out of the narrow groove into which he will inevitably stick if left alone with his books
and his relations; but he will not support a scheme to ram down his throat obvious
propaganda.</p>

<h4 class="left">The Calvinists of the Drama</h4>

<p>I have sat for hours in the National Gallery, Trafalgar Square, watching the people.
The most heterogeneous collection of persons imaginable assemble there. Washerwomen,
soldiers, artisans, clerks, clergymen, navvies, all classes and ages. Some wander aimlessly
about, some stand petrified before one picture for a quarter of an hour, some look only
at portraits, others search for familiar landscapes, others again are attracted by historical
interest. There is hardly one of them that would not probably earn the contempt of
Mr. Clive Bell if he were to give Mr. Bell the reason of his enjoyment; but I assert
with all the emphasis I can command that there is not one of them who has not gained
by even ten minutes within that building something impossible to value and precious,
beyond estimation. Can any human being go out of the dirt, the indignity, the ugliness,
the noise, the formlessness of the modern city into the serenity, the colour, the dignity,
the peace, and the beauty of the rooms of the National Gallery without a quickening of
the spirit, however imperceptible? What is there in Trafalgar Square apart from the
National Gallery which in any degree witnesses that man is more than an animal?
True, there is St. Martin's Church, but the associations of the church&mdash;irrelevant if you
will&mdash;adulterate and weaken its spiritual influence on men's minds to-day. But the
National Gallery exerts a completely catholic and irradiating power on all who enter.</p>

<p>So does the theatre, even exactly as it stands to-day. I am in profound disagreement
with those who raise up their hands in horror at the present state of the theatre where it
exists. What causes me to join the chorus of Jeremiahs is the scarcity of theatres, their
complete and utter absence in hundreds of large towns where they should exist, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
the smallness of their numbers in our largest cities. My mention of Mr. Clive Bell
in connection with the National Gallery was doubly relevant, for there is a set of high-brows
connected with the theatre who have set their eyes so fixedly on an unreal and
abstract perfection that they have become blind. They talk about Serious Drama in
the same solemn, pompous and hopeless way that the Calvinists used to talk about
salvation, and the mass of the people, cheerfully ignoring them, continues to go tranquilly
to perdition. Ask anyone of these apostles of Serious Drama to show you one serious
drama, and the odds are that they will say, <i>Man and Superman</i> or <i>Ghosts</i> or <i>Justice</i>.
Well, there is something to be said for the authors of these three plays, although not
one of them is a really first-rate dramatist, the equal of Shakespeare, Sophocles,
Euripides, or even Racine, but for their followers&mdash;the dealers in the doleful realism of
Manchester, Birmingham, Liverpool, Glasgow, and the London suburbs&mdash;there is in
the main nothing to be said whatever. Their works are for the most part immeasurably
inferior to the average London Revue, and to accuse the theatre of sinking into degradation
because it prefers the wit, humour, beautiful dressing, vivacious dancing, and high
spirits of an Ambassador's, Vaudeville, Pavilion, or Alhambra Revue to a serious,
machine-made play by Mr. Sutro or two hours of mechanical dulness from someone
I had better not name is simply to accuse it of preferring life to the undesirable
"seriousness" of the tomb.</p>

<h4 class="left">Influence of the Existing Theatre</h4>

<p>It is not as if there were no drama better than the Revue or the Musical Comedy,
but the stupidity of the high-brows, their dull acceptance of the solemn and the
pompous, of anything in fact that is not bright or imaginative or stirring, but is
sufficiently pretentious, does incalculable harm to that annually growing fraction of the
public which, fully appreciative of Revue and Musical Comedy, is yet unsatisfied and is
really thirsting for finer things. This public is continually essaying samples of the drama
of the high-brows and is continually being driven back from such dry, unprofitable
verbiage to those theatres where there is humour, wit, charm and beauty. And for this
evidence of good taste it is roundly abused. I frequently wonder whether anyone of
these misguided zealots has ever been inside the popular theatre, the theatre of the
Musical Comedy. Have they any idea what a revelation of beauty it is to large numbers
of the population? I dare to assert that in London the popular theatre has done more
to develop and educate the taste of the masses in dress, furniture, and decoration than
fifty years of propaganda from Ruskin, William Morris, and all their disciples. The
theatre, of course, has learnt from the artists of all countries, but it has been the great
cultural organisation which has taken the fruits of the artists' work to the people and
opened their eyes.</p>

<p>In educating the senses the popular theatre has done and is still doing invaluable
work; it is when it comes to educating the finer emotions that it fails so lamentably,
though hardly so utterly as the high-brow theatre, in which there are no emotions but
those of despair, disillusionment and derision. And yet it is strange that in spite of
the general abuse of the low standards of London plays, on the rare occasions when
a really fine play is put on it is generally met by the critics with a chorus of disapproval
or the praise that damns. We have had a good example in London recently. Mr. Henry
Ainley, by common consent our finest actor, begins his management of the St. James's
Theatre with Tolstoy's <i>The Living Corpse</i>, the title being changed to <i>Reparation</i>, in
consideration of the mental state of a public frightened out of its wits by the high-brows
and the cranks. Tolstoy was a great man, and <i>The Living Corpse</i> is a fine play, a play that
ought to have a great success; but do the critics say, "Here at last is a magnificent
play, a play which everyone must see"? Not a bit of it. The general spirit of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
notices is one of chilly respect for the famous name of Tolstoy, with an insinuation
that the play would have been much better if it had been handled by a competent
dramatist like Sir Arthur Pinero or Mr. Sutro. "What is the central theme? We are
not quite sure," says the critic of the leading London daily. Is it a mere coincidence
that on the same page that journal's musical critic, in reference to <i>Prometheus</i>, the work
of Tolstoy's compatriot, Scriabin, one of the greatest of modern composers, says he
does not understand it and, asking himself whether Scriabin was "sane or deranged,"
declares that he does not know? Here is a lesson for Drama Leagues, for it is almost
certain that when we do get good drama scarcely anyone will know it.</p>

<p>A society called "The Phœnix," with headquarters at Dudley House, Southampton
Street, Strand, has been formed to revive plays of Elizabethan, Restoration, and later
times. The following plays have been selected for early production:</p>

<p><i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> (John Webster), <i>Marriage à la Mode</i> (John Dryden), <i>The Fair
Maid of the West</i>, Part I. (Thomas Heywood), <i>Don Carlos</i> (Thomas Otway), <i>Volpone</i>

<h3>DRAMATIC LITERATURE</h3>

<h4 class="left"><span class="smcap">HEARTBREAK HOUSE, etc.</span> By <span class="smcap">Bernard Shaw</span>. Constable. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></h4>

<p>Mr. Shaw is one of the most consistent authors living. His readers know almost to a
comma what he is going to give them every time they open his latest book. That is perhaps
the chief reason why there has been such a falling off in Mr. Shaw's popularity of
recent years. Another reason is, of course, the war; but it is strange that Mr. Shaw's
opinions, or his particular way of expressing his opinion, during the war should have
alienated and even made bitterly hostile men of wide knowledge and experience of his
writings and his character who, if they could be persuaded momentarily to reflect
without prejudice, would have to admit that what offends them now was precisely
what offended so many others in the years before the war, when they on the contrary
were Mr. Shaw's ardent champions or, at the very least, his apologists. It only goes to
show how very far anyone of us is from being able to judge a man's work rationally
once our own particular prejudice is touched. We are all raw somewhere, and woe
to the man who touches us on the raw, for then all hope of dispassionate criticism, of
Christian toleration even, is gone. It has been Mr. Shaw's most vivid characteristic
that he has never lost his intellectual integrity. It is easy to be honest among one's
enemies, but to be honest among one's friends is a virtue so rare, so uncomfortable,
and outwardly so contrary to the spirit of fair play that it is not surprising it should be
generally detested. Mr. Shaw has always retained what he believes, perhaps conceitedly,
to be his right to say the worst that can be said of his dearest friends, and of the advocates
of whatever cause happens at the moment to be nearest to his heart. However ruinous
such conduct may appear to be to the immediate interests of the movement he is
supposed to support, he will not abandon his right to forge weapons for the enemy more
damaging than any discoverable by their own brains. When life or one's country or one's
family is at stake, such conduct appears little less than devilish, yet Mr. Shaw has
his right to express his opinions as lucidly and as pointedly as he can, and it
may be that when we are far enough removed from the heat and blinding dust of the
moment's conflict we shall realise that Mr. Shaw has been faithful to the truth that is
in him, and if we have any reason to complain it is certainly not of Mr. Shaw, but of the
God who made him.</p>

<p>It may seem that what the ordinary man would call, and call wrongly, Mr. Shaw's
unreliability does not square with the assertion that he is consistent, and that his readers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
know beforehand exactly what Mr. Shaw is going to give them. But Mr. Shaw's
consistency lies in his artillery, not in his object of attack. The enemy varies, but the same
guns are always going off. In <i>Heartbreak House</i> there is at times all and more than all
the old brilliancy. The dialogue of the first and third acts is concentrated, savage, and
burns with an intensity that casts a dull imaginative glow over the play. The characters
of the Hushabyes, of Captain Shotover, of the sham millionaire Mangan, of Mazzini
Dunn, and the fluteplayer are drawn with a pen steeped in vitriol and, exaggerated as
they are, they have a genuine imaginative reality deeper than most Shavian figures.
There is a moral passion in this play gloomier and more savage than in anything Mr.
Shaw has yet done, and an absence of that childish and inconsequent flippancy which
so often mars his work. The other plays in the volume vary in quality from some
excellent fooling in <i>Great Catherine</i> to a depressing mechanical liveliness, almost
utterly without humour, in <i>Augustus Does His Bit</i>. The best of them is <i>O'Flaherty, V.C.</i>;
but although it frequently makes one laugh one finds oneself, at the end, closing the
book with that tired yawn that seems to be the fatal consequence of reading a great
deal of Mr. Shaw at one time.</p>

<h4 class="left">FIRST PLAYS. By <span class="smcap">A. A. Milne</span>. Chatto &amp; Windus. 6<i>s,</i></h4>

<p>I am not sure that I do Mr. Milne any injustice by asserting that the best thing in his
first volume of plays is the Introduction, describing how the five plays came to be
written. It is turned with that inimitable grace and lightness of touch which have made
Mr. Milne famous as a journalist. Mr. Milne's charm and quaint humour need a certain
space in which to display themselves. It would be fatal to hurry him or to try to
straighten his meanderings and digressions, but that is exactly what the dramatic form
does do. It is not that Mr. Milne cannot express himself in a few sentences, he can;
but however few the sentences they will be allusive, indirect, full of parabolas and
curves that seem to lead away but really come back to the point. These qualities are
difficult to transfer to dialogue, especially when one is hampered by the consciousness
of theatrical convention, and in his first effort, <i>Wurzel-Flummery</i>, after inventing that
wonderful name, Mr. Milne fails entirely to get his own individual qualities into the
play. The dialogue is in short, flavourless sentences that seem to have been shot out
of a popgun, and the characters being mere lay-figures, the play is simply dull. The
<i>Lucky One</i> is a much more ambitious and more successful experiment. The people are
alive, but Mr. Milne is probably right in seeing no hope of its being produced. It is
intelligence without frills or decoration; and, as he says, "the girl marries the wrong
man." It is in <i>Belinda</i> that Mr. Milne is most successfully himself. Mr. Milne calls it
an "April Folly in three acts." and that describes it exactly.</p>

<h2>THE FINE ARTS</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IT</span> may be of interest at this juncture, now that the "close time" for artists between
the spring and autumn exhibitions has come to an end, to review past events
in artistic circles, and attempt to place readers <i>au courant</i> with events to
come. The war has not been without its effects on some branches of artistic
development. The supporters of Burlington House, it is true, pursue their way
more or less undisturbed by the startling incidents of the last four years; I would be
inclined to rank with them the greater part also of the members of the International
Society of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers, whose twenty-sixth exhibition is now
being held at the Grosvenor Galleries.</p>

<p>It is only fair to say, however, that the so-called revolutionary in art can sometimes
find a place for his work even on these august walls.</p>

<p>The New English Art Club has been handicapped by the commandeering of its
gallery by the Government. Still, here again the god-fathers and professors still hold
the sway, and it is only in such bodies as the Allied Artists Association, the Friday
Club, and the London Group, that the new blood can be more or less assured of a place
to exhibit their work and obtain their share in the business of acceptance for, and
arrangement of, exhibitions. All these societies are now firmly established, though the
last-named has sustained a great loss by the death of its admirable president, Harold
Gilman. The Allied Artists is a thoroughly democratic institution and a step towards
a trade union of artists, if such a thing is possible: that some step in that direction is
needed there can be no doubt, as the artist suffers very severely indeed from the middleman.
These societies, then, in their exhibits generally, show renewed signs of energy
and development in art.</p>

<p>The employment of younger men in an official capacity as war artists instead of
such Academicians as were not too infirm to bear the weight of a steel helmet, showed
unusual wisdom and perspicuity on behalf of the responsible bodies concerned. The
direct result was a fine collection of paintings by men who, for the most part, had been
able to depict their impressions of war in war's surroundings, or record their experiences,
not easily forgotten, after they had been freed from the ranks. An exhibition of these paintings
held in America was attended with marked success, and helped to make known the
work of young English artists in that country. C. R. W. Nevinson, Paul Nash, Wyndham
Lewis, and Eric Kennington, to mention only a few, have produced some fine and
lasting records of their impressions <i>in medias res</i>. The public will have an opportunity
of seeing the fine collection of paintings commissioned and collected by the Imperial
War Museum this winter. The effect of this official employment is particularly noticeable
upon the more extreme body of painters known as the Vorticists with Wyndham
Lewis at the head: they have voluntarily or involuntarily made certain concessions to
representation ("compromise" is in bad odour now) in their work, but these concessions
have in no way weakened the results of their toil, as appeared evident at the Canadian
War Memorials Exhibition this spring.</p>

<p>Turning to other events&mdash;the exhibition of foreign artists at the Mansard Gallery,
which has recently closed, is, I believe, the first one of its kind since the post-impressionist
Exhibition at the Grafton Galleries before the war. Now, as then, I fancy, it
will be found to be a case of a little garden in a patch of wilderness. Mr. Clive Bell
would perhaps have us bow unreservedly before the lions of the continent, but I feel
that some of the artists are only repeating with variations the themes given out by their
forerunners. Even the work of the accepted masters, such as Picasso and Derain, and
so forth, does not seem quite convincing at first sight, but perhaps these were acting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
purposely as foils to their younger contemporaries. The Exhibition was, nevertheless,
of great interest, especially if we may take it to show roughly the various tendencies of
continental art.</p>

<p>The Memorial Exhibition of the works of Harold Gilman at the Leicester Galleries
deserves special notice. Harold Gilman died suddenly of influenza this spring. To
everyone who knew him his death must have come as a severe shock; his unfailing
courtesy and true gentleness of manner had endeared him to many. As an artist, the
sane outlook and sincere purpose in his work were valuable assets to whatever movement
he was connected with. It is difficult at this time to estimate his value as a painter, but
I am inclined to think it will be considerable. He had elaborated a fine sense of colour
which was as effective in his painting as it was useful in his teaching. His work, hung
all together in this exhibition, seems far more striking than when seen in isolated
examples, the drawings forming a decidedly important part of the whole. He was not
accustomed to show these drawings nor did he seem to value them very much, except
as a means to the end; and I am surprised by their excellence. No. 23 is a design for a
large painting commissioned by the Canadian Government, and left unfinished at his
death. No. 37 is one of the gems of the collection. An illustrated memorial volume of
Gilman's work will be published shortly. Other picture shows forthcoming in London
during the autumn and winter are&mdash;an exhibition of the works of Matisse, Mr.
Marchant's Salon, open for the first time since the war at the Goupil Galleries, the
Imperial War Museum Exhibition, and the London Group at the Mansard Gallery in
November.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>To the most hardened critic the sounding title of the International Society of
Sculptors, Painters, and Engravers may seem a little overaweing; each time, as the
Society's exhibition comes round, he must feel this peculiar thrill; the catalogue also,
with its crescendos of lay members, honorary lay members, and deceased honorary lay
members, has a conscious feeling of "well-to-do-ness" which is very impressive, and
may tend to undermine impartial judgment. The twenty-sixth exhibition of this Society
is, notwithstanding, very like many others which have gone before. A long search for
instances of any serious purpose, with a few exceptions, meets with nothing but superficial
cleverness or work of a purely negative value. As in the exhibitions of Burlington House,
so here, the artists seem entirely concerned with the portrayal of the anecdote for itself,
without the least regard for design, in fact with the least amount of solid purpose or
feeling, and with the free use of cheap <i>bravura</i> painting. There are, of course, the well-known
stand-bys who provide what is expected of them with satisfactory regularity.
Mr. MacEvoy's portraits of the nobility and gentry seem more and more evanescent,
and one would hardly credit them with a drop of red blood, let alone blue&mdash;but they
have their charm. The portraits in general are not peculiarly interesting, characterised
as they are by good but uninspired painting. Mr. Frampton's No. 29 is a case in point.
The only bright exception, both as a portrait and a work of art, is Mr. Alvaro Guevara's
portrait of Miss Edith Sitwell, which alone is worth paying 1s. 6d. to see. The painting
throughout is curiously realistic, the colour is very fine, and the arrangement of the
figure so as to present a view looking down upon it, together with the placing of the
mats on the floor, make a most interesting design. Placed as it is among the portraits
of Mr. MacEvoy, the contrast is startling and a little cruel, not unlike a bird of paradise
amongst a batch of ring-doves. I am surprised to see that the perseverance of the firm of
Nicholson and Son, though the business is now mostly carried on by Mr. Benjamin
Nicholson, has not yet been awarded by royal warrant. No one, I hope, will be so
obtuse as not to distinguish the filial from the paternal jug. Considerable mention has
been made of the landscapes in water-colour by Miss Frances Hodgkins, and though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
cannot quite agree with all that has been said, I think her work has charm and a strong
sense of pattern. No. 214, <i>Threshing</i>, is especially attractive. The drawings of J. D. Revel
will repay attention, particularly No. 194. Mr. Keith Baynes contributes two
pleasing drawings, one of which has an interesting design of boats, while Mr. William
Rothenstein has a good but very war-like self-portrait. I feel glad my acquaintance
with him has been so far only in a civilian capacity. It would appear that sheep-skin
jerkins are regulation dress for official war-artists.</p>

<h3>ARTISTIC PUBLICATIONS</h3>

<h4 class="left">Art and Letters</h4>

<p>With the autumn number of <i>Art and Letters</i> the periodical completes its fourth
publication since the beginning of the new series. <i>Art and Letters</i> was first published in
July, 1917, under the editorship of Frank Rutter, Harold Gilman, and Charles Ginner,
and was devoted to the reproduction of the graphic arts and the publication of short
essays, stories, poems, and reviews. After the first four numbers the magazine came
under the management of Mr. Frank Rutter and Mr. Osbert Sitwell, who changed the
cover from a set design to one of a varied pattern each quarter.</p>

<p><i>Art and Letters</i> has continued to supply a certain demand as an artistic quarterly,
and indeed, with the exception of <i>Colour</i>, it seems to be the only periodical which
reproduces the works of younger contemporary artists. The first numbers contained
some excellent drawings by Walter Sickert, Harold Gilman, and Charles Ginner, with
woodcuts by Lucien Pissaro; later, work by Paul Nash, MacKnight Kauffer, and
Therèse Lessore formed a pleasing contribution. With the inception of the new series
in 1918, the paper was given fresh impetus and still maintains its high level. A criticism
which applies to many other like publications may be also applied to <i>Art and Letters</i>:
it is too precious. There is need of a wider scope and more general appeal to the public.</p>

<p>The chief item of artistic interest in Volume 2, No. 4, of <i>Art and Letters</i>, which has
just appeared, is the drawing by Modigliani, who was one of the most promising
exhibitors at the recent exhibition of Continental Artists held at the Mansard Gallery,
and referred to above. This is really a beautiful drawing, delicate and sensitive; the
artist, while relying chiefly on the rhythmic value of his line, has introduced ever so
slightly into the face the literary interest, so to speak, of a subtle expression which is
the quintessence of placid kindness. There are also excellent drawings by the late
Gaudier Brzeska and Wyndham Lewis, and a wood-cut by Paul Nash which, at the
risk of being censored for partiality, I venture to think is of interest in another branch
of his art. The drawing by Miss Anne Estelle Rice is competent and decorative. A new
periodical entitled <i>The Owl</i> was hatched in the early summer, in which the excellence
of the literary contributions greatly outweighed the value of the artistic reproductions.
I hope in the future that the art editor will range a little wider in his choice of drawings.</p>

<h4 class="left">The Poetry Bookshop</h4>

<p>Mr. Harold Monro is publishing a series of monthly chap-books, which has already
run into three numbers; it purports to be a record of the poetry and drama of to-day.
In so far as it bears upon these columns, Volume 2 is of interest as containing reproductions
of Mr. Albert Rutherstone's theatre designs for Bernard Shaw's play, <i>Androcles
and the Lion</i>, produced at St. James's Theatre before the war. This is altogether an
admirable and valuable little book. The most recently published number is entitled
<i>Poems Newly Decorated</i>, and contains some charming and effective designs by the
younger artists.</p>

<h2 class="gesperrt">MUSIC</h2>

<h3>THE PROMENADE CONCERTS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IT</span> has been good to see the Queen's Hall filled once more with a happy crowd,
after the thin and uncertain audiences which listened to the Promenade Concerts
during the war. Even to a jaded professional critic there is a peculiar sense of
pleasure to be derived from them which no other concerts can convey. One is
free to smoke, to begin with, and free to move about and see one's friends;
for that is one of the pleasant things about a Promenade Concert, that one always
finds friends there. And just as one finds unexpected old friends on the floor of the
house, so one finds them in the programme. There are many works from which the
hardened concert-goer flees when he sees them put in to fill up time in an ordinary
symphony concert. At the Promenades he may find himself listening to them in the
company of someone who has never heard them before, and suddenly discover that
they have taken on a new aspect in relation to all the music which memory has
accumulated since the last time that he came across them. The more heterogeneous
the programme, the more delightful it is, and one wonders what goes on in the minds
of those listeners who crowd to the evenings that are given up to Wagner alone or to
Bach, Beethoven, and Mozart. It is on a Wagner night that one begins to be conscious
of how badly the band is playing. They are trotting through the old stock extracts,
which they are supposed to know by heart. The old hands are bored to death, the new
ones do not yet know their way about. At least so one is tempted to think for the
moment. And on a classical night one is tempted to quarrel with some of Sir Henry
Wood's interpretations.</p>

<p>Such judgments are unprofitable, even if one could be sure that they were true.
It is the homogeneous programme that alters one's critical angle. The last new versification
of a suburban house-agent's advertisement in the second half of the programme
restores a juster balance. To judge from old Promenade programmes, the "one-style"
night must be a relic of earlier tradition. When Mr. Robert Newman first started the
concerts, in 1895, there would be a Scottish night, an Irish night, a Military night, and,
besides a Wagner night, a Gounod night. The Irish night meant a programme of
Stanford, Balfe, Wallace and Sullivan. Sullivan still figures in our programmes; the
others have dropped out, and so has the Gounod night. The programme of a Military
night does indeed seem a curiosity to-day. Here it is: <i>Military March</i> (Schubert),
overture <i>Les Dragons de Villars</i> (Maillart), <i>The German Patrol</i> (Eilenberg), <i>Trumpet
Overture</i> (Mendelssohn), <i>The Red Hussar</i> (Solomon), <i>The British Army Quadrilles</i>
(Jullien), <i>The Drum Polka</i> (Anonymous), and the "Soldiers' Chorus" from <i>Faust</i>.
Maillart's overture still figures in this year's list; but probably no one wants a military
programme in these days, even if it were made up from the classics. It is interesting
to note that what we called a "Popular" night differed very little from the Saturday
programmes of this year, in spite of the number of novelties that have in the course
of time been gradually added to the repertory. The operatic selections were dropped
a long time ago, but such things as Handel's <i>Largo</i>, Grieg's <i>Peer Gynt</i>, the overture to
<i>William Tell</i>, and Bizet's <i>L'Arlésienne</i> have probably been played once or even twice
in every season.</p>

<p>The book of programmes may be regarded as a fair index of average taste, and as
such is instructive. English people, on the whole, have had too much common sense
to allow their musical interests to be distorted by the war. It is true that modern
German music is no longer heard, and that the names of modern French, Russian,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
and Italian composers figure largely on the programmes. But it is probably also true
that the accident of the war has merely helped to consolidate a tendency that was
apparent some time before. Brahms was never a composer for the man in the street.
What the ordinary man wants in music is a clear-cut tune, a vigorous rhythm, and an
exciting volume of sound. He gets these in <i>William Tell</i> and <i>L'Arlésienne</i>. In the
presence of these and other old favourites we are all ordinary men. They are the things
which the man in the street enjoys at a first hearing, the things which the cultivated
musician never ceases to enjoy. It is through such music that the average man has
gradually learned to enjoy Beethoven's Symphonies and the Brandenburg Concertos, for
they too possess those essential qualities.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is a very large section of the public which demands a more
sensuous and emotional type of music. The emotion which these people seek is not
necessarily erotic, nor is it consciously religious, though the prelude to <i>Tristan</i> and
Handel's <i>Largo</i> (with harp and organ) are among the works which appeal to them
most. It was they who made the popularity of Tchaikovsky and Richard Strauss, and
it is they who will establish the popularity of Scriabin. Together with this desire for
sensuous emotion there is often combined a delight in curious and amusing orchestral
effects. This was another factor in the enjoyment of Strauss, and it can be satisfied
not only in such works as Scriabin's <i>Prometheus</i>, but in Sir Henry Wood's ingenious
orchestral transcriptions of Moussorgsky. Brahms has always been too difficult of
understanding for the <i>William Tell</i> public, and too austere for what one may call the
"wallowers." He is hardly a composer for the Promenade Concerts at all; the <i>Requiem</i>,
the chamber music, and the songs are his best works, and those can always be heard
in their proper places.</p>

<p>The complaint is frequently made that the music of the modern English composers is
crowded out, not so much by foreign contemporaries as by the classics. New works
by English composers are played once, it is said, but never again. Yet even if we leave
out Elgar, as being a classic as surely established as Saint-Saëns, there are several
English works which are played over and over again. Sullivan's <i>In Memoriam</i> is one of
those which might well be laid on the shelf; but like Walford Davies' <i>Solemn Melody</i>
it brings in the organ, and to many English people music of this kind would appear to
offer all the spiritual advantages of church-going without its discomforts, intellectual
or physical. Besides these there are Mackenzie's <i>Benedictus</i> and Edward German's
<i>Henry VIII.</i> dances, as well as various pieces by Balfour Gardiner and Percy Grainger,
which undoubtedly possess those desirable qualities of tune, rhythm, and a jolly noise.
In one case Sir Henry Wood has managed to add the attractions both of organ and
<i>batterie de cuisine</i>, thus combining mirth with devotion.</p>

<p>It is perhaps because a Promenade audience is so kind and so undiscriminating that
these concerts have become the recognized trial ground for new works. This year's
novelties have been, on the whole, of little interest. Malipiero's second set of <i>Impressioni
dal Vero</i> was the most original, Roger Quilter's <i>Children's Overture</i> the most attractive.</p>

<p>The want of discrimination shown by the audience is most apparent in the case of
the vocal and instrumental soloists. A few years ago, it is related, the students of the
Paris Conservatoire used to make a hostile demonstration against every concerto on
the ground that the concerto was of its nature a bad form of art. There are indeed a fair
number of musicians in this country who in private conversation will confess to much
the same opinion. Generally, however, if pressed, they will make four or five exceptions,
such as the favourite concertos of Mozart and Beethoven, together with Schumann's
and the B flat concerto of Brahms. As regards the rest, they at least afford proof of the
good manners inculcated at our music schools. The more recent ones, such as those of
Rachmaninov and Tcherepnin, are no better than the others. That of Delius alone
stands out as a work of real beauty. The real disfigurement of the Promenade Concerts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
is provided by the singers. One might have supposed that a public which had enjoyed
a <i>scena</i> of Wagner or Verdi would refuse to tolerate the vapid domesticities of the second
half of the programme. But, alas! it is probably this very domesticity that evokes the
applause. The promenaders will admire Isolde's Death Scene or <i>Eri tu</i>, but they must
worship at a distance. When they hear the other stuff they know that it is something
which they themselves can sing successfully in their own suburban drawing-rooms.
Sir Henry Wood was once heard to express the hope that some day there might be a
Promenade Concert in London every night of the year. Could that hope ever be realized
it would be the noblest monument to the man who for our generation at least has
created the Promenade Concerts. But must there always be those songs? They are
symbols of bondage to commercial interests.</p>

<p>After five years of absence Busoni has returned to England, and his recital at the
Wigmore Hall on October 15th showed that his playing has lost none of its former
strength and vitality, whilst it has undoubtedly gained in dignity and serenity. His
audience consisted mainly of musicians, and his programme was evidently intended for
serious and cultivated listeners. He began with the first prelude and fugue from Bach's
<i>Forty-Eight</i>, producing a wonderful effect at the end of the fugue by a continuous haze
of pedal, through which the counterpoint yet stood out with perfect clearness. His
reading of the <i>Goldberg Variations</i> was startling, both in its quality of tone and in its
departures from the text. But it was clear that there was a considered reason for everything
that was done, and as a commentary on Bach the performance was of singular
interest. Busoni was at his best in Beethoven's <i>Hammerklaviev</i> sonata. It is probably
the most difficult work in all the literature of the pianoforte. When Busoni plays one
does not take technical difficulties into account; but this sonata is both supremely
difficult to understand and supremely difficult to interpret to an audience. To grasp its
vastness of conception and to present it without the least appearance of struggle in
perfect balance of poetry and philosophy is a task which Busoni alone of living pianists
can accomplish. It was evident from the behaviour of the audience after the end of the
sonata that they all realised how in comparison with Busoni most other pianists, despite
their admirable qualities, are very small fry.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDITORIAL NOTES</h2>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">OUR</span> last notes in this place were written "in the dark." We sketched,
in a general way, our attitude, our intentions, and our hopes whilst
we were still without more evidence than our private enquiries
could produce as to the degree of confidence that our proposals
would inspire and the amount of support that we should receive. We are
now more fully informed; and we may honestly say that, although our
expectations were not, perhaps, coloured by an excessive diffidence, they
have been more than realised.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The extraordinarily cordial reception given us, both by critics in the
Press and by our readers, has proved that there is a demand for a paper on
the lines which we have laid down, and that our first number was regarded
as a satisfactory beginning. We must express our profound gratitude to
those&mdash;there are hundreds&mdash;who have written to us in terms of unqualified
appreciation and benevolence, and to the reviewers, whose kindness is more
encouraging than they probably know. It now remains for us to attempt to
live up to the promises we have made.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>One more thing we must add before we turn to detail. Editors do not
normally discuss the economics of their enterprises in public, and nobody
wishes that they should. But before the <span class="smcap">London Mercury</span> appeared,
we made a special effort to start it on a firm basis by securing a large number
of Original Subscribers. That effort was remarkably successful; thousands
of persons subscribed for a year before they had seen a copy of the
paper. These proved by their willingness to buy a pig in a poke that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
they were thoroughly interested in our scheme; and we are entitled to
assume that they will be interested to hear that our initial success has been
so great that our immediate future is securely guaranteed. In other words
(though much ground remains to be won), we have been spared the wearing
and worrying struggle to obtain a position and a "hearing" which so often
embarrasses literary and artistic periodicals. A direct result of this is that we
shall be under no necessity to experiment hastily, but shall be able to give
due consideration to every possible development that occurs to us. A direct
implication of it is that should we, in the long run, fail to satisfy the public,
we should have nothing and nobody but ourselves to blame. Either our
conception would have been proved unpopular or our execution would have
been deemed inadequate. It is the most comfortable of situations. That is
all we need say on the subject. We have spoken frankly about it (rather than
affect an impassive indifference) simply because we think our readers would
like us to do so.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>We have as yet received no great number of detailed criticisms or
suggestions for improvement. But there have been some, both in the
Press and in the letters from our correspondents. Some of the suggestions
that have been made we shall adopt; some we shall not; one or
two of the most interesting are based on a misunderstanding. The most
noticeable of these derive from the notion that the <span class="smcap">London Mercury</span>
was intended to be an exact analogue of the <i>Mercure de France</i>, and
borrowed its title from that excellent paper. We may as well explain, once
and for all, that the similitude with the <i>Mercure de France</i>, happy though it
may be, was reached by accident; our own title was derived directly from
the Mercuries which were the earliest products of the English periodical
Press; and for our scheme we are indebted to no paper, British or foreign.
A Scottish critic observes that "Belgian literature owed its notable capture of
Europe largely to its [the <i>Mercure's</i>] whole-hearted welcome, and the new
movement in Germany associated with the names of Rilke and Zweig
found its first foreign recognition in its pages. Moreover, it surveyed the
whole field of human intellectual achievement&mdash;philosophy, science, religion&mdash;in
its articles.... The name of M. Davray at the foot of a <i>Mercure</i>
article has made more than one British writer's reputation in Paris, and
Europe would have been entirely ignorant that there was a new and rich
literature in Spanish-America had not the <i>Mercure</i> discovered it and
blazoned forth its merits." We might, if we would, make some remark on the
detail of this. Rilke is not a major poet; Zweig is an unimportant, over-exuberant
critic who tried, in vain, to persuade the late Emile Verhaeren
that he was a German; the fame of Spanish-American literature, trumpeted
though it may have been by the <i>Mercure</i>, has not yet reached London.
But we prefer to concentrate on the more important point, and that is that
our functions, as we conceive them, are not those of the <i>Mercure de France</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
We have already published letters from French and American correspondents;
we shall shortly publish letters from Italian, Russian, and
German correspondents; we shall from time to time publish fuller
articles about recent developments in foreign countries. But there <i>are</i> certain
limits to our space, and there <i>is</i> a centre in our plans. It is an admirable
thing to disseminate the works of good Belgian and Spanish-American
authors, and we hope that we shall not overlook anything really important
that comes from any quarter of the globe. But our principal object is to
assist people to read the good English authors of the past, and to stimulate
the popularity of good English authors of the present. There are those to
whom any foreigner, writing in some mysteriously wonderful language,
like French or Polish or Spanish-American, is a portent; but we are not
amongst them. We desire to keep the British public in touch with all foreign
developments that may be considered likely to be of special interest to the
British public; but we certainly do not intend to devote to the study of
foreign authors space that might more profitably be given to the examination
of a dead or living man who has written in our own tongue. The <i>Mercure</i>
bestows a great deal of attention on foreign authors; it publishes political
articles; it concerns itself largely with problems of philosophy and religion.
Some of these questions will be ignored by the <span class="smcap">London Mercury</span>. Some
it will discuss; regarding some its functions will be purely that of a
recorder. But it does not propose to deflect from its original purpose, which
was to publish the best contemporary "creative work" that it could obtain,
to criticise new books and old, and to minister to the other needs of the
British reader and the British book-collector. It is just as well that this
should be clear.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>In the present number one or two slight changes are to be observed.
There is a minor, but not insignificant, typographical change, and two new,
and we hope welcome, "features" have been added. These had already
been premeditated, but we made them with all the more satisfaction in that
several correspondents had recommended&mdash;we had almost said demanded&mdash;them.
We hope, in an early issue, to add to these a section on Architecture,
similar to the sections on Art, Music, and the Theatre.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Several correspondents have written to ask us whether we propose to
devote any attention to the economics of authorship, and two of them
(persons whom we conceive to have a direct and immediate interest in the
subject) make special reference to the question of American copyright.
To all of them we can reply that, although economics in general, like politics
in general, come within the sphere of our self-abnegation, we shall throw
what light we can on the economics of authorship, just as we shall hold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
ourselves free to trespass on politics when politics touch art. American copyright,
as a fact, we had already marked out as one of the matters to which
we intend to return again and again until America puts her laws straight.
The British copyright laws are now, so far as they affect the author, on a
very satisfactory footing. The principal countries of the world have signed
the Berne Convention, and even Russia, had there been no Revolution,
would by this time have agreed that the works of British authors should be
automatically copyrighted in Russia. The more widely the civilised custom
spreads the more glaring becomes what, without offence, we may call the
offence of America. There only&mdash;and it is the largest English-speaking and
English-reading community in the world&mdash;is the British author defenceless,
there only may he be robbed with impunity of the fruits of his labour.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Let us recapitulate the elements of the American copyright law as they
at present stand. Copyright in America is defined by a law of 1909. That
Act lays down that a book, to secure legal protection, must be manufactured
in the United States of America; the stipulation was carried on from an
earlier statute. A book published in the English language may obtain
interim protection for one month from the date of publication if a copy is
forwarded to an office in Washington; but at the end of the month protection
lapses. Copyright is lost unless a book (or a newspaper contribution) has
been "set up" in the States and issued there within a month of its publication
in Great Britain.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Now we have no hesitation in describing the present copyright arrangements
as between England and America as immoral and unjust. They do
not greatly handicap authors of international reputation, so far as their new
books are concerned. If&mdash;he will forgive us for using his name as an
illustration&mdash;Mr. Rudyard Kipling has written a new book, he will have no
difficulty whatever in getting an American publisher to put it into type in
America and issue it at a date approximate to that of the English publication.
But even the eminent and the "arrived" are put to some trouble and
expense by the necessity of "securing copyright," and on those who are
not so eminent the law presses very hardly indeed. There are famous
English authors whose early books are not copyright in America; there are
young English authors who have to go through the anguish of seeing
American copyright expire whilst some American publisher is debating
whether or not he shall take "sheets" of a book from England; and "first
books" of any character published in England can virtually never be copyrighted
in America. It may, and should, be granted that as a body American
publishers are more just and generous than their laws. We know of many
cases in which the English authors of non-copyright books have obtained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
from American publishers precisely the same royalties as they have obtained
from their English publishers. We know also of cases&mdash;relatively few, we
gladly admit&mdash;in which the works of English authors have been pirated by
American editors and publishers without sanction, thanks, or payment.
But the mere fact that in most instances American publishers are ashamed
to take advantage of the law, and that in other instances they do the handsome
thing in order to secure "favours to come," is no palliation of the law.
It is a harsh and a selfish law; a law unworthy of a great nation, a nation
which is second to none in its professions and in its intentions with regard
to the welfare of humanity at large.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The state of the law is commonly ascribed to the typographical unions.
"Protection for Printers": books should have no rights in America unless
American typographers have been employed upon them. Beneath this
argument lies the naked, brutal fact that at present, America having not yet
produced the great universal literature that she is destined to produce,
America imports much more from us than we do from her. If "sheets"
were copyright, whenever sent, we should get the better of the exchange;
we produce ten Masefields for one O. Henry, and England would print far
more for America than America would for England. This may determine the
printers' attitude; though even the printers might realise that a time might
come when the boot would be on the other leg, and British publishers will
be in a position to squeeze American authors to any extent, and British
printers will insist on printing books which might more conveniently and
economically be printed in America. But surely, in a matter like this, the
law ought not to be dictated by the selfish and shortsighted conceptions
of a trade. We have never met an English author who has had, or who
has contemplated, relations with America who has not been bitterly
contemptuous of the American attitude towards the copyright law. We have
never spoken to an American author or publisher who has not admitted
that it was a disgrace to America. Authors may be a small body, but
they are as entitled to their rights as anybody else; these, also, are God's
creatures. President Wilson himself, for all we know, may under the present
regime have lost English copyright in his early works; and the irony of the
law is that it presses most hardly on those who have still their fortunes to
make, for the celebrated, or their agents, can successfully cope with it.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>These lines will, as we are happy to know, meet the eyes of many
Americans who write and many who do not. We appeal to them to agitate
for a change in their law. That the American copyright law should be placed
on precisely the same basis as the English copyright law we do not ask, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
have no right to ask. But that English authors should automatically enjoy
in the United States the same privileges as are enjoyed by native authors
is a reasonable proposition. Cannot somebody move the Legislature?</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>We shall return to this subject at greater length. Meanwhile, if we
may hark back for a moment to the point from which our digression
started, may we say that we shall welcome any suggestions our readers
may make as to the development of the paper within the limits we have
defined? Particularly we desire to hear&mdash;though we should not be human
if we pretended to enjoy&mdash;objections, provided they are conceived in a
friendly spirit, to anything in our present arrangements which may strike
readers as unsatisfactory. It was another god who sprang, perfect and in
full panoply, from the head of Jove.</p>

<h2>LITERARY INTELLIGENCE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> death of Mr. Bruce Cummings on October 22nd, at the age of thirty,
brought to an end a literary career which was singular alike in its character
and in its brevity. He did not expect to live to see the publication of his
book, <i>The Journal of a Disappointed Man</i>, and himself inserted the last and
the only falsity in it, except the name he gave himself: "Barbellion died
on December 31st." But he did actually witness its remarkable success on its appearance
in the early part of this year; and it is impossible not to feel that this must, to some
extent, have alleviated his disappointment. He was remarkable, not only in his
personality and his gifts, but also in the fact that he was fully and frankly conscious,
at all events for some years before his death, that his journal would be published
and would be examined as a literary composition. He compared it with the journals
which were already famous, he speculated on the reception it would have, he
experienced a thrill in discovering a sister-soul in Marie Bashkirtseff. And it is
hardly doubtful that his expectations will be realised. His career was one of
struggle under almost overwhelming difficulties. His earliest ambition was to be
a naturalist; and without training or assistance of any kind he had almost achieved
it, when the breakdown of his father compelled him to earn a more substantial,
though still meagre, living as a reporter on the staff of a provincial newspaper.
He struggled out of this pit, and eventually succeeded in obtaining a position at
South Kensington, which, in view of the obstacles in his way, was an extraordinary
performance. Through all this battle against odds he was handicapped by an ill-health
which seems to have affected almost every organ in his body&mdash;a weak heart,
susceptible, if not actually tubercular, lungs, dyspepsia, and disordered nerves; and
these ailments were accompanied and intensified by a perpetual brooding over his
health which, had it had no basis, might have been called acute hypochondria. But it
was only after his marriage that he discovered, by a dramatic and extraordinary accident,
that he was already condemned to death by a more terrible malady than any of these.
Under the rapidly-approaching shadow of this end, he continued his work and his
journal as long as his strength permitted, and survived, though but for a little and in a
state of complete collapse, the success which had been so persistently denied him before.
His journal tells an extraordinary story and reveals an extraordinary person. Its confessions
are frank, quiet, and obviously truthful; and neither his introspective habit of
mind nor his belief that his journal would be published seems ever to have vitiated his
powers of observation and notation. But he was something more than a remarkable
personality and a veracious reporter of himself. He was also a writer and a critic of
great ability. His notes on literature and music, here and there through the diary,
show considerable penetration and judgment; and his descriptions of persons and
places are vivid, fascinating, and often humorous. A volume of his remains has
just been issued under the title, <i>Enjoying Life, and Other Essays</i>; and this includes the
paper on the great journal-writers to which he alludes more than once in his diary.</p>

<p>As a token of their admiration for a master in their craft, a number of poets recently
united to make a presentation to Mr. Thomas Hardy, O.M., on the occasion of his
entering his eightieth year. Their tribute took the form of a manuscript volume in
which each of the poets wrote one of his own pieces and which was prefaced by an
address written, it is understood, by the Poet Laureate, with whom are joined in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
volume the Hon. Maurice Baring, Mr. Hilaire Belloc, Mr. Laurence Binyon, Mr. G. K.
Chesterton, Mr. W. H. Davies, Mr. Walter de la Mare, Mr. Austin Dobson, Mr.
Edmund Gosse, Mr. Maurice Hewlett, Mr. Ralph Hodgson, Mr. A. E. Housman,
Mr. Rudyard Kipling, Mr. John Masefield, Mrs. Alice Meynell, Mr. Sturge Moore,
Professor Gilbert Murray, Sir Henry Newbolt, Mr. Alfred Noyes, Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch,
Mr. G. W. Russell ("A. E."), Mr. Arthur Symons, Mr. Herbert Trench, Sir
William Watson, Mr. W. B. Yeats, and many of their younger fellows. A sentence from
the address, "We would thank you for the pleasure and increasing delight that your art
has given us," explains the purpose of the gift and supplies a text on which a discourse
might be pronounced. For if it is a delight for an established master to receive the
homage of his juniors, it should be, and is, an especial delight for them to be able to
offer it. We think it probable that some of the younger contributors to this volume will
live to remember with wonder and gratitude the fact that they were able, while he still
lived, to express their gratitude to one of the greatest of modern English poets.</p>

<p>Mr. Edmund Gosse, the doyen of English critics, celebrated his seventieth birthday
in September, and, through Lord Crewe, a presentation was made to him accompanied
by a memorial of almost unexampled length and distinction. Each of the signatories has
since received a beautifully printed "memento." Those who saw Mr. Gosse's paper
on George Eliot will not need to be told that his powers seem, if anything, to increase
with age. Great and diverse as have been his services to literature since his first book
was (when he was in his early twenties) published, his finest work, both "original" and
critical, has appeared in recent years; and it is easily conceivable that the decade between
his seventieth and his eightieth birthdays will be his most productive. A man of letters
can be paid no higher compliment: Mr. Gosse has retained, and will retain to the end,
the energy and the freshness of youth, whilst his knowledge and experience, in the
natural course of things, broaden and deepen.</p>

<p>The death of Leonid Andreef removes the most savage pessimist of all the pessimists
who have come out of modern Russia. But the author of <i>The Life of Man</i>, <i>The Seven
that Were Hanged</i>, and <i>The Red Laugh</i> was not a pessimist for pessimism's sake: he
suffered and he expressed his suffering sincerely. One of his short stories&mdash;that which
tells of a student and his girl who were overtaken by a band of ruffians in a wood&mdash;is
perhaps the most ghastly story that has ever been written; yet the most revolted reader
could not suppose that the author had been less revolted than himself. Andreef had
refused enormous offers to work for the Bolsheviks, and died, in great poverty, from
shock induced by a rain of Bolshevik bombs near his house.</p>

<h2>MISADVENTURES</h2>

<p class="center">By L. PEARSALL SMITH</p>

<h3><i>At Solemn Music</i></h3>

<p class="drop-cap1"><span class="smcap1">I SAT</span> there, hating the exuberance of her bust and her high-coloured
wig. And how could I listen to the music in the close proximity of
those loud stockings?</p>

<p>Then our eyes met: in both of us the enchanted chord was touched;
we both looked through the same window into Heaven. In that moment of
musical, shared delight&mdash;these awful things will happen&mdash;our souls joined
hands and sang like the morning stars together.</p>

<h3><i>The Platitude</i></h3>

<p>"It's after all, the little things in life that really matter!" I exclaimed,
to my own surprise and the general consternation. I was as much chagrined
as they were flabbergasted by this involuntary outbreak; but from my
reading of the Chinese mystics, and from much practice in crowded railway
carriages, I have become expert in that Taoist art of disintegration which
Yen Hui described to Confucius as the art of "sitting and forgetting."
I have learnt to lay aside my personality in awkward moments, to dissolve
this self of mine into the All Pervading; to fall back, in fact, into the universal
flux, and sit, as I now sat there, a blameless lump of matter, rolled on,
according to the heaven's rolling, inert and unconcerned, with rocks and
stones and trees.</p>

<h3><i>The Communion of Souls</i></h3>

<p>"So of course I bought it! How could I help buying it?" Then lifting
the conversation, as with Lady Hyslop one always lifts it, to a higher level,
"This notion of free will," I went on, "the notion, for instance, that I was
free to buy or not to buy that rare edition, seems, when you think of it&mdash;at
least to me it seems&mdash;a wretched notion really. I like to think I must follow
the things of desire as&mdash;how shall I put it?&mdash;as the tide follows the moon;
that my actions are due to necessary causes; that the world inside isn't a
meaningless chaos, but a world of order, like the world outside, governed
by beautiful laws, as the Stars are governed."</p>

<p>"How I love the Stars!" murmured Lady Hyslop. "What things they
say to me! They are the pledges of lost recognitions&mdash;the promise of
ineffable mitigations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
"Mitigations?" I gasped, feeling a little giddy. But it didn't matter:
always when we meet Lady Hyslop and I have the most wonderful conversations.
And is not their greatest charm precisely the fact that neither of us
understands a word the other says?</p>

<h3><i>Disenchantment</i></h3>

<p>Life, I often thought, would be so different if I only had one; but in the
meantime I went on fastening scraps of paper together with pins.</p>

<p>Opalescent, infinitely desirable, tinged with all the rainbow hues of fancy,
inaccessible in the window of a stationer's shop around the corner, gleamed
the paste-pot of my day-dreams. Every day I passed it, but every day some
inhibition paralyzed my will; or my thoughts would be distracted in a golden
dream or splendid disenchantment, some metaphysical perplexity, or giant
preoccupation with the world's woe.</p>

<p>So time rolled on; the seasons followed in each other's footsteps. Empires
rose and fell; and still that paste-pot hung, a dragon-guarded fruit of the
Hesperides, in the window I walked by every day.</p>

<p>Then one morning, one awful morning, my pins gave out. I met this
crisis with manly resolution: I was the master of my fate! Summoning all the
forces of my moral nature, I put on my hat and went calmly out and bought
that paste-pot. I bought three paste-pots, and carried them with me calmly
home. At last the countercharm was found, the spell was broken, and the
Devil finally defeated&mdash;but, oh, at what a cost! In the reaction, which
immediately followed, I sat, facing those pots of nauseating paste, unnerved
and disenchanted, beyond the reach of consolation, with nothing to wait
for now but Death.</p>

<h3><i>The Listener</i></h3>

<p>The topic was one of my favourite topics of conversation, but I didn't
at all feel on this occasion that it was I who was speaking. No, it was the
Truth shining through me; the light of the Revelation which I had been
chosen to proclaim and blazon to the world. No wonder they were all
impressed by my moving tones and gestures; no wonder even the fastidious
lady whom it was most difficult to please kept watching me with almost
ecstatic attention.</p>

<p>As in an eclipse the earth's shadow falls upon the moon, or as a cloud
may obscure the sun in his glory, so a shadow fell, so from some morass of
memory arose a tiny mist of words to darken my mind for a moment. I
brushed them aside: they had no meaning. Sunning myself in the lovely
mirror of those eyes, never, for a moment, could I credit that devil-suggested
explanation of their gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
And anyhow&mdash;thus I laughed away the notion&mdash;how could she do it
anyhow, even if she tried? Other people perhaps&mdash;but me? No, that phrase
I had heard, I had heard, was a nonsense phrase; the words, "She mimics
you to perfection," could be nothing but a bit of unintelligible jabber. For
who can turn the rainbow or the lightning-flash into ridicule, make fun of
the moon's splendour, or mimic the Daystar in his shining?</p>

<h3><i>Shrinkage</i></h3>

<p>Sometimes my soul floats out beyond the constellations, then all the vast
life of the universe is mine. Then again it evaporates, it shrinks, it dwindles,
and of all that flood of thought which over-brimmed the great Cosmos there
is hardly enough now left to fill a teaspoon.</p>

<h3><i>The Lift</i></h3>

<p>What on earth had I come up for? I stood out of breath in my bedroom,
having completely forgotten the errand, which, just as I was going out, had
carried me upstairs, leaping two steps at a time.</p>

<p>Gloves! Of course it was my gloves which I had left there. But what
did gloves matter, I asked myself, in a world bursting with misery, as Dr.
Johnson describes it?</p>

<p>O stars and garters! how bored I am by this trite, moralizing way of
regarding natural phenomena&mdash;this crying of vanity on the beautiful
manifestation of mechanical forces. This desire of mine to appear out of
doors in appropriate apparel, if it can thus defy and overcome the law of
gravitation&mdash;if it can lift twelve stone of matter thirty or forty feet above the
earth's surface; if it can do this every day, and several times a day, and never
get out of order, is it not as remarkable and convenient in the house as
a hydraulic lift?</p>

<h3><i>The Danger of Going to Church</i></h3>

<p>As I came away from the Evening Service, walking home from that Sabbath
adventure, some neighbours of mine passed me in their motor laughing.
Were they laughing at me? I wondered uneasily; and as I sauntered
across the fields I vaguely cursed those misbelievers, remembering some
maledictions from the Prophets, and from the Psalms we had sung that
evening. Yes, yes, their eyes should be darkened, and their lying lips put
to silence. They should be smitten with the botch of Egypt, and a sore botch
in the legs that cannot be healed. All the teeth should be broken in the
mouths of those bloody men and daughters of backsliding; their faces
should become as flames, and their heads be made utterly bald. Their little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
ones should be dashed to pieces before their eyes, and brimstone scattered
upon their habitations. They should be led away with their buttocks
uncovered; they should stagger to and fro as a drunken man staggereth in
his vomit.</p>

<p>But as for the Righteous Man who kept his Sabbaths, his should be the
blessings of those who walk in the right way. "These blessings"&mdash;the words
came back to me from the Evening Lesson&mdash;"these blessings shall come upon
thee and overtake thee." And suddenly, in the mild summer air, it seemed
as if, like a swarm of bees inadvertently wakened, the blessings of the Old
Testament were actually rushing after me. From the hot, remote, passionate
past of Hebrew history, out of the Oriental climate and unctuous lives of
that infuriate people, gross good things were coming to reward me with
benedictions for which I had not bargained. Great oxen and camels and
concubines were panting close behind me, he-goats and she-goats and rams
of the breed of Bashan. My barns should burst their doors with plenty, and
all my paths drop fatness. My face should be smeared with the oil of
rejoicing; all my household and the beasts of my household should beget
and bear increase; and as for the fruit of my own loins, it should be for
multitude as the sands of the sea and as the stars of heaven. My sons and
daughters, and their sons and daughters to the third and fourth generation,
should rise up and call me blessed. My feet should be dipped in butter,
and my eyes stand out with fatness; I should flourish as the Cedar of
Lebanon that bringeth forth fruit in old age.</p>

<p>My Prayer Book began to smoke in my hand from the hot lava embedded
in it; the meadow was scorched by the live coals of cursing and still
more awful benediction I had so thoughtlessly raked out of the church
furnace and brought down in a hot shower on myself and my neighbours.</p>

<h3><i>The Wrong Word</i></h3>

<p>We were talking of the Universe at tea, and one of our company declared
that he at least was entirely without illusions. He had long since faced the
fact that Nature had no sympathy with our hopes and fears, and was
completely indifferent to our fate. The Universe, he said, was a great
mechanism; man, with his reason and moral judgments, was the chance
product of blind forces, which, though they would so soon destroy him,
he must yet despise. To endure this tragedy of our fate with passionless
despair, never to wince or bow the head, to confront a hostile universe with
high disdain, to fix with eyes of scorn the Gorgon face of Destiny, to stand
on the brink of the abyss, hurling defiance at the icy stars&mdash;this, he said,
was his attitude, and it produced, as you can imagine, a very powerful
impression on the company. As for me, I was completely carried away by
my enthusiasm. "By Jove, that is a stunt!" I cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Interruption</i></h3>

<p>"Life," said a gaunt widow, with a reputation for being clever&mdash;"life is
a perpetual toothache."</p>

<p>In this vein the conversation went on: the familiar topics were discussed
of food-restrictions, epidemics, cancer, and so on.</p>

<p>Near me there sat a little old lady who was placidly drinking her tea, and
taking no part in the melancholy chorus. "Well, I must say," she remarked,
turning to me and speaking in an undertone, "I must say I enjoy life."</p>

<p>"So do I," I whispered.</p>

<p>"When I enjoy things," she went on, "I know it. Eating, for instance,
the sunshine, my hot-water bottle at night. Other people are always thinking
of unpleasant things. It makes a difference," she added, as she got up to
go with the others.</p>

<p>"All the difference in the world," I answered.</p>

<p>It's too bad that I had no chance for further conversation with that wise
old lady. I felt that we were congenial spirits, and had a lot to tell each other.
For she and I are not among those who fill the mind with garbage: we make
a better use of that divine and adorable endowment. We invite Thought to
share, and by sharing to enhance, the pleasures of the delicate senses; we
distil, as it were, an elixir from our golden moments, keeping out of the
shining crucible of consciousness everything that tastes sour. I do wish that
we could have discussed at greater length, like two Alchemists, the theory
and practice of our art.</p>

<h3><i>The Rationalist</i></h3>

<p>Occultisms, fairyisms, incantations, glimpses of the Beyond, intimations
from another world&mdash;all kinds of supernaturalisms are most distasteful to
me; I cling to the world of science and common sense and explicable
phenomena; and I was much put out, therefore, to find this morning a
cabalistic inscription written in letters of large menace on my bath-room
floor. TAM HTAB&mdash;what could be the meaning of these cryptic words,
and how on earth had they got there? Like Belshazzar, my eyes were
troubled by this writing, and my knees smote one against the other; till
majestic Reason, deigning to look downward from her contemplation of
eternal causes, spelt backwards for me, with a pitying smile, the homely,
familiar, harmless inscription on the BATH MAT, which was lying there
wrong side up.</p>

<h3><i>Justification</i></h3>

<p>Well, what if I did put it on a little at that luncheon-party? Do I not owe
it to my friends to assert now and then my claims to consideration; ought
I always to allow myself to be trampled on and treated as dirt? And how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
about the Saints and Patriarchs of the Bible? Didn't Joseph tell of the
dream in which his wheatsheaf was exalted, and Deborah sing without
blame how she arose a mother in Israel? And didn't David boast of his
triumph over the paw of the lion and the paw of the bear? Nay, in his
confabulations with His chosen people, does not the Creator of the universe
Himself take every opportunity of impressing on those Hebrews His importance,
His power, His glory?</p>

<p>Was I not made in His image?</p>

<h3><i>Day-dream</i></h3>

<p>"Yes, as you say, life is so full of disappointment, disillusion! More and
more I ask myself, as I grow older, what is the good of it all? We dress,
we go out to dinner," I went on, "but surely we walk in a vain show.
How good this asparagus is! I often think asparagus is the most delicious
of all vegetables. And yet I don't know&mdash;when one thinks of fresh green
peas. One can get tired of asparagus as one can of strawberries&mdash;but tender
green peas and peaches I could eat for ever. And there are certain pears,
too, that taste like heaven. It's one of my favourite day-dreams for my
declining years to live alone, a formal, greedy, selfish old gentleman, in a
square house, say, in Devonshire, with a square garden, whose walls are
covered with apricots and figs and peaches; and there are precious pears,
too, of my own planting, on espaliers along the paths. I shall walk out with a
gold-headed cane in the autumn sunshine, and just at the right moment
pick a delicious pear. However, that isn't at all what I was going to say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<h2>EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY POETRY</h2>

<p class="center">By GEORGE SAINTSBURY</p>

<p class="center">(<i>A paper based on, but not identical with, a discourse delivered at what may be
called the headquarters of the subject&mdash;the Pump Room, Bath, October 1st, 1919</i>)</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> effect of convincing anyone against his will is sufficiently
familiar, but it may be questioned whether there is not another
state of mind which is still more insusceptible of real conviction,
which it is still more of a labour of Sisyphus to convince. In
this state there is too much mere inertia for the word "will"
to come in. There is no intention of relapsing into the same opinion; there
is indeed no need of any, for the opinion is never disturbed. The attempts
at convincing need not be resisted or contemned; they may even be listened
to and enjoyed like a very pleasant song, but they are at once forgotten.</p>

<p>Something of this sort, it may be feared, is the case with the subject of
this present paper. People have made up their minds that there was <i>no</i>
eighteenth-century poetry or, at best, that such as there was was not properly
eighteenth-century poetry at all, but merely a survival or an anticipation.
The present writer had a perhaps accidental but certainly curious illustration
of the fact in reference to the origin of this very paper; for having
expressed his intention of discussing "eighteenth-century <i>poetry</i>," he found
the subject announced at first as "eighteenth-century <i>verse</i>." In face of
such a popular attitude&mdash;let us be bold and give it its proper name: such a
vulgar error&mdash;it may not be quite idle to make a fresh attempt against it.
I am not sure that in some of the versions of the Pagan Apocrypha it is not
recorded that Sisyphus <i>did</i> get that stone lodged at last. At any rate it is
worth trying, even at the risk, which is almost a certainty, of the very illogical
suspicion that if you like eighteenth-century poetry, you <i>don't</i> like&mdash;or don't
sufficiently understand&mdash;seventeenth and nineteenth. On that point the
present writer may, he thinks, slap his sword home and decline duello
with any man. But he will take the liberty firstly, in order to confine the
matter within reasonable limits, of leaving Pope almost entirely out.
Obviously the famous and much-argued question, "Was Pope a poet?"
can be answered, even in the negative, without deciding our general
point here.</p>

<p>There is, of course&mdash;the fact has been already admitted by glance&mdash;a
division of the poetry of 1700&ndash;1800 to which, in a more or less grudging way,
the poetical franchise is generally granted. Scraps of Lady Winchilsea and
Parnell quite early; Dyer and Thomson at the beginning of the second
quarter; Collins and Gray in the middle; Blake and Burns and Chatterton
if not also Cowper and Crabbe, in the last division are admitted, if only to
a sort of provincial or proselyte membership. Gray, indeed, has always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
been granted special grace, even, as some think, to an unfair comparative
extent, and perhaps Mr. Swinburne's exuberant championship was never
less wasted than in the cases of Collins and Blake. But Blake really does
belong to no time at all except in a few fragments, and most of the others are
too well known for further comment. Let us in the very limited space here
available, before passing to other aspects of the subject, take two poems,
one of the earlier, one of the later time, as examples of pure poetry charged
with special eighteenth-century difference&mdash;for that is the point at issue.
They shall be Dyer's <i>Grongar Hill</i> and Mrs. Greville's <i>Prayer for Indifference</i>.
The one is a picture of that external nature to which as a rule the century is
supposed to have been blind, yet charged with an "inwardness" to which
that century is equally supposed to have been callous. The other is a poem
of mood, almost a pathological poem, possessing the same inwardness, but
charged with a flutter of feeling, again supposed to be quite unknown to the
age of prose and sense. Both are curious examples of what is called the
conventional phraseology of the time, flushed and animated by something
additional&mdash;a characteristic which also appears in Collins, but is more
disputable in Gray, save perhaps in the remarkable "Vicissitude" ode.
<i>Grongar Hill</i> ought to be given whole, but it is not difficult of access; the
"Hymn" is not so easy to get at, but it suffers less from "sampling."</p>

<p>There is not the slightest extravagance, from any catholic point of view
over poetry, in calling <i>Grongar Hill</i> simply beautiful. I think it deserves
that term better than anything of Gray's, though not perhaps quite so well
as some things of Collins's in the first half of the century; while nothing
outside them can touch it, and it came before both. Its attractions, to a
somewhat close student, are manifold, not the least of them being the
fashion in which, for the first time since Milton, and in a way not directly
imitated even from him, it moulds the couplet of mixed eight and seven
syllable lines. But one need not neglect the late Mr. Lowell's remark that
when Edgar Poe talked of iambs and pentameters he made other people
d&mdash;&mdash;n metres. The poem has plenty of other attractions for the most
untechnical reader. Dyer, who was himself a painter, invokes the Muse of
Painting as well as Her of Poetry, and it is really remarkable how, at this
time when hardly anybody is supposed to have had his eye on nature
except Thomson, and in the very year of <i>Winter</i> itself, full eighty, too,
before Scott provoked from Pitt his famous surprise that verse should
be able to express the effect of painting&mdash;how visual as well as audible
effect is produced. The exordium to the</p>

<p class="in0">with the finale to Peace and Quiet, close allied to Pleasure&mdash;all these and all
the rest of the 150 lines or so of the poem have their own appropriate
agreeableness. And it will be very dangerous for anyone to try the usual
sneer at eighteenth-century convention, lest haply he be thought to be
blinded or hoodwinked by conventions of another sort. He has, for instance,
been taught to think "wanton Zephyr" very bad. But has he quite realised
the simplicity and perfection with which the single word "sings" distinctively
characterises the rush of the wind aloft, and the next line brings before the
mind's senses the flowers and crops and woods, from which the "perfume"
is derived below? Is "unbounded," in the particular and yet fully legitimate
sense, quite what Edmond de Goncourt used disdainfully to call "everybody's
epithet" for the apparently limitless freedom of the birds' flight? Without
quoting the whole piece it would be impossible to show the singular
uniformity of pictorial and musical skill which distinguishes it; but this
can be left, with complete security of mind, to anyone who gives it an
impartial reading to discover for himself. Even the impartial reader is not
recommended to proceed from <i>Grongar Hill</i> to <i>The Ruins of Rome</i>, as the
poet in this latter piece most unwisely invites him to do&mdash;still less to <i>The
Fleece</i>. But no attempt is being made here to prove that the eighteenth
century never produced bad poetry: one merely endeavours to point out
that it sometimes produced good.</p>

<p>The <i>Prayer for Indifference</i> is much less varied in kind, and much more
limited in degree, of attraction, but it is perhaps subtler. The personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
application of it can escape no reader of Fanny Burney's Diaries, but is
not necessary to appreciation. The idea is that of an appeal to Oberon for
a "balm" slightly different from that which plays so important a part in
<i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>&mdash;a spell causing neither love nor hate, but
only indifference. The metre is ordinary ballad or common measure; the
language not very different from the ordinary poetic diction of the time.
You are not, as in <i>Grongar Hill</i>, made to believe that you are not in the
eighteenth century at all, or, if at all, as far from its usual and central ways
and thoughts as Grongar itself was and is from London. But, by a quaint and
pleasing paradox, the suppliant infuses into her prayer qualities which were
the very opposite of that which she prays for, and which in a certain sense
might be said to be the quality of the century itself at least on the common
estimate. Indifference&mdash;in the sense of abstinence from enthusiasm&mdash;certainly
<i>was</i> affected by many, and positively approved by some, in those
days. But when the lady says:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I ask no kind return in love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No tempting charm to please&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the heart such gifts remove<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That sighs for peace and ease,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">there is a quiver in verse and phrase and sense alike which indicates and
expresses very effectively aspirations quite different from indifference.
And the quiver becomes a throb, emphasised by the repetition of that
potent word "far," as she goes on:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor ease, nor peace that heart can know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That, like the needle true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns at the touch of joy or woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, turning, trembles too.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far as distress the soul can wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Tis pain in each degree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis bliss, but to a certain bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beyond, 'tis agony.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">And there is not much less real passion, though the expression has become
ironic instead of direct, in the concluding stanza:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And what of life remains to me<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll pass in sober ease:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Half-pleased, contented I will be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Content but half to please.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Now it is probably hopeless to expect readers who have been thoroughly
broken to other styles of poetry themselves to be contented, to be even
"half-pleased" with this. The metre will seem to them jog-trot, the
language hopelessly prosaic, the expression, as Nietzsche says of John Stuart
Mill, "offensively clear"; the absence of any attempt at elaborate ornament
or elaborate ugliness almost more offensive still. And it may also seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
idle boasting or sheer mendacity to observe that there are people who
delight in intricate versification, who love even metaphysical ambiguousness
and obscurity; people for whom Blake is not too uncommonplace or
Rossetti too flamboyant, or&mdash;to come to more recent days, while keeping
to the equal waters of the dead&mdash;Mary Coleridge too problematic, who
yet can enjoy this verse very much indeed, and feel that, having known it,
they could not do without it, which some have held to be the great test
of poetry. Indeed, to them, not the least interesting point about it is that it
<i>does</i> take the form and colour of the time to so large an extent and vindicates
its indispensableness thereby. On the other hand, if anyone says, "But
I do not perceive the quiver, or feel the throb of which you talk," why, of
course, there is nothing more to be done or said. For that person Mrs.
Greville's work is undoubtedly not poetry. But whether his or her state
is the more gracious, because of the fact, is a further question, though one
on which we need not enter. The whole purport of this paper is once more
to make an effort to establish the old position that there are many mansions
in the Heaven of Poetry, and that the mere fact that some one does not
care to live in or to recognise the existence of this or that among them
does not prove that they ought to be pulled down or that they do not exist
at all.</p>

<p>It may, however, be admitted&mdash;in fact no admission or confession is
required, no idea of contesting or denying having been entertained&mdash;that
neither the qualities of <i>Grongar Hill</i> nor those of the <i>Prayer</i>, that still less
the general characteristics of the group of romantic precursors from Collins
to Blake distinguish eighteenth-century poetry generally. And it may in
the same way be further allowed that some of the actual characteristics
of this poetry in general are not <i>strictly</i> poetic at all. Its didacticism is
perhaps the chief of these; but there are undoubtedly others. And we are
busy not with what is not poetical in eighteenth-century verse, but with
what is poetical in eighteenth-century poetry. There are two departments
in which it is almost pre-eminent, in which it is certainly very distinguished.
The strict poeticalness of both of them has indeed been denied by
extremists. All of us probably have heard it said, perhaps some of us have
said it ourselves, that rhetoric is not poetry; and (though here there may
not have been so much agreement) that "light" verse, whether regularly
satiric or not, is at best poetry by allowance and, short of the best, not
poetry at all. Now undoubtedly some rhetoric is not poetry, and a good
deal of light verse is poetry only by extremely generous allowance. But
the complete ostracising of either kind from the poetical city involves
two propositions which are contentious in the extreme, and which I and
those who think with me hold to be abominable heresies. The one is that
"All depends on the subject" in poetry, and the other is that "Verse is
not an essential feature of poetry." <i>We</i> maintain that anything can be treated
poetically, though some things are very rebellious to such treatment, and
that though rhetoric is strictly a characteristic of prose, it cam be, so to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
speak, super-saturated with poetry when it adopts poetical form, the same
contention extending to the subjects of satiric or of merely light verse. A
great deal of the abundant rhetorical verse of the eighteenth century is no
doubt not poetry, or not very poetical poetry, and a good deal of its abundant
satire, not a very little of its <i>vers de société</i> and trifles is not poetry or not
very poetical. But, on the other hand, not a very little of both kinds is poetry,
and the reason and origin of its poetical character are by no means uninteresting
to trace. There is no room, and indeed not much occasion, to do
this at length here. Suffice it to say that for its rhetorical verse the
century was very much indebted to Dryden, and that for its light verse
it was still more indebted to Prior.</p>

<p>The positions of the two were indeed different, for Dryden was a dead
man when the century opened, though he had died on its very eve, while
Prior was an actual member of its first great literary group. And, further,
Dryden's influence, though it continued to some extent directly through
the whole time, was largely exercised at second-hand through Pope, while
Prior's was first-hand all through. For which reasons we need not say
anything more here on Dryden himself, while we must say something on
Prior. But the rhetorical influence which had produced such great poetry
(for great it is, let who will gainsay) as the finest passages of Dryden's satires,
the opening of <i>Religio Laici</i>, the "wandering fires" paragraph in <i>The Hind
and the Panther</i>, and not a few things in the neglected plays, was well
justified of its children in the following century. I have never seen any
successful attempt to deny the name of poetry to such magnificent things
as the close of <i>The Dunciad</i> and the close of <i>The Vanity of Human Wishes</i>.
I have never seen any real fight at all made for this denial except the endeavour
to turn them, as scapegoats, into the wilderness of rhetoric. And
that, as I have said already, is really a begging of the question. Most certainly
there is rhetoric which is not poetry&mdash;there is a very great deal of it&mdash;in
fact most of it; as certainly there is rhetoric which is. And the passages
which may claim that name in the eighteenth century, if never quite so
great as the two just mentioned, are very numerous. There is that fine one
in Tickell's epitaph on Cadogan which, after the eclipse of eighteenth-century
verse in the earlier nineteenth, Thackeray was the first to rediscover:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ah, no! when once the mortal yields to fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blast of Fame's sweet trumpet sounds too late&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too late to stay the spirit on its flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or soothe the new inhabitant of light,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">with its later address to Fame herself:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou music, warbling to the deafened ear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou incense, wasted on the funeral bier!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">There is Akenside's still finer <i>Epistle to Curio</i>, which Macaulay laughed at
rather ignobly as unpractical. Well, Akenside, like Macaulay himself, was a
Whig, and I am a Tory; nor are the ideals expressed in the following lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
by any means mine. But if they are not fine lines, if they are not, though in
one of the outer provinces no doubt, poetical, I will acknowledge that I know
nothing at all about poetry:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ye shades immortal, who by Freedom led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in the field or on the scaffold bled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bend from your radiant seats a joyful eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And view the crown of all your labours nigh.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See Freedom mounting her eternal throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword submitted, and the laws her own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See public power chastised beneath her stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes intent and uncorrupted hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See private life by wisest arts reclaimed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See ardent youth to noblest manners framed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See us acquire whate'er was sought by you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Curio! only Curio! will be true.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Well, once more, Curio, <i>alias</i> Pulteney, was <i>not</i> true, but deserted Akenside's
party and became Earl of Bath and possessor of no small part thereof. And
private life and ardent youth were not reclaimed much in the days of the
historic Charteris and the fictitious Lovelace. And the practical realisation
of something like Akenside's undoubted principles and aspirations was the
French Revolution fifty and the Russian Revolution nearer two hundred
years later. But all this has nothing to do with the question whether in
this passage also rhetoric, which hardly anybody will deny to it, has not
passed under the influence and received the transforming force of poetry.
I say it has, though I am perfectly willing to admit that it is not the best
or the most poetical form of poetry, and that it is very far indeed from the
forms that I myself like best. But one of the cries which the critic should
never be tired of uttering, whether in the streets or in the wilderness, is
that nothing is bad merely because it is different from another thing which
is good, and that in this world there is no equality or fixed standard to which
everything must be cut down or stretched out. The best rhetorical poetry
of the eighteenth century is not the best poetry, but it is poetry in its own
way, exhibiting the glow, the rush, the passion, which strict prose cannot,
and which poetry can, give.</p>

<p>There is less specific prejudice against "light" poetry on the part of
poetical highfliers than there is against poetical rhetoric, but there is some.
Once more I venture to disallow this prejudice <i>in toto</i> as far as kind is
concerned, though, of course, each individual specimen of that kind must
pass its individual muster as a piece of intenser thought or feeling, expressed
in appropriate language and inspired by the charm of verse-music. For
that, though no one ever has defined or will define poetry, is one of the
divers good approaches to a description of it. Now here, as was briefly said
above, the eighteenth century possessed, for nearly the whole of its first
quarter as an actual living practitioner, and for the whole of the rest of it
as a past contemporary of still living persons, an unsurpassed general of
light verse in Matthew Prior. On the whole I know few English poets who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
have so seldom had full justice done to them. No competent judge, indeed,
has ever denied Prior's excellence in pure lightness, but there have been
frequent failures to allow for that undercurrent of seriousness, sadness, and
almost passion&mdash;that "feeling in earnest while thinking in jest," according
to the best definition of humour&mdash;which characterises him. Thackeray has,
indeed, equalled, but in obvious and even frank following, the great lines
written (or not written) in Mézeray's <i>History of France</i>; but hardly anyone
else has come near them in irony and melancholy and music, blended as
three appeals in one. There is even a touch, though more than a touch
would have been out of place, in the famous <i>Child of Quality</i>, and a great
deal more, not quite so perfectly expressed, in the <i>Lines to Charles Montague</i>.
If the touch of sadness be for the moment unwelcome, there is <i>Daphne and
Apollo</i> or the famous <i>English Padlock</i>, with a dozen or several dozen others
ready to hand. And to go to yet another <i>nuance</i>, the recent discovery at
Longleat of <i>Jinny the Just</i>, with its touches of sincere sorrow and the three
unequalled stanzas of kindly irony:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus still, while her morning unseen fled away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ord'ring the linen and making the tea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she scarce could have time for the psalms of the day&mdash;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And while after dinner the night came so soon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That half she proposed very seldom was done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With twenty "God bless me's, how this day has gone!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">While she read, and accounted, and paid, and abated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ate and drank, played and worked, laughed and cried, loved and hated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>As answered the end of her being created</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">especially with that last unsurpassable line; all these and many more
exemplify and illustrate that indescribable raising of the expression&mdash;that
making the common as if it were not common&mdash;which is the essence of
poetry and the privilege of verse.</p>

<p>How this side of the matter was produced (in the mathematical sense)
and maintained throughout the century would take many times the space
of the present paper to show in anything but the briefest and barest epitome.
Almost all Prior's own shorter later poems would have to be quoted; Swift,
though so much greater in prose, and though best in verse on the severer
side, especially in the magnificent and quite sufficiently authenticated
<i>Judgment Day</i> verses, could not be left out; and it might be possible to make
more fight than even lovers of the eighteenth century have recently made
for Gray. But perhaps the scraps and orts of lesser men of letters&mdash;though
sometimes not lesser <i>men</i>&mdash;show the strong point of the century even more
convincingly. Where will you find more musical lightness of a certain easy
but far from unpoetical kind than in those verses on Strawberry Hill in
which Pulteney almost paid his rather heavy debts in more serious ways
to the House of Walpole? Or than in the others in which he and Chesterfield
combined to estimate "Hanover Bremen and Verden," that is to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
the whole continental dominions for which George the Second was making
England fight, as worthless compared with the charms of Molly Lepell?
Go lower still, take a professional littérateur and laureate like William
Whitehead, to whom hardly anybody save Mr. Austin Dobson (and it is
certainly no small exception) has been favourable, and read the piece on
Celia, which is a more or less independent expansion of Ausonius on Crispa.
It begins with a sort of pettish avowal of ignorance how the mischief of
love came, and goes on with rather rude depreciations of the lady's face,
figure, air, and even sense. Then it slides rapidly into a sort of grudging
allowance:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her voice, her touch, <i>might</i> give the alarm&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas both perhaps or neither,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">and then capitulates headlong:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In short 'twas that provoking charm<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Celia altogether!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Trivial, of course, but then it ought to be trivial, and the trivial can be, and
is, here super-trivialised.</p>

<p>One might go on, even in this skipping fashion, for a long time till one came
to the great political satires of the close of the century, but once more time
and space forbid. As it has been frivolously said:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You have only to search<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Dodsley and Pearch<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">(the standard ten volumes of eighteenth-century miscellaneous poetry) and
you will find; though, of course, if you only look for bad things you will
find them, too, in plenty. But even this collection is by no means exhaustive,
and with some of the more famous verse-writers it does not deal at all;
while we have in this survey confessedly left most of them alone. What
has been intended is to show that making of the common uncommon by
means of treatment in verse was not an unknown thing between 1700 and
1800; that it was attempted and achieved in various kinds. Finally, if the
attempts were rarely and the achievements hardly ever in kinds that can be
called the very highest, one may at least urge that there is not an absolute
vacuum between the loftiest mountain-tops of poetry and the actual plain
of prose&mdash;that Parnassus has lower slopes, some of which are not so <i>very</i> low</p>

<p class="p0 center b1">By EDWARD SHANKS</p>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">SAMUEL</span> Butler was a philosopher whose favourite doctrine was
expressed in the words <i>pas trop de zèle</i>; and he spent a great part
of his life complaining a little too eagerly that the world was not
sufficiently zealous in the appreciation of his works. His reception
and his reputation did indeed deserve a considerable part of the almost
excessive attention which he lavished on them; for at this moment, now that
the first is accomplished and the second enormous, they make a very curious
subject for study. In his notebooks they occur again and again as themes for his
meditation. "I am the <i>enfant terrible</i>," he says, "of literature and science.
If I cannot, and I know I cannot, get the literary and scientific big-wigs to
give me a shilling, I can, and I know I can, heave bricks into the middle of
them." "I have chosen the fighting-road," he says elsewhere, "rather
than the hang-on-to-a-great-man road, and what can a man who does this
look for except that people should try to silence him in whatever way they
think will be most effectual? In my case they have thought it best to pretend
that I am non-existent." There is something pathetic in the spectacle of a man
pursuing "the fighting-road" with no one to fight him and heaving bricks
into the middle of persons who obstinately continue to ignore his existence.
There is something more pathetic in the spectacle of an original thinker
and a great wit sitting down in isolation to pen these apologies for his obscure
position, always affecting to be indifferent to it and never deceiving anyone.
For Butler was not indifferent to his lack of success. Had his been a true and
not an assumed indifference he could not have returned to the subject so
often as he does and in so many keys. He betrays himself again and again
beyond mistake. He was an intensely, a morbidly sensitive man, one to
whom success would have been very pleasant. He was damaged, and
confirmed in oddity, by the want of it. He missed it because of what first
started him in oddity&mdash;that is to say, an unfortunate childhood.</p>

<p>"The subject of this memoir," so Butler once suggested that his
biography ought to begin, "was the son of rich but dishonest parents."
Dishonest they may have been: respectable they certainly were. Dr.
Butler, the first distinguished member of the family, was for twenty-seven
years headmaster of Shrewsbury, a man with all the attributes of the great
schoolmasters of the early nineteenth century, an imposing figure, who,
towards the end of his life, became Bishop of Lichfield. His son was not so
distinguished. His sole claim to be remembered, if his canonry be disregarded,
is the fact that somehow or other he became the father of Samuel Butler.
There is much detail, in Mr. Festing Jones's enormous book, on Butler's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
early life and his relation to his parents; but there is nothing quite so
significant as an anecdote which occurs in the second volume:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At Saas he made the acquaintance of Mr. and Mrs. MacCarthy, who were staying
in the hotel with their son, an Eton boy. One day the father and son had been for an
excursion and the father returned alone. The anxious mother, hearing that her boy
preferred speculating in short cuts to accompanying his father, borrowed a red
umbrella to make herself conspicuous, and went out "to look for Desmond."
Presently she came upon Butler loaded up with his camera and toiling along on his
way back after a fatiguing day. He told her he had seen a little white figure among
the trees on the mountain-side and had no doubt it was her son who, he assured her,
would be all right, and he himself was loitering, intending to be overtaken so that
they might arrive at the hotel together.</p>

<p>"You see," he explained, "I know he will be late for dinner, and it may make
things a little easier for him if he does not come in alone."</p>

<p>Years afterwards Mrs. MacCarthy told me that she had been reading <i>The Way of
All Flesh</i>, and had remembered this incident and had for the first time understood
why Butler thought that her son would require the presence of an elderly gentleman
to protect him from his parents if he came in late for dinner.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This throws a curious and unexpected sidelight on Butler's childhood
from the effects of which he never recovered. His parents learnt the art
of bringing up children from a book which adjured them to "Break your
child's will early or he will break yours later on." They did not break it,
but unquestionably they deformed it. This may have been done on principle.
To Butler, however, it sometimes seemed to spring from other
motives. "I have felt," he once said of his father, "that he has always
looked upon me as something which he could badger with impunity." He
said that, like Ernest Pontifex, with regard to his father he could remember
no feeling during his childhood except fear and shrinking.</p>

<p>Nor was this life of terror and pain lightened by any gracious or liberal
influences. The world which Mr. Festing Jones exhibits to us in his opening
chapters is full of the drabbest and most depressing horrors of Early
Victorianism. Its measure can be taken by a single story which Butler
preserved:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Archdeacon Bather was lunching with my grandfather some two or three years
after the Archdeacon had lost his first wife. Dr. Butler dearly loved a hard crust
of bread baked nearly black, and it so happened that a piece was set by his plate with
hardly any crust, and what little there was, very thin. My aunt, then Miss Butler,
observing what had happened, at once said:</p>

<p>"Oh, Papa, this won't do at all! I will find you a piece more to your liking."
Whereon she went to the kitchen and returned with a crust baked exactly to
Dr. Butler's taste.</p>

<p>When Archdeacon Bather saw this he said to himself: "That is the young woman
for me"; and shortly afterwards he proposed and was accepted.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Readers will remember the scene in <i>The Way of All Flesh</i> in which
Theobald, driving away for his honeymoon, insists that Christina shall order
their dinner at the first stop, and in which Christina protests with tears her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
nervousness, and Theobald replies, "It is a wife's duty to order her
husband's dinner; you are my wife, and I shall expect you to order mine."
A sensitive child, neglected or even ill-treated by its parents, might, if the
relations of the parents between themselves had anything beautiful or
kindly, see some possibilities of happiness in the institution of the family.
But Samuel Butler was brought up in a world where no such possibilities
seemed to exist. He came to believe, Mr. Festing Jones tells us, that, like
Habakkuk, <i>le père de famille est capable de tout</i>. It has often been maintained
that the greatest poets and artists do nothing throughout life but draw on
those fresh and lovely impressions which they have gathered in childhood.
When he was a child Butler acquired habits of suspicion against all those
surrounding him who were not connected with him by freely-chosen bonds
of friendship. Canon Butler bullied him on moral grounds; and he grew to
suspect every claim made on him, every exhortation addressed to him, on
moral grounds. Ernest Pontifex is described on one occasion as assuming
the expression of a puppy which is being scolded for something it does not
understand; and Butler did indeed develop some of the habits of an ill-treated
dog. He shied and snarled at a lifted hand, which might have been
lifted in kindness or in ignorance of his existence. Having, as he supposed,
penetrated the fraud of the family, he felt a distrust of all human institutions.
He suspected the world of being in a conspiracy to pretend that parents were
naturally kind to their children, that Christ rose from the dead, and that
Tennyson was a great poet. And, turning from all these discredited shows,
he devoted himself in isolation to the care of his own idiosyncrasies and the
companionship of a very few, very intimate friends.</p>

<p>Here, where he might in one case have suspected with justice, he was all
blind trust. The story of Charles Paine Pauli is one of the most extraordinary
that have been brought to light in human records in recent years. A
correspondent who knew him and admired him wrote not long ago to the
<i>Times</i>, not to controvert Mr. Festing Jones's account of the relations between
him and Butler, but to protest, in an almost agonised manner, that there
must be some explanation of it; and this is precisely what the reader, who
did not know Pauli, feels when he comes upon these pages. But there seems
to be no explanation.</p>

<p>In 1859 Butler rebelled against his father, and finally decided that he
could not take Orders, basing his refusal on "doubts," which in after years
seemed to him no less absurd than the doctrines against which they were
directed. As a result of this, he emigrated to New Zealand, taking with him
an allowance from Canon Butler and a promise of support in capital, in order
that he might establish himself as a sheep-farmer. In this occupation he was,
against all the probabilities, moderately successful and, largely owing to the
rapidly-developing condition of the colony, managed to turn an original
capital of £4400 into the sum of £8000. But finding the life uncongenial,
he concluded that it would be wiser to invest his money in New Zealand,
where the current rate of interest was 10 per cent., and go home and live on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
the proceeds. While he was making preparations to this end, a previous
slight acquaintance with Pauli developed into an intimate friendship. Pauli
was handsome, fascinating, well dressed, ineffably well mannered. He was,
in fact, the Towneley of <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>, though Providence, not doing
as well by him as by Towneley, had omitted to make him rich. He was
actually poor and in ill-health, and anxious to go to England in order that
he might recover. He then proposed to get called to the Bar and to return
to New Zealand to practise. Butler, who believed himself to be worth about
£800 a year, promptly lavished on this creature the generosity and tenderness
which had found no outlet during his childhood. He offered to lend
him £100 for his passage, and to allow him £200 a year for three years&mdash;that
is, until his return to New Zealand as a barrister. They accordingly made
the passage together; and Butler kept his promise, and more than kept it,
extending the allowance, even through the time of his acutest financial
difficulties, until Pauli's death in 1897. It was then discovered that at one
time Pauli had been earning £900 a year, and that even at the last he earned
between £500 and £700. He left a fortune of £9000; but Butler was not mentioned
in the will and received his invitation to the funeral from the undertaker.</p>

<p>A singular and enlightening circumstance in the intercourse between
Butler and Pauli unhappily prevents Mr. Festing Jones from making this
astonishing but veracious narrative entirely lifelike. The charming young
man did not reciprocate the feelings of his pathetic and somewhat uncouth
adorer. "I had felt from the very beginning," says Butler, "that my
intimacy with Pauli was only superficial, and I also perceived more and
more that I bored him." Pauli confessed that he had never been more
miserable in his life than once when he spent a holiday with Butler at Dieppe.
Consequently it soon came about that the essential part of the relations
between them was the punctual payment of the allowance. Latterly, they
only met three times a week, when Pauli lunched in Butler's chambers. He
discontinued informing Butler of his changes of address, so that at the end
Butler did not know where he was living, and Mr. Festing Jones met him
"only on business, for he would have nothing to do with any of Butler's
friends in any other way." Butler learnt of his death from an announcement
in the <i>Times</i>.</p>

<p>Truly a mysterious creature! And his friend is very comprehensible in
supposing that there must be some explanation. Possibly Mr. Festing Jones,
if he had met him otherwise than purely on business, might have given us
some impression of his personality which would have let in light on this
dark business. As it is, we must content ourselves with wonder at the
extraordinary situations which human nature is capable of creating. But
this unhappy friendship is worth examining, apart from its intrinsic curiosity,
because it presents in extremity an essential and determining part of Butler's
life. His devotion and loyalty to his friends were perhaps the most beautiful
things in his character and do much to redeem his somewhat unlovely
attitude of snarling and suspicion towards all strangers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
Life might be thought to have treated him savagely in following up his
parents with the hardly less cruel Pauli. He disguised the shock of his
discovery on Pauli's death by remarking that he would now save not only
£200 a year, but also the cost of those three lunches a week in Clifford's Inn.
Yet a nature that opened itself so trustingly, so defencelessly, must have
suffered on finding its bounty abused. But in his other friends, in Miss
Savage, in his clerk, Alfred Emery Cathie, and in Mr. Festing Jones he had
ample compensations. He was a man who at first sight was not readily liked.
He was awkward and nervous in the company of strangers, and it is likely
that he did not disguise so well as he supposed his grave misgivings that
they were either pretentious scoundrels or conceited hypocrites. He was
always badly and carelessly dressed; and though his portraits, when one is
used to them and can associate them with the best one knows of his mind,
become attractive, there can be no denial that his appearance was on the
most lenient showing decidedly grotesque, that of a difficult, taciturn,
maliciously observant gnome, roughly carved in a hard wood. It took some
time and some degree of intuition to penetrate behind this mask. Those who
did so were rewarded and rewarded him. Miss Savage, who used to meet
him first at Heatherley's art-classes, was not attracted by him for a considerable
time. When at last she was, it was by a flash of remarkable intuition.
In commenting on one of his books, she writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I like the cherry-eating scene, too, because it reminded me of your eating cherries
when first I knew you. One day when I was going to the gallery, a very hot day, I
remember, I met you on the shady side of Berners Street eating cherries out of a
basket. Like your Italian friends, you were perfectly silent with content, and you
handed the basket to me as I was passing, without saying a word. I pulled out a
handful and went on my way rejoicing, without saying a word either. I had not
before perceived you to be different from anyone else.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It is not certain whether Miss Savage became a Butlerian or whether Butler
acquired something of what we consider his characteristic attitude of mind
from her. If it was not so, then her spirit leapt at once to answer his as soon
as she had perceived the possibility of common interests between them, for
her first letters to him are written in his own vein. She entered immediately
into his concerns, read all his books in manuscript, criticised them, gave them
more praise than they received from anyone else, and abused his enemies
with a gusto equal to his. The only trouble between them in their long
connection was his gnawing fear that she wanted to marry him. And he did
not want to marry anyone, let alone her who was</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Plain and lame and fat and short,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forty and overkind.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">But if all these disabilities had been removed, he would still have been
disinclined to marry her. He did not believe in marriage, had a hatred of
the family; and he slunk away snarling from the danger like a terror-stricken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
wild animal at the sight of a trap, only to reproach himself in after years for
unkindness to his friend. But his relations with women were not, and he did
not intend that they should be, of the sort that lead to marriage. He had
mistresses, whom he visited. Mr. J. B. Yeats, in a recent paper of
reminiscences, has repeated his avowals on this point in a manner which
conveys well enough Butler's view that his lapses were caused by a necessity
of the flesh. Mr. Festing Jones reinforces this impression. One of his
mistresses, referred to as "Madame," was, after a long connection, allowed
to visit his chambers in Clifford's Inn. No other gained this privilege; and
Butler extended it to her as he might have done to an old and well-tried
servant. Butler did not love these women, he frequented them. He was
insensible to the notion that there might be anything beautiful in the
relations between the sexes, as he was insensible to the notion that there
might be anything of value written in verse. Theobald and Christina
pretended to like poetry: Theobald and Christina pretended to love one
another and him. It was all of a piece with their pretence that Christianity
was a religion of kindliness and enlightenment.</p>

<p>So he remained a bachelor, and, when Miss Savage was dead, contented
himself with the intimate companionship of Mr. Jones and Alfred, his clerk.
After he had resigned the ambition of becoming a painter, after his odd and
disastrous excursion in the world of business, his daily life was that of an
eccentric gentleman with a small independent income. He read and wrote
in the British Museum, he went for walks in the country and took holidays
in Italy, he published his books at his own expense, and he scrambled out
of invitations to dinner as best he could. For a hobby he wrote music in
collaboration with Mr. Festing Jones, oratorios which were to be as much
like Handel's oratorios as possible. The first of them, <i>Narcissus</i>, was inspired
by his own misfortunes in business, and the final chorus ran:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How blest the prudent man, the maiden pure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose income is both ample and secure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arising from consolidated Three<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Per Cent. Annuities, paid quarterly!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">"We remembered Handel's treatment of 'continually,'" says Mr. Festing
Jones, "and thought we could not do better than imitate it for our words
'paid quarterly.'"</p>

<p>And so his life went on and his interests drifted through the theory of
evolution, the authorship of the <i>Odyssey</i>, the life of his grandfather, and the
meaning of Shakespeare's Sonnets. The sales of his books pursued a course
by no means so varied, but steadily declined. In 1899, when he drew up a
statement of profit and loss, the average sales of his eleven books, excluding
<i>Erewhon</i>, which was the first, amounted to 306 copies each. Of his <i>Selections
from Previous Works</i>, 120 copies were sold in fifteen years. Of <i>The Authoress
of the Odyssey</i>, 165 copies were sold. He might well have added discouragement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
to his first cause of bitterness. The religion of Christ produced Canon
Butler, the religion of science produced Darwin, the religion of good looks
and good breeding produced Pauli. On paper he was indomitable. He swore
he had enjoyed life, that on the balance his good luck overbalanced the bad.
But he swore a little too often, he explained a little too much in detail for
this to have been quite true. And then, at the very end of his life, the luck
turned, and his last book, by a strange irony, was produced at the publisher's
own risk, the greatest triumph in his literary career which Butler was able to
see since the success of his first book. After he was dead his reputation,
magically assisted with incantations by Mr. Bernard Shaw and others,
sprang up to an amazing height, like the plant grown from the Indian
enchanter's bean.</p>

<p>Now the world is confronted with a situation in which the neglected
philosopher of Clifford's Inn has attained an importance he never dreamt of
and perhaps would not have approved. "Above all things," he said, "let
no unwary reader do me the injustice of believing in <i>me</i>." This useful motto
was printed on the menu of the first Erewhon dinner; but a great
number of his disciples have disregarded the admonition. I was once the
witness of one undergraduate trying to proselytise another and telling him
that it was a worthy ambition to desire to be like Christ. "I don't want to
be like anyone else," replied the second undergraduate, "but if I did, I
shouldn't choose Christ, I should choose Samuel Butler." This is at once
an extreme instance and one strictly guarded against Butler's own
disapproval: for the kernel of the remark would meet with his applause.
But it illustrates the direction in which many of his admirers have more
frenetically rushed. It is an ironic fate for so ironic a philosopher that his
teaching should have become a sort of Tom Tiddler's ground for so many
solemn and ridiculous persons.</p>

<p>What, after all, is his total achievement? He himself summed up what
he considered to be his life-work in a statement which is not dated but which
must have been written in 1899 or later. It begins with (1) The emphasising
the analogies between crime and disease [<i>Erewhon</i>], and ends with (17)
The elucidation of Shakespeare's <i>Sonnets</i> [<i>Shakespeare's Sonnets Reconsidered</i>.]
"The foregoing," he continues, "is the list of my mares'-nests,
and it is, I presume, this list which made Mr. Arthur Platt call me the
Galileo of Mares'-nests in his diatribe on my <i>Odyssey</i> theory in the <i>Classical
Review</i>." The two to which he probably attached most importance, to judge
from the bitterness of his remarks on their reception, were his intervention
into the great evolution dispute and his great discovery that the <i>Odyssey</i> was
written by a female inhabitant of Trapani in Sicily. With regard to the second
he continually complained that no classical scholar had ever replied to his
arguments. It was once remarked in answer to this, that if a classical scholar
published a book arguing that no player of Rugby football ought to be
allowed to pass the ball to another without obtaining a signed receipt for it,
the great community of Rugby footballers, intent on other matters, would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
probably ignore his suggestion. Butler's claim may perhaps be left there.
Yet he did apparently take it seriously, in spite of his failure to deal with the
singular fact that no scrap of confirmation of his theory has survived from
the writings or the traditions of antiquity. His "mares'-nests," he said,
"were simply sovereigns which he found lying in public places and which
people would not notice and be at the trouble of picking up." They were
mostly, however, one cannot help suspecting, recommended to him less
because they seemed to be sovereigns than because other people would not
pick them up. They were, in fact, the notions of a crank, who, having
acquired a distrust of the rest of the world, took pains to differ from it as
much as he could.</p>

<p>His theories of evolution hold a different position. Darwin's theory has
now been so greatly modified, as much by his supporters as by his opponents,
that it cannot be said any longer to hold the field as he first presented it;
and Butler's attitude has been in a manner justified. But this change has been
accomplished not by the acceptance of Butler's views but by the work of
experimental biologists. He did, in fact, offer many general principles, some
well founded, some mistaken, all stimulating, for the consideration of
practical workers; and it would not be possible to assert, without an
exhaustive enquiry into the history of the matter, that his writings have had
no influence on the development of science. But Charles Darwin and his
followers were practical men&mdash;men no doubt with faults, with the intolerance
and impatience of the laity that are often to be found in the scientific
investigator. It is not hard to see why they received Butler with tepid
interest, and finally ignored him when he forsook their path of enquiry.
For they did ignore him: they did not, as he supposed, conspire to silence
him. He seems to have believed that Darwin was a sort of Anti-Christ
malevolently determined to force on humanity a diabolical belief of his own
invention; and he was only too ready to suspect him of unscrupulous dealing
and machinations. When he conceived that Darwin had engineered an
attack on him, though he obtained an expression of regret for an accident, he
flung violently into print, and did, though he remained ignorant of the fact,
get from Darwin and his friends the attention as an enemy which they
would not bestow on him as a scientist. His letter to the <i>Athenæum</i> seriously
perturbed Darwin, who drafted two replies to it, and submitted them for
advice to the members of his family and to Professor Huxley. The advice
given was against replying; and Butler was accordingly confirmed in his
opinion. But this was an opinion which a less suspicious man would have
been slower in forming and readier to discard.</p>

<p>Darwin was not, in his career or in his handling of Butler, a model of the
urbane virtues. Butler did right to protest against the sacerdotal attitude
which Victorian men of science frequently adopted. But he did wrong not to
realise that Darwin did not take him altogether seriously, and why this was
so. Butler's challenging manner of writing, the prickly defensiveness which
he developed on the smallest provocation, must have been disagreeable to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
the great investigator who had spent years of careful research into the
problems which Butler airily settled at his writing-table in the intervals of
other pursuits. Darwin is perhaps to blame, but not so greatly to blame as
Butler contended, if he regarded Butler at first as a well-disposed, and then
as an ill-disposed, amateur; and that was in effect his view of the whole
matter. When he sent <i>Evolution Old and New</i> to Dr. Krause, he expressed
the hope that the German writer "would not expend much powder and
shot on Mr. Butler, for he really is not worthy of it. His book is merely
ephemeral." And it was in fact ephemeral or nearly so. Butler's works on
evolution contain many inspired guesses; but the inherent value of these
ceases to have much more than a historical interest when they are confirmed
by practical observation. If they are not so confirmed they remain open to
question, though they may have their uses in suggesting paths for research.
Butler's place in science is somewhat below that of Goethe, who did after
all make a practical discovery which remains valid to-day.</p>

<p>Some of his "mares'-nests," then, were "mares'-nests" from the
beginning. Others, neglected when they might have been useful, had begun
to be superannuated when they first attracted attention. But Butler, apart
from his theories and his discoveries, remains as an observer of life and a
teacher of conduct. Passages of this nature exist in all his works; but,
generally speaking, his claim to be accepted as a philosopher rests on five
books, <i>Erewhon</i>, <i>Erewhon Revisited</i>, the <i>Note-books</i>, <i>The Way of All Flesh</i>,
and Mr. Festing Jones's biography.</p>

<p>Mr. Festing Jones observes that "I was struck by his uncompromising
sincerity. If a subject interested him, he took infinite pains to find out all he
could about it first-hand, thought it over and formed an opinion of his own,
without reference to what anyone else thought or said." In demonstration of
this, Mr. Jones relates the following reminiscence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We talked about Charlotte Brontë; Butler did not like her; I said, as though
taking the odd trick with the ace of trumps:</p>

<p>"Well, at all events, she wrote three splendid novels."</p>

<p>He replied in a low voice, reluctantly but decidedly: "They are not splendid."</p>

<p>These four words shifted the subject under discussion from the splendour or
otherwise of Charlotte Brontë's novels to the sincerity or otherwise of my opinion.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It was no doubt well that Mr. Jones's sincerity should be probed; and this
is in fact what Butler does at his best. He challenges established opinions
and forces those who hold them to consider whether they have any good
ground for doing so. But the reader who is not dazzled by Butler's originality
of judgment in this instance will ask himself whether the sentence which
Mr. Jones quotes is anything more than a very facile assertion. He will then
perhaps ask himself how often Butler's original pronouncements on
established reputations are of the same order. He will certainly find some.
In the <i>Note-books</i> there is an elaborate arraignment of Raphael. It may
not be convincing; but the critic has produced his arguments. Here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
also, may be found Butler's explanation of his hostility towards post-Handelian
music. But one may search the two volumes of the biography for
a considerable time without finding his appreciation of any book published
in his own time. Here, again, we must be just: Butler did like one book.
It was called <i>Pusley, or My Summer in a Garden</i>; its author was Charles
Dudley Warner; and Butler said, "I like <i>Pusley</i> very much and have read
it all."</p>

<p>But the majority of his opinions are on the model of the much-quoted
passage in the <i>Note-books</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Talking it over, we agreed that Blake was no good because he learnt Italian at sixty
in order to study Dante, and we knew Dante was no good because he was so fond of
Virgil, and Virgil was no good because Tennyson ran him, and as for Tennyson&mdash;well,
Tennyson goes without saying.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">That is an exceedingly witty way of expressing an indolent prejudice; and
those who share that particular chain of prejudices may well rejoice in it,
without supposing that it proves their case. But this particular form of
humour and Butler's independence of attitude would be slightly more
entertaining if he had occasionally replaced the reputations he smashed with
these hammer-strokes by some discovery of his own. Unfortunately, it is
not easy to remember any unknown author whom he brought into the light&mdash;unless
Nausicaa be taken as an example.</p>

<p>But this is, in a way, the defect of his qualities. It is easy, too easy, to grow
incensed with him when he inanely doubts any convention or opinion that
comes in sight. It is possible to remark of him, adapting the remark made of
Dr. Johnson, that he may have been very sensible at bottom, but that there
was a great deal of nonsense on top. But the fact remains that by challenging
everything he did detect a great many frauds, and he did let the light of
scepticism into a great many topics where scepticism is a healthy attitude.
If his view of family life was bigoted and unreasonable, there is a great deal
of use in the reminder that family life is not necessarily perfect and needs a
deal of watching to keep it from being very imperfect indeed. Some of the
assumptions he challenged have now disappeared. We no longer believe that
good looks and good manners are the unmistakable indices of an ill heart;
and we are becoming convinced that it is better to have these attributes than
to be without them. But these lessons can be enforced as Butler continually
enforces them. It was his fate that life made him a suspicious man. But
suspicion made him a doubting, questioning, and therefore enquiring man.
And his natural gift of humour taught him what he has ever since been
teaching others, that it is possible to be serious without being solemn. This
was perhaps the most valuable thing he had to say to a society emerging from
the Victorian era and passing over into another that was to be as desperately
serious as we are now realising. It is a reflection pathetically ironical that his
loudest followers in these days should be persons whom he would very likely
have described as Simeonites of the intellect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
Of the value of his writings judged as literature it is not so easy to speak
with confidence. <i>Erewhon</i> is not so much a novel as a collection of essays
roughly pressed into a common mould. They are not merely disconnected,
they are also composed on different planes of satire, at different removes from
reality, so that the reader as he goes from chapter to chapter has an uncomfortable
sense of being jolted from level to level. Yet the satire, on its varying
levels, is extraordinarily easy, ingenious, and penetrating; and, in another
key again, the opening chapters make one of the best introductions to a story
of exploration ever written. <i>Erewhon Revisited</i> is the book of an old man;
and it has much of the beauty so often to be found in such compositions.
The manner of its writing was very different from that of its predecessor,
and it is impossible to complain of any unevenness in its structure. Nevertheless
the satire is not so easy. It is a little strained, a little too ingenious,
a little too closely calculated to make good reading. Butler himself picked
out the best part of the book when he complained that none of his critics
had noticed the idea of a father attempting by noble conduct to deserve the
good opinion of a newly-found and adored son. Thus, at the end of his life,
still haunted by early memories, he attempted to fashion in imagination
what should have been and completely to invert the facts of his own
childhood.</p>

<p><i>The Way of All Flesh</i> is precisely the opposite of this. It has long been
known to be of the photographic order of novels; but how minutely
photographic it is we could not know until the appearance of Mr. Jones's
book. This need not, and should not, affect our judgment of it, even when we
are informed that Theobald's delightful letters are almost literal transcriptions
from those of Canon Butler. We can very well continue to admire
the inimitable accuracy and vividness with which these real scenes are
described, while we suffer from the painful bitterness of this exhaustive
improvisation on the old theme of parents and children. But the whole book
is not of equal merit. It begins to weaken at the point where Ernest's career
diverges from Butler's own experience; and when it reaches the catastrophe
it sinks into improbabilities from which it never recovers. The Ernest, whose
thoughts and feelings at Cambridge have been described, and who was
Butler, would never have made that disastrous mistake over Miss Maitland's
real profession. Butler did not in fact ever make it, nor did he
ever develop into the super-prig which Ernest became after his release
from prison.</p>

<p>Butler's reputation will probably rest more and more, as time goes on,
on his <i>Note-books</i> and on Mr. Jones's biography, which might be described
together as the story of a distrustful man. Indeed, posterity reading these
alone, will probably miss little of what it should retain: for Butler was careful
of his best things, and most of them are to be found here as well as in the
books in which he enshrined them among more perishable material. On the
strength of these two books he will remain a definite and unforgettable
character, though he may, probably will, recede in importance, perhaps even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
to the level of those wits whose "table-talk" is read by the curious in every
generation.</p>

<p>But even so, there he will be still: a man whom fate tortured into such
distrust of his fellows as to make him question everything and teach others
to do the same. He suffered intensely in the process that made him what he
was: he suffered again, much more than he would ever admit, from the
ineffaceable results of the process. "I do not deny, however," he bursts out,
"that I have been ill-used. I have been used abominably." This cry rings
truer, echoes longer in the memory, than the assertion which follows that
he considered the balance of good fortune to have been on his side. By one of
those contrivances of events with which fate marks the lives of distinguished
men, an atmosphere of distrust followed him on to his death-bed and beyond
it. For the doctors disagreed during his last illness, and Mr. Festing Jones
doubts the accuracy of the causes given in the certificate of death.</p>

<h2>THE CRYSTAL VASE</h2>

<p class="center">By MAURICE HEWLETT</p>

<p class="drop-cap1"><span class="smcap1">I HAVE</span> often wished that I could write a novel in which, as mostly
in life, thank goodness, nothing happened. Jane Austen, it has been
objected, forestalled me there, and it is true that she very nearly did&mdash;but
not quite. It was a point for her art to make that the novel
should have form. Form involved plot, plot a logic of events; events&mdash;well,
that means that there were collisions. They may have been mild
shocks, but persons did knock their heads together, and there were stars
to be seen by somebody. In life, in a majority of cases, there are no stars,
yet life does not on that account cease to be interesting; and even if stars
should happen to be struck out, it is not the collision, nor the stars either,
which interest us most. No, it is our state of soul, our mental process under
the stress which we care about; and as mental process is always going on,
and the state of the soul never the same for two moments together, there
is ample material for a novel of extreme interest, which need never finish,
which might indeed be as perennial as a daily newspaper or the Annual
Register. Why is it, do you suppose, that anybody, if he can, will read
anybody else's letter? It is because every man-Jack of us lives in a cage,
cut off from every other man-Jack; because we are incapable of knowing
what is going on in the mind of our nearest and dearest, and because we
burn for the assurance we may get by evidence of homogeneity procurable
from any human source. Man is a creature of social instinct condemned
by his nature to be solitary. Creatures in all outward respects similar to
himself are awhirl about him. They cannot help him, nor he them; he cannot
even be sure, for all he may assume it, that they share his hope and calling.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ensphered in flesh we live and die,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And see a myriad souls adrift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our likes, and send our voiceless cry<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shuddering across the void: "The truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Succour! The truth!" None can reply.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">That is the state of our case. We can cope with mere events, comedy, tragedy,
farce. The things that happen to us are not our life. They are imposed upon
life, they come and go. But life is a secret process. We only see the accretions.</p>

<p>The novel which I dreamed of writing has recently been done, or rather
begun, by Miss Dorothy Richardson. She betters the example of Jane
Austen by telling us much more about what seems to be infinitely less, but
is not so in reality. She dips into the well whereof Miss Austen skims the
surface. She has essayed to report the mental process of a young woman's
lifetime from moment to moment. In the course of four, if not five, volumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
nothing has happened yet but the death of a mother and the marriage of a
sister or so. She may write forty, and I shall be ready for the forty-first.
Mental process, the states of the soul, emotional reaction&mdash;these as they
are moved in us by other people are Miss Richardson's subject-matter,
and according as these are handled is the interest we can devote to her
novels. These flitting things are Miss Richardson's game, and they are the
things which interest us most in ourselves, and the things which we desire
to know most about in our neighbours.</p>

<p>But of course it won't do. Miss Richardson does not, and cannot, tell us
all. A novel is a piece of art which does not so much report life as transmute
it. She takes up what she needs for her purpose, and that may not be our
purpose. And so it is with poetry&mdash;we don't go to that for the facts, but
for the essence of fact. The poet who told us all about himself at some
particular pass would write a bad poem, for it is his affair to transfigure
rather than transmute, to move us by beauty at least as much as by truth.
What we look for so wistfully in each other is the raw material of poetry.
We can make the finished article for ourselves, given enough matter; and
indeed the poetry which is imagined in contemplation is apt to be much
finer than that which has passed through the claws of prosody and syntax.
The fact, to be short with it, is that literature has an eye upon the consumer.
Whether it is marketable or not, it is intended for the public. Now no
man will undress in public with design. It may be a pity, but so it is.
Undesignedly, I don't say. It would be possible, I think, by analysis, to
track the successive waves of mental process in <i>In Memoriam</i>. Again, <i>The
Angel in the House</i> brought Patmore as near to self-explication as a poet
can go. Shakespeare's Sonnets offer a more doubtful field of experiment.</p>

<p>What then? Shall we go to the letter-writers&mdash;to Madame de Sévigné, to
Gray, to Walpole and Cowper, Byron and Lamb? A letter-writer implies
a letter-reader, and just that inadequacy of spoken communication will
smother up our written words. Madame de Sévigné must placate her high-sniffing
daughter, Gray must please himself; Walpole must at any cost be
lively, Cowper must be urbane to Lady Hesketh or deprecate the judgment
of the Reverend Mr. Newton. Byron was always before the looking-glass
as he wrote; and as for Charles Lamb, do not suppose that he did anything
but hide in his clouds of ink. Sir Sidney Colvin thinks that Keats revealed
himself in his letters, but I cannot agree with him. Keats is one of the best
letter-writers we have; he can be merry, fanciful, witty, thoughtful, even
profound. He has a sardonic turn of language hardly to be equalled outside
Shakespeare. "Were it in my device, I would reject a Petrarchal coronation&mdash;on
account of my dying day, and because women have cancers." Where
will you match that but from Hamlet? But Keats knew himself. "It is a
wretched thing to confess, but it is a very fact, that not one word I can utter
can be taken for granted as an opinion growing out of my identical Nature."
So I find him in his letters, swayed rather by his fancies than his states of
soul, until indeed that soul of his was wrung by agony of mind and disease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
of body. Revelation, then, like gouts of blood, did issue, but of that I do
not now write. No man is sane at such a crisis.</p>

<p><i>Parva componere magnis</i>, there is a letter contained in <i>The Early Diary of
Frances Burney</i> (ed. Mrs. A. R. Ellis, 1889) more completely apocalyptic
than anything else of the kind accessible to me. Its writer was Maria Allen,
daughter of Dr. Burney's second wife, therefore half-sister to the charming
Burney girls. She was a young lady who could let herself go, in act as well
as on paper, and withal, as Fanny judged her, "flighty, ridiculous, uncommon,
lively, comical, entertaining, frank, and undisguised"&mdash;or because
of it&mdash;she did contrive to unfold her panting and abounding young self
more thoroughly than the many times more expert. You have her here in
the pangs of a love affair, of how long standing I don't know, but now
evidently in a bad state of miss-fire. It was to end in elopement, post-chaise,
clandestine marriage, in right eighteenth century. Here it is in an earlier
state, all mortification, pouting and hunching of the shoulder. I reproduce
it with Maria's punctuation, which shows it to have proceeded, as no doubt
she did herself, in gasps:</p>

<p>"I was at the Assembly, forced to go entirely against my own Inclination.
But I always have sacrificed my own inclinations to the will of other people&mdash;could
not resist the pressing Importunity of&mdash;Bet Dickens&mdash;to go&mdash;tho'
it proved Horribly stupid. I drank tea at the &mdash;&mdash; told old Turner&mdash;I
was determined not to dance&mdash;he would not believe me&mdash;a wager ensued&mdash;half-a-crown
provided I followed my own Inclinations&mdash;agreed&mdash;Mr.
Audley asked me. I refused&mdash;sat still&mdash;yet followed my own Inclinations.
But four couple began&mdash;Martin (c'etait Lui) was there&mdash;yet stupid&mdash;nimporte&mdash;quite
Indifferent&mdash;on both sides&mdash;Who had I&mdash;to converse with
the whole Evening&mdash;not a female friend&mdash;none there&mdash;not an acquaintance&mdash;All
Dancing&mdash;who then&mdash;I've forgot&mdash;nimporte&mdash;I broke my earring&mdash;how&mdash;heaven
knows&mdash;foolishly enough&mdash;one can't always keep on the Mask

almost the whole Night&mdash;two sets&mdash;yet I did not join them&mdash;Miss Jenny
Hawkins danced&mdash;with who&mdash;can't you guess&mdash;well&mdash;n'importe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There is more, but my pen is out of breath. Nobody but Mr. Jingle ever
wrote like that; and in so far as Maria Allen may be said to have had a
soul, there in its little spasms is the soul of Maria Allen, with all the
<i>malentendus</i> of the ballroom and all the surgings of a love affair at cross-purposes
thrown in.</p>

<p>As for Fanny Burney's early diary, its careful and admirable editor claims
that you have in it "the only published, perhaps the only existing record
of the life of an English girl, written of herself, in the eighteenth century."
I believe that to be true. It is a record, and a faithful and very charming
record of the externals of such a life. As such it is, to me at least, a valuable
thing. If it does not unfold the amiable, brisk, and happy Fanny herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
there are two simple reasons why it could not. First, she was writing her
journal for the entertainment of old Mr. Crisp of Chessington, the "Daddy
Crisp" of her best pages; secondly, it is not at all likely that she knew of
anything to unfold. Nor, for that matter, was Fanny herself of the kind that
can unfold to another person. Yet there is a charm all over the book, which
some may place here, some there, but which all will confess. For me it is
not so much that Fanny herself is a charming girl, and a girl of shrewd
observation, of a pointed pen, and an admirable gift of mimicry. She has
all that and more&mdash;she has a good heart. Her sister Susan is as good as she,
and there are many of Susan's letters. But the real charm of the book, I
think, is in the series of faithful pictures it contains of the everyday round
of an everyday family. Dutch pictures all&mdash;passers-by, a knock at the front
door, callers&mdash;Mr. Young, "in light blue embroidered with silver, a bag
and sword, and walking in the rain"; a jaunt to Greenwich, a concert at
home&mdash;the Agujari in one of her humours; a masquerade&mdash;"a very private
one, and at the house of Mr. Laluze ... Hetty had for three months
thought of nothing else ... she went as a Savoyard with a hurdy-gurdy
fastened round her waist. Nothing could look more simple, innocent,
and pretty. My dress was a close pink Persian vest covered with a gauze
in loose pleats...." What else? Oh, a visit to Teignmouth&mdash;Maria
Allen now Mrs. Ruston; another to Worcester; quiet days at King's Lynn,
where "I have just finished <i>Henry and Frances</i> ... the greatest part
of the last volume is wrote by Henry, and on the gravest of grave subjects,
and that which is most dreadful to our thoughts, Eternal Misery...."
Terrific novel: but need I go on? There may be some to whom a description
of the nothings of this our life will be as flat as the nothings themselves&mdash;but
I am not of that party. The things themselves interest me, and I confess
the charm. It is the charm of innocence and freshness, a morning dew upon
the words.</p>

<p>The Burneys, however, can do no more for us than shed that auroral
dew. They cannot reassure us of our normal humanity, since they needed
reassurance for themselves.</p>

<p>Where, then, shall we turn? So far as I am aware, to two only, except for
two others whom I leave out of account. Rousseau is one, for it is long since
I read him, but my recollection is that the <i>Confessions</i> is a kind of novel,
premeditated, selective, done with great art. Marie Bashkirtseff is another.
I have not read her at all. Of the two who remain I leave Pepys also out of
account, because, though it may be good for us to read Pepys, it is better
to have read him and be through with it. There, under the grace of God,
go a many besides Pepys, and among them every boy who has ever befouled
a wall with a stump of pencil. We are left then with one whom it is ill to
name in the same fill of the inkpot, "Wordsworth's exquisite sister," as
Keats, who saw her once, at once knew her to be.</p>

<p>In Dorothy Wordsworth's journals you may have the delight of daily
intercourse&mdash;<i>famigliarmente discorrendo</i>&mdash;with one of the purest and noblest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
souls ever housed in flesh; to that you may add the reassurance to be got from
word and implication beyond doubt. She tells us much, but implies more. We
may see deeply into ourselves, but she sees deeply into a deeper self than most
of us can discern. It is not only that, knowing her, we are grounded in the
rudiments of honour and lovely living; it is to learn that human life can so
be lived, and to conclude that of that at least is the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>

<p>These journals are for fragments only of the years which they cover, and
as such exist for Jan.-May, 1798 (Alfoxden), May-Dec., 1800, Oct.-Dec.,
1801, Jan.-July, 1802: all these at Grasmere. They have been printed by
Professor Knight, and I have the assurance of Mr. Gordon Wordsworth
that what little has been omitted is unimportant. Nothing is unimportant
to me, and I wish the whole had been given us; but what we have is enough
whereby to trace the development of her extraordinary mind and of her
power of self-expression. The latter, undoubtedly, grew out of emotion,
which gradually culminated until the day of William Wordsworth's marriage.
There it broke, and with it, as if by a determination of the will, there the
revelation ceased. A new life began with the coming of Mary Wordsworth
to Dove Cottage, a life of which Dorothy records the surface only.</p>

<p>The Alfoxden fragment (20 Jan.-22 May, 1798), written when she was
twenty-seven, is chiefly notable for its power of interpreting landscape.
That was a power which Wordsworth himself possessed in a high degree.
There can be no doubt, I think, that they egged each other on, but I myself
should find it hard to say which was egger-on and which the egged. This is
the first sentence of it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"20 Jan.&mdash;The green paths down the hillsides are channels for streams.
The young wheat is streaked by silver lines of water running between the
ridges, the sheep are gathered together on the slopes. After the wet dark
days the country seems more populous. It peoples itself in the sunbeams."</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is one of few days later:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"23rd.&mdash;Bright sunshine, went out at 3 o'cl. The sea perfectly calm
blue, streaked with deeper colour by the clouds, and tongues or points of
sand; on our return of a gloomy red. The sun gone down. The crescent
moon, Jupiter and Venus. The sound of the sea distinctly heard on the tops
of the hills, which we could never hear in summer. We attribute this partly
to the bareness of the trees, but chiefly to the absence of the singing birds,
the hum of insects, that noiseless noise which lives in the summer air.
The villages marked out by beautiful beds of smoke. The turf fading into
the mountain road."</p></blockquote>

<p>She handles words, phrases, like notes or chords of music, and never gets
her landscape by direct description. One more picture and I must leave it:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"26.&mdash; ... Walked to the top of a high hill to see a fortification.
Again sat down to feed upon the prospect; a magnificent scene, <i>curiously</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
spread out for even minute inspection, though so extensive that the mind
is afraid to calculate its bounds...."</p></blockquote>

<p>Coleridge was with them most days, or they with him. Here is a curious
point to note. Dorothy records:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"March 7th.&mdash;William and I drank tea at Coleridge's.... Observed
nothing particularly interesting.... One only leaf upon the top of a
tree&mdash;the sole remaining leaf&mdash;danced round and round like a rag blown
by the wind."</p></blockquote>

<p>And Coleridge has in <i>Christabel</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The one red leaf, the last of its clan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dances as often as dance it can,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hanging so light, and hanging so high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>William, Dorothy, and Coleridge went to Hamburg at the end of that
year, but in 1800 the brother and sister were in Grasmere; and the journal,
which opens with May 14, at once betrays the great passion of Dorothy's life:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"William and John set off into Yorkshire after dinner at half-past two
o'clock, cold pork in their pockets. I left them at the turning of the Low-Wood
bay under the trees. My heart was so full I could hardly speak to
W. when I gave him a farewell kiss. I sate a long time upon a stone at the
margin of the lake, and after a flood of tears my heart was easier. The
lake looked to me, I know not why, dull and melancholy, and the weltering
on the shore seemed a heavy sound.... I resolved to write a journal
of the time till W. and J. return, and I set about keeping my resolve, because
I will not quarrel with myself, and because I shall give William pleasure by
it when he comes again...."</p></blockquote>

<p>"Because I will not quarrel with myself!" She is full of such illuminations.
Here is another:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Sunday, June 1st.&mdash;After tea went to Ambleside round the lakes. A
very fine warm evening. Upon the side of Loughrigg <i>my heart dissolved in
what I saw</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Now here is her account of a country funeral which she reads into, or out
of, the countryside:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Wednesday, 3rd Sept.&mdash; ... a funeral at John Dawson's ...
I was affected to tears while we stood in the house, the coffin lying before me.
There were no near kindred, no children. When we got out of the dark
house the sun was shining, and the prospect looked as divinely beautiful
as I ever saw it. It seemed more sacred than I had ever seen it, <i>and yet more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
allied to human life</i>.... I thought she was going to a quiet spot, and
I could not help weeping very much...."</p></blockquote>

<p>The italics are mine. William was pleased to call her weeping "nervous
blubbering."</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>And then we come to 1802, the great last year of a twin life; the last year
of the five in which those two had lived as one soul and one heart. They
were at Dove Cottage, on something under £150 a year. Poems were thronging
thick about them; they were living intensely. John was alive. Mary
Hutchinson was at Sockburn. Coleridge was still Coleridge, not the bemused
and futile mystic he was to become. As for Dorothy, she lives a thing enskied,
floating from ecstasy to ecstasy. It is the third of March, and William is
to go to London. "Before we had quite finished breakfast Calvert's man
brought the horses for Wm. We had a deal to do, pens to make, poems to
put in order for writing, to settle for the press, pack up.... Since
he left me at half-past eleven (it is now two) I have been putting the drawers
into order, laid by his clothes, which he had thrown here and there and
everywhere, filed two months' newspapers, and got my dinner, two boiled
eggs and two apple tarts.... The robins are singing sweetly. Now
for my walk. I <i>will</i> be busy. I <i>will</i> look well, and be well when he comes back
to me. O the Darling! Here is one of his bitter apples. I can hardly find it
in my heart to throw it into the fire.... I walked round the two lakes,
crossed the stepping-stones at Rydalefoot. Sate down where we always
sit. I was full of thought of my darling. Blessings on him." Where else in
our literature will you find mood so tender, so intimately, so delicately
related?</p>

<p>A week later, and William returned. With him, it seems, her descriptive
powers. "Monday morning&mdash;a soft rain and mist. We walked to Rydale
for letters. The Vale looked very beautiful in excessive simplicity, yet,
at the same time, uncommon obscurity. The church stood alone, mountains
behind. The meadows looked calm and rich, bordering on the still lake.
Nothing else to be seen but lake and island." Exquisite landscape. For its
like we must go to Japan. Here is another. An interior. It is the 23rd of
March, "about ten o'clock, a quiet night. The fire flickers, and the watch
ticks. I hear nothing save the breathing of my beloved as he now and then
pushes his book forward, and turns over a leaf...." No more, but the
peace of it is profound, the art incomparable.</p>

<p>In April, between the 5th and 12th, William went into Yorkshire upon
an errand which she knew and dreaded. Her trouble makes the words throb.
"Monday, 12th.... The ground covered with snow. Walked to
T. Wilkinson's and sent for letters. The woman brought me one from
William and Mary. It was a sharp windy night. Thomas Wilkinson came
with me to Barton and questioned me like a catechiser all the way. Every
question was like the snapping of a little thread about my heart. I was so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
full of thought of my half-read letter and other things. I was glad when he
left me. Then I had time to look at the moon while I was thinking of my
own thoughts. The moon travelled through the clouds, tinging them yellow
as she passed along, with two stars near her, one larger than the other....
At this time William, as I found the next day, was riding by himself between
Middleham and Barnard Castle." I don't know where else to find the vague
torment of thought, its way of enhancing colour and form in nature, more
intensely observed. Next day: "When I returned <i>William</i> was come. <i>The
surprise shot through me</i>." This woman was not so much poet as crystal vase.
You can see the thought cloud and take shape.</p>

<p>The twin life was resumed for yet a little while. In the same month
come her descriptions of the daffodils in Gowbarrow Park, and of the scene
by Brothers Water, which prove to anybody in need of proof that she was
William's well-spring of poesy. Not that the journal is necessarily involved.
No need to suppose that he even read it. But that she could make him see,
and be moved by, what she had seen is proved by this: "17th....
I saw a robin chasing a scarlet butterfly this morning"; and "Sunday,
18th.... William wrote the poem on <i>The Robin and the Butterfly</i>."
No; beautiful beyond praise as the journals are, it is certain that she was
more beautiful than they. And what a discerning illuminative eye she had!
"As I lay down on the grass, I observed the glittering silver line on the
ridge of the backs of the sheep, owing to their situation respecting the sun,
which made them look beautiful, but with something of strangeness, like
animals of another kind, as if belonging to a more splendid world...."
What a woman to go a-gipsying through the world with!</p>

<p>Then comes the end.... "Thursday, 8th July.... In the
afternoon, after we had talked a little, William fell asleep. I read <i>The Winter's
Tale</i>; then I went to bed, but did not sleep. The swallows stole in and out
of their nest, and sat there, <i>whiles</i> quite still, <i>whiles</i> they sung low for two
minutes or more at a time, just like a muffled robin. William was looking at
<i>The Pedlar</i> when I got up. He arranged it, and after tea I wrote it out&mdash;280
lines.... The moon was behind.... We walked first to the
top of the hill to see Rydale. It was dark and dull, but our own vale was very
solemn&mdash;the shape of Helm Crag was quite distinct, though black. We
walked backwards and forwards on the White Moss path; there was a sky
like white brightness on the lake.... O beautiful place! Dear Mary,
William. The hour is come.... I must prepare to go. The swallows,
I must leave them, the wall, the garden, the roses, all. Dear creatures,
they sang last night after I was in bed; seemed to be singing to one another,
just before they settled to rest for the night. Well, I must go. Farewell."</p>

<p>Next day she set out with William to meet her secret dread, knowing
that life in Rydale could never be the same again. Wordsworth married
Mary Hutchinson on the 4th October, 1802. The secret is no secret now,
for Dorothy was a crystal vase.</p>

<p class="center b1">By ALDOUS HUXLEY</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IT</span> comes as something of a surprise to find that the niche reserved for
Ben Jonson in the "English Men of Letters" series has only now
been filled. One expected somehow that he would have been among
the first of the great ones to be enshrined; but no, he has had a long
time to wait; and Adam Smith, and Sydney Smith, and Hazlitt, and Fanny
Burney have gone before him into the temple of fame. Now, however,
his monument has at last been made, with Professor Gregory Smith's
qualified version of "O rare Ben Jonson!" duly and definitively carved
upon it.</p>

<p>What is it that makes us, almost as a matter of course, number Ben Jonson
among the great? Why should we expect him to be an early candidate for
immortality, or why, indeed, should he be admitted to the "English Men of
Letters" series at all? These are difficult questions to answer; for when we
come to consider the matter we find ourselves unable to give any very
glowing account of Ben or his greatness. It is hard to say that one likes his
work; one cannot honestly call him a good poet or a supreme dramatist.
And yet, unsympathetic as he is, uninteresting as he often can be, we still
go on respecting and admiring him, because, in spite of everything, we are
conscious, obscurely but certainly, that he was a great man.</p>

<p>He had little influence on his successors; the comedy of humours died
without any but an abortive issue. Shadwell, the mountain-bellied "Og, from
a treason tavern rolling home," is not a disciple that any man would have
much pride in claiming. No raking up of literary history will make Ben
Jonson great as a founder of a school or an inspirer of others. His greatness
is a greatness of character. There is something almost alarming in the
spectacle of this formidable figure advancing with tank-like irresistibility
towards the goal he had set himself to attain. No sirens of romance can
seduce him, no shock of opposition unseat him in his career. He proceeds
along the course theoretically mapped out at the inception of his literary
life, never deviating from this narrow way till the very end&mdash;till the time
when, in his old age, he wrote that exquisite pastoral, <i>The Sad Shepherd</i>,
which is so complete and absolute a denial of all his lifelong principles.
But <i>The Sad Shepherd</i> is a weakness, albeit a triumphant weakness. Ben,
as he liked to look upon himself, as he has again and again revealed
himself to us, is the artist with principles, protesting against the anarchic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
absence of principle among the geniuses and charlatans, the poets and
ranters of his age.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The true artificer will not run away from nature as he were afraid of
her: or depart from life and the likeness of truth; but speak to the capacity
of his hearers. And though his language differ from the vulgar somewhat,
it shall not fly from all humanity, with the Tamerlanes and Tamer-Chams
of the late age, which had nothing in them but the scenical strutting and
furious vociferation to warrant them to the ignorant gapers. He knows it
is his only art, so to carry it as none but artificers perceive it. In the
meantime, perhaps, he is called barren, dull, lean, a poor writer, or by what
contumelious word can come in their cheeks, by these men who without
labour, judgment, knowledge, or almost sense, are received or preferred
before him."</p></blockquote>

<p>In these sentences from <i>Discoveries</i> Ben Jonson paints his own picture&mdash;portrait
of the artist as a true artificer&mdash;setting forth, in its most general form,
and with no distracting details of the humours or the moral purpose of art,
his own theory of the artist's true function and nature. Jonson's theory was
no idle speculation, no mere thing of words and air, but a creed, a principle,
a categorical imperative, conditioning and informing his whole work. Any
study of the poet must, therefore, begin with the formulation of his theory,
and must go on, as Professor Gregory Smith's excellent essay does indeed
proceed, to show in detail how the theory was applied and worked out in
each individual composition.</p>

<p>A good deal of nonsense has been talked at one time or another about
artistic theories. The artist is told that he should have no theories, that he
should warble native wood-notes wild, that he should "sing," be wholly
spontaneous, should starve his brain and cultivate his heart and spleen;
that an artistic theory cramps the style, stops up the Helicons of inspiration,
and so on, and so on. The foolish and sentimental conception of the artist,
to which these anti-intellectual doctrines are a corollary, dates from the time
of romanticism and survives among the foolish and sentimental of to-day.
A consciously practised theory of art has never spoiled a good artist, has
never dammed up inspiration, but rather, and in most cases profitably,
canalised it. Even the Romantics had theories and were wild and emotional
on principle.</p>

<p>Theories are above all necessary at moments when old traditions are
breaking up, when all is chaos and in flux. At such moments an artist
formulates his theory and clings to it through thick and thin; clings to it as
the one firm raft of security in the midst of the surrounding unrest. Thus,
when the neo-Classicism, of which Ben was one of the remote ancestors, was
crumbling into the nothingness of <i>The Loves of the Plants</i> and <i>The Triumphs
of Temper</i>, Wordsworth found salvation by the promulgation of a new
theory of poetry, which he put into practice systematically and to the verge
of absurdity in <i>Lyrical Ballads</i>. Similarly in the shipwreck of the old tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
of painting we find the artists of the present day clinging desperately to
intellectual formulas as their only hope in the chaos. The only occasions, in
fact, when the artist can afford entirely to dispense with theory occur in
periods when a well-established tradition reigns supreme and unquestioned.
And then the absence of theory is more apparent than real; for the tradition
in which he is working is a theory, originally formulated by someone else,
which he accepts unconsciously and as though it were the law of nature
itself.</p>

<p>The beginning of the seventeenth century was not one of these periods
of placidity and calm acceptance. It was a moment of growth and decay
together, of fermentation. The fabulous efflorescence of the Renaissance had
already grown rank. With that extravagance of energy which characterised
them in all things, the Elizabethans had exaggerated the traditions of their
literature into insincerity. All artistic traditions end, in due course, by being
reduced to the absurd; but the Elizabethans crammed the growth and
decline of a century into a few years. One after another they transfigured
and then destroyed every species of art they touched. Euphuism,
Petrarchism, Spenserism, the sonnet, the drama&mdash;some lasted a little longer
than others, but they all exploded in the end, these beautiful iridescent
bubbles blown too big by the enthusiasm of their makers.</p>

<p>But in the midst of this unstable luxuriance voices of protest were to be
heard, reactions against the main romantic current were discernible. Each
in his own way and in his own sphere, Donne and Ben Jonson protested
against the exaggerations of the age. At a time when sonneteers in legions
were quibbling about the blackness of their ladies' eyes or the golden wires
of their hair, when Platonists protested in melodious chorus that they were
not in love with "red and white" but with the ideal and divine beauty
of which peach-blossom complexions were but inadequate shadows, at a
time when love-poetry had become, with rare exceptions, fantastically
unreal, Donne called it back, a little grossly perhaps, to facts with the dry
remark:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Love's not so pure and abstract as they use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To say, who have <i>no mistress</i> but their muse.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">There have been poets who have written more lyrically than Donne, more
fervently about certain amorous emotions, but not one who has formulated
so rational a philosophy of love as a whole, who has seen all the facts so
clearly and judged of them so soundly. Donne laid down no literary theory.
His followers took from him all that was relatively unimportant&mdash;the harshness,
itself a protest against Spenserian facility, the conceits, the sensuality
tempered by mysticism&mdash;but the important and original quality of Donne's
work, the psychological realism, they could not, through sheer incapacity,
transfer into their own poetry. Donne's immediate influence was on the
whole bad. Any influence for good he may have had has been on poets of a
much later date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
The other great literary Protestant of the time was the curious subject of
our examination, Ben Jonson. Like Donne he was a realist. He had no use
for claptrap, or rant, or romanticism. His aim was to give his audiences real
facts flavoured with sound morality. He failed to be a great realist, partly
because he lacked the imaginative insight to perceive more than the most
obvious and superficial reality, and partly because he was so much preoccupied
with the sound morality that he was prepared to sacrifice truth to
satire; so that in place of characters he gives us humours, not minds, but
personified moral qualities.</p>

<p>Ben hated romanticism; for, whatever may have been his bodily habits,
however infinite his capacity for drinking sack, he belonged intellectually to
the party of sobriety. In all ages the drunks and the sobers have confronted
one another, each party loud in derision and condemnation of the defects
which it observes in the other. "The Tamerlanes and Tamer-Chams of the
late age" accuse the sober Ben of being "barren, dull, lean, a poor writer."
Ben retorts that they "have nothing in them but the scenical strutting and
furious vociferation to warrant them to the ignorant gapers." At another
period it is the Hernanis and the Rollas who reproach that paragon of
dryness, the almost fiendishly sober Stendhal, with his grocer's style.
Stendhal in his turn remarks: "En paraissant, vers 1803, le <i>Génie</i> de
Chateaubriand m'a semblé ridicule." And to-day? We have our sobers and
our drunks, our Hardy and our Belloc, and Chesterton. The distinction is
universally and eternally valid. Our personal sympathies may lie with one or
the other; but it is obvious that we could dispense with neither. Ben, then,
was one of the sobers, protesting with might and main against the extravagant
behaviour of the drunks, an intellectual insisting that there was no way of
arriving at truth except by intellectual processes, an apotheosis of the Plain
Man determined to stand no nonsense about anything. Ben's poetical
achievement, such as it is, is the achievement of one who relied on no
mysterious inspiration, but on those solid qualities of sense, perseverance,
and sound judgment which any decent citizen of a decent country may be
expected to possess. That he himself possessed, hidden somewhere in the
obscure crypts and recesses of his mind, other rarer spiritual qualities is
proved by the existence of his additions to <i>The Spanish Tragedy</i>&mdash;if, indeed,
they are his, which there is no cogent reason to doubt&mdash;and his last fragment
of a masterpiece, <i>The Sad Shepherd</i>. But these qualities, as Professor Gregory
Smith points out, he seems deliberately to have suppressed; locked them
away, at the bidding of his imperious theory, in the strange dark places from
which, at the beginning and the very end of his career, they emerged. He
might have been a great romantic, one of the sublime inebriates; he chose
rather to be classical and sober. Working solely with the logical intellect and
rejecting as dangerous the aid of those uncontrolled illogical elements of
imagination, he produced work that is in its own way excellent. It is well-wrought,
strong, heavy with learning and what the Chaucerians would call
"high sentence." The emotional intensity and brevity excepted, it possesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
all the qualities of the French classical drama. But the quality which
characterises the best Elizabethan and indeed the best English poetry of all
periods, the power of moving in two worlds at once, it lacks. Jonson, like the
French dramatists of the seventeenth century, moves on a level, directly
towards some logical goal. The road over which his great contemporaries
take us is not level; it is, as it were, tilted and uneven, so that as we proceed
along it we are momently shot off at a tangent from the solid earth of logical
meaning into superior regions where the intellectual laws of gravity have no
control. The mistake of Jonson and the classicists in general consists in
supposing that nothing is of value that is not susceptible of logical analysis;
whereas the truth is that the greatest triumphs of art take place in a world
that is not wholly of the intellect, but lies somewhere between it and the
inenarrable, but, to those who have penetrated it, supremely real, world of the
mystic. In his fear and dislike of nonsense, Jonson put away from himself
not only the Tamer-Chams and the fustian of the late age, but also most of
the beauty it had created.</p>

<p>With the romantic emotions of his predecessors and contemporaries
Jonson abandoned much of the characteristically Elizabethan form of their
poetry. That extraordinary melodiousness which distinguishes the
Elizabethan lyric is not to be found in any of Ben's writing. The poems by
which we remember him&mdash;<i>Cynthia</i>, <i>Drink to Me Only</i>, <i>It is Not Growing
Like a Tree</i>&mdash;are classically well made (though the cavalier lyrists were to do
better in the same style); but it is not for any musical qualities that we
remember them. One can understand Ben's critical contempt for those
purely formal devices for producing musical richness in which the
Elizabethans delighted.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eyes, why did you bring unto me these graces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grac'd to yield wonder out of her true measure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Measure of all joyes' stay to phansie traces<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Module of pleasure.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The device is childish in its formality, the words, in their obscurity,
almost devoid of significance. But what matter, since the stanza is a triumph
of sonorous beauty? The Elizabethans devised many ingenuities of this
sort; the minor poets exploited them until they became ridiculous; the
major poets employed them with greater discretion, playing subtle variations
(as in Shakespeare's sonnets) on the crude theme. When writers had something
to say, their thoughts, poured into these copiously elaborate forms,
were moulded to the grandest poetical eloquence. A minor poet, like Lord
Brooke, from whose works we have just quoted a specimen of pure
formalism, could produce, in his moments of inspiration, such magnificent
lines as:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mind of Man is this world's true dimension,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And knowledge is the measure of the mind;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">or these, of the nethermost hell:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A place there is upon no centre placed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deepe under depthes, as farre as is the skie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the earth; darke, infinitely spaced:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pluto the king, the kingdome, miserie.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Even into comic poetry the Elizabethans imported the grand manner.
The anonymous author of</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Tee-hee, tee-hee! Oh sweet delight!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tickles this age, who can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call Tullia's ape a marmosite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Leda's goose a swan,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">knew the secret of that rich, facile music which all those who wrote in the
grand Elizabethan tradition could produce. Jonson, like Donne, reacted
against the facility and floridity of this technique, but in a different way.
Donne's protest took the form of a conceited subtlety of thought combined
with a harshness of metre. Jonson's classical training inclined him towards
clarity, solidity of sense, and economy of form. He stands, as a lyrist, halfway
between the Elizabethans and the cavalier song-writers; he has broken away
from the old tradition, but has not yet made himself entirely at home in the
new. At the best he achieves a minor perfection of point and neatness. At
the worst he falls into that dryness and dullness with which he knew he could
be reproached.</p>

<p>We have seen from the passage concerning the true artificer that Jonson
fully realised the risk he was running. He recurs more than once in
<i>Discoveries</i> to the same theme, "Some men to avoid redundancy run into
that [a "thin, flagging, poor, starved" style]; and while they strive to have
no ill-blood or juice, they lose their good." The good that Jonson lost was
a great one. And in the same way we see to-day how a fear of becoming
sentimental, or "chocolate-boxy," drives many of the younger poets and
artists to shrink from treating of the great emotions or the obvious lavish
beauty of the earth. But to eschew a good because the corruption of it is
very bad is surely a sign of weakness and a folly.</p>

<p>Having lost the realm of romantic beauty&mdash;lost it deliberately and of set
purpose&mdash;Ben Jonson devoted the whole of his immense energy to portraying
and reforming the ugly world of fact. But his reforming satiric intentions
interfered, as we have already shown, with his realistic intentions, and instead
of re-creating in his art the actual world of men, he invented the wholly
intellectual and therefore wholly unreal universe of Humours. It is an odd
new world, amusing to look at from the safe distance that separates stage from
stalls; but not a place one could ever wish to live in&mdash;one's neighbours,
fools, knaves, hypocrites, and bears would make the most pleasing prospect
intolerable. And over it all is diffused the atmosphere of Jonson's humour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
It is a curious kind of humour, very different from anything that passes
under that name to-day, from the humour of <i>Punch</i>, or <i>A Kiss for Cinderella</i>.
One has only to read <i>Volpone</i>&mdash;or, better still, go to see it when it is acted
this year by the Phœnix Society for the revival of old plays&mdash;to realise
that Ben's conception of a joke differed materially from ours. Humour has
never been the same since Rousseau invented humanitarianism. Syphilis and
broken legs were still a great deal more comic in Smollett's day than in our
own. There is a cruelty, a heartlessness about much of the older humour
which is sometimes shocking, sometimes, in its less extreme forms,
pleasantly astringent and stimulating after the orgies of quaint pathos and
sentimental comedy in which we are nowadays forced to indulge. There is
not a pathetic line in <i>Volpone</i>; all the characters are profoundly unpleasant,
and the fun is almost as grim as fun can be. Its heartlessness is not the
brilliant, cynical heartlessness of the later Restoration comedy, but something
ponderous and vast. It reminds us of one of those enormous, painful
jokes which fate sometimes plays on humanity. There is no alleviation, no
purging by pity and terror. It requires a very hearty sense of humour to
digest it. We have reason to admire our ancestors for their ability to enjoy
this kind of comedy as it should be enjoyed. It would get very little appreciation
from a London audience of to-day.</p>

<p>In the other comedies the fun is not so grim; but there is a certain
hardness and brutality about them all&mdash;due, of course, ultimately to the fact
that the characters are not human, but rather marionettes of wood and metal
that collide and belabour one another, like the ferocious puppets of the
Punch and Judy show, without feeling the painfulness of the proceeding.
Shakespeare's comedy is not heartless, because the characters are human and
sensitive. Our modern sentimentality is a corruption, a softening of genuine
humanity. We need a few more Jonsons and Congreves, some more plays
like <i>Volpone</i>, or that inimitable <i>Mariage à la Mode</i> of Dryden, in which the
curtain goes up on a lady singing the outrageously cynical song that begins:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Why should a foolish marriage vow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That long ago was made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Constrain us to each other now<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When pleasure is decayed?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Too much heartlessness is intolerable (how soon one turns, revolted, from
the literature of the Restoration!), but a little of it now and then is bracing,
a tonic for relaxed sensibilities. A little ruthless laughter clears the air as
nothing else can do; it is good for us, every now and then, to see our ideals
laughed at, our conception of nobility caricatured; it is good for solemnity's
nose to be tweaked, it is good for human pomposity to be made to look
mean and ridiculous. This should be the great social function&mdash;as Marinetti
has pointed out&mdash;of the music halls, to provide this cruel and unsparing
laughter, to make a buffoonery of all the solemnly-accepted grandeurs and
nobilities. A good dose of this mockery, administered twice a year at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
equinoxes, should purge our minds of much waste matter, make nimble our
spirits and brighten the eye to look more clearly and truthfully on the
world about us.</p>

<p>Ben's reduction of human beings to a series of rather unpleasant Humours
is sound and medicinal. Humours do not, of course, exist in actuality; they
are true only as caricatures are true. There are times when we wonder
whether a caricature is not, after all, truer than a photograph; there are
others when it seems a stupid lie. But at all times a caricature is disquieting;
and it is very good for most of us to be made uncomfortable.</p>

<h2>STEPHEN CRANE</h2>

<p class="center b0"><i>A Note Without Dates</i></p>

<p class="center b1">By JOSEPH CONRAD</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">MY</span> acquaintance with Crane was brought about by Mr. S. S.
Pawling, partner in the publishing firm of Mr. William
Heinemann.</p>

<p>One day Mr. Pawling said to me: "Stephen Crane has
arrived in England. I asked him if there was anybody he wanted to meet
and he mentioned two names. One of them was yours." I had then just
been reading, like the rest of the world, Crane's <i>Red Badge of Courage</i>. The
subject of that story was war, from the point of view of an individual
soldier's emotions. That individual (he remains nameless throughout) was
interesting enough in himself, but on turning over the pages of that little
book which had for the moment secured such a noisy recognition I had
been even more interested in the personality of the writer. The picture of a
simple and untried youth becoming through the needs of his country part
of a great fighting machine was presented with an earnestness of purpose, a
sense of tragic issues, and an imaginative force of expression which struck
me as quite uncommon and altogether worthy of admiration.</p>

<p>Apparently Stephen Crane had received a favourable impression from
reading the <i>Nigger of the Narcissus</i>, a book of mine which had also been
published lately. I was truly pleased to hear this.</p>

<p>On my next visit to town we met at a lunch. I saw a young man of medium
stature and slender build, with very steady, penetrating blue eyes, the eyes
of a being who not only sees visions but can brood over them to some purpose.</p>

<p>He had indeed a wonderful power of vision, which he applied to the things
of this earth and of our mortal humanity with a penetrating force that
seemed to reach within life's appearances and forms the very spirit of their
truth. His ignorance of the world at large&mdash;he had seen very little of it&mdash;did
not stand in the way of his imaginative grasp of facts, events, and
picturesque men.</p>

<p>His manner was very quiet, his personality at first sight interesting, and
he talked slowly with an intonation which on some people, mainly
Americans, had, I believe, a jarring effect. But not on me. Whatever he said
had a personal note, and he expressed himself with a graphic simplicity
which was extremely engaging. He knew little of literature, either of his
own country or of any other, but he was himself a wonderful artist in
words whenever he took a pen into his hand. Then his gift came out&mdash;and
it was seen to be much more than mere felicity of language. His impressionism
of phrase went really deeper than the surface. In his writing he was
very sure of his effects. I don't think he was ever in doubt about what he
could do. Yet it often seemed to me that he was but half aware of the
exceptional quality of his achievement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
This achievement was curtailed by his early death. It was a great loss
to his friends, but perhaps not so much to literature. I think that he had
given his measure fully in the few books he had the time to write. Let
me not be misunderstood: the loss was great, but it was the loss of
the delight his art could give, not the loss of any further possible
revelation. As to himself, who can say how much he gained or lost
by quitting so early this world of the living, which he knew how to set
before us in terms of his own artistic vision? Perhaps he did not lose a
great deal. The recognition he was accorded was rather languid and given
him grudgingly. The worthiest welcome he secured for his tales in this
country was from Mr. W. Henley in the <i>New Review</i> and later, towards
the end of his life, from the late Mr. William Blackwood in his magazine.
For the rest I must say that during his sojourn in England he had the
misfortune to be, as the French say, <i>mal entouré</i>. He was beset by people
who understood not the quality of his genius and were antagonistic to the
deeper fineness of his nature. Some of them have died since, but dead
or alive they are not worth speaking about now. I don't think he had
any illusions about them himself; yet there was a strain of good-nature and
perhaps of weakness in his character which prevented him from shaking
himself free from their worthless and patronising attentions, which in those
days caused me much secret irritation whenever I stayed with him in either
of his English homes. My wife and I like best to remember him riding to
meet us at the gate of the Park at Brede. Born master of his sincere impressions
he was also a born horseman. He never appeared so happy or so
much to advantage as on the back of a horse. He had formed the project of
teaching my eldest boy to ride and meantime, when the child was about
two years old, presented him with his first dog.</p>

<p>I saw Stephen Crane a few days after his first arrival in London. I saw
him for the last time on his last day in England. It was in Dover, in a big
hotel, in a bedroom with a large window looking on to the sea. He had been
very ill and Mrs. Crane was taking him to some place in Germany, but one
glance at that wasted face was enough to tell me that it was the most forlorn
of all hopes. The last words he breathed out to me were: "I am tired.
Give my love to your wife and child." When I stopped at the door for
another look I saw that he had turned his head on the pillow and was
staring wistfully out of the window at the sails of a cutter yacht that glided
slowly across the frame, like a dim shadow against a grey sky.</p>

<p>Those who have read his little tale, <i>Horses</i>, and the story, <i>The Open Boat</i>,
in the volume of that name, know with what fine understanding he loved
horses and the sea. And his passage on this earth was like that of a horseman
riding swiftly in the dawn of a day fated to be short and without sunshine.</p>

<h3 class="left">GENERAL NOTES</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">ONE</span> of the great autobiographies, and a very important document for any
one who undertakes the most rudimentary study of the English romantic
movement, is the <i>Life of B. R. Haydon</i>, drawn from his journals. He was
the friend of Keats, Lamb, Wordsworth, Leigh Hunt; he moved in
many different spheres, among Dukes and politicians, and artists, and
the debtors in King's Bench Prison. A man of boundless energy, an able writer
capable of rendering his impressions vividly and with force, he was, indeed, everything
but what he believed himself with passionate faith to be, what he even
succeeded in persuading others that he was&mdash;a great painter. He was convinced&mdash;as
firmly convinced as of the fact that two and two are four&mdash;that he was a genius as
overwhelmingly great as Michael Angelo. He was, as a matter of fact, one of the
second-rate romantic painters of the early nineteenth century, in some things a little
better, in others a good deal worse, than his contemporaries in the same line of trade.
The book is a fascinating study in psychology as well as one of the most vivid pictures
of an interesting society. It is, therefore, unfortunate that it should now be a matter of
some difficulty to lay one's hand on a copy. The first edition of the book appeared in
1853, the second and last some ten years later&mdash;more than half a century ago. We
venture to express the pious hope that some beneficent publisher will reprint what is
certainly one of the most peculiar human and historical documents of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>We learn from Mr. Leslie Chaundy, of Oxford, that he has purchased intact the whole
library of the late Provost of Worcester. Dr. Daniel's collection comprises a great number
of rare and interesting books, including, of course, all the volumes issued from the
famous Daniel Press. A catalogue is, we understand, in course of preparation and will
be issued shortly.</p>

<p>October 31st saw the publication of the first number of the <i>Bookman's Journal and
Print Collector</i>, qualified in a sub-title as <i>The Journal for the Trade, for Collectors, and
for Libraries</i>. "Our aim," we read in the editorial, "is to be useful, not ornamental.
Booksellers, publishers, librarians, and collectors alike from all parts of the country
have agreed with the need for such a journal as this, and have given us generous support."
The magazine contains reviews, a library supplement of "New Publications and Reprints
of the Week," miscellaneous articles and notes on books and booksellers, prints and
engravings. A useful feature of the journal will be the series of complete bibliographies
of modern authors which it is proposed to publish. The first is devoted to the works of
Hubert Crackanthorpe, who died in 1896, aged only twenty-six. Similar bibliographies
of Masefield, Galsworthy, Conrad, Gissing, George Moore, and Merrick are in preparation.
Those who wish to buy or sell books will be interested in the "Books Wanted"
and "Books for Sale" columns of advertisements. Altogether, we think that this little
paper will have no difficulty in substantiating its claims and will prove very valuable to
all book-lovers.</p>

Another interesting event in the world of books is the opening of the Chelsea Book
Club at 65 Cheyne Walk. "It is being founded," we are told, "in the belief that in bookselling
selection and specialisation are essential. It will aim, therefore, at having a stock
of those books, new and second-hand, English and foreign, dealing with Belles Lettres
and Art which appear to be most worthy of study and appreciation." A reading-room
for the use of members will be attached to the club, in which lectures and exhibitions
of works of art will be held from time to time. Those who wish to have further
particulars as to membership, country book-service, lectures and exhibitions are asked
to apply to the Secretary, 65 Cheyne Walk, London, S.W.3.</p>

<p>At the sale, by Messrs. Sotheby, of the late Mr. W. J. Leighton's stock, to which we
referred last month, a copy of Walton's <i>Compleat Angler</i> (1655) fetched £21 10<i>s.</i>; <i>The
Pricke of Conscience</i>, fifteenth century M.S., £50; <i>Myrrour and Description of the
Worlde</i>, printed by Laurence Andrews, <i>circa</i> 1530, £72. Important auction sales in the
month of November were Messrs. Sotheby's sale of the late Sir Frank Crisp's library
and the sale of Mr. Christie Miller's library on the 28th of the month. We shall have
gone to press before the results of the sale are known. What will be paid for Lot 81, we
wonder<i>?&mdash;Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, and Tragedies</i>, the first
edition, folio, 1623.</p>

<p>The Christie-Miller library contains many other books of extraordinary interest,
among them three unique copies of works by Nicholas Breton: <i>A Smale Handfull of
Fragrant Flowers, Selected and Gathered out of the Lovely Garden of Sacred Scripture</i>;
<i>A Floorish upon Fancie</i>, <i>As Gallant a Glose upon so Triflinge a Text as ever was Written</i>;
and <i>The Workes of a Young Wit Trust up with a Fardell of Prettie Fancies</i>. Robert
Greene is represented by three unique copies, one of <i>Gwydonius</i>, and another of
<i>Arbasto, The Anatomie of Fortune</i>; and the third of the earliest edition of <i>A Quip for
an Upstart Courtier</i>, containing the passage, suppressed in all the later editions, in abuse
of Gabriel Harvey and his brothers, which started the literary war between Greene and
the pedant of Cambridge.</p>

<h3 class="left">ITEMS FROM THE BOOKSELLERS' CATALOGUES</h3>

<p>It is possible, with a bundle of booksellers' catalogues, to waste more time more
pleasantly than in any other way. As one idly turns the pages, catching sight here and
there of a strange title or a book on some impossibly queer subject, one realises, more
fully than one could do in years of social intercourse with one's fellow-men, how
fantastic a thing is the human mind&mdash;a stable full of prancing hobby-horses for crochety
horsemen to ride about the world. We can speculate pleasantly on the character
of the practical parson who wrote the <i>Clergyman's Intelligencer; or, a Compleat Alphabetical
List of all the Patrons in England and Wales, with the ... Benefices in their
Gift and their Valuation Annexed</i> (1745), for which Mr. Mayhew asks 5<i>s.</i> In the same
catalogue is offered that curiosity in the history of science, P. H. Gosse's <i>Creation
(Omphalus); an Attempt to Untie the Geological Knot</i>, published in 1857, two years
before the <i>Origin of Species</i>. The title, <i>Ode to the Duke of Wellington and Other Poems,
Written Between the Ages of Eleven and Thirteen Years</i>, by Robert Charles Dallas (1819),
calls up visions of some tight-trousered infant prodigy; and we wish that the book were
not an example of fine binding, and that Mr. Chaundy could part with it for less than
30<i>s.</i> Just above the infant, alphabetically and perhaps also in order of merit, we find<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
the name of D'Adelsward, the author of a volume of poems (of which, in our ignorance,
we had never heard) entitled <i>Les Cortèges Qui Sont Passés</i>. The volume, which was
published in 1903, is bound in pink watered silk, and costs four guineas. We have a
vision of something even more prodigious than the infant of 1819.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Mr. Chaundy has a number of first editions of Disraeli's novels for sale. The very
scarce <i>Contarini Fleming</i> (1832) is priced at £6; <i>The Voyage of Captain Popanilla</i> (1828)
at 35<i>s.</i>; <i>Vivian Grey</i> (1826) at 21<i>s.</i>; <i>Venetia</i> (1837) at 20<i>s.</i> A first edition of Borrow's
<i>Wild Wales</i>, in three volumes (1862), is offered by Messrs. Heffer, of Cambridge, for
£9 <i>9s.</i> It is almost worth paying that for the sake of the description, at the beginning of
the book, of the negro who sat on the walls of Chester, spitting into the void. You can
have George Eliot for a good deal less. Mr. James Miles, of Leeds, has a <i>Silas Marner</i>
(first edition, 1861) for 25<i>s.</i> First editions of Robert Bridges are, we notice, priced a
good deal higher than the later firsts of Robert Browning. <i>Eros and Psyche</i> costs 15<i>s.</i>
at Messrs. Heffer's, and <i>Prince Hohenstiel-Schwangan</i> only 5<i>s.</i> The four volumes of
the first edition of <i>The Ring and the Book</i> (1868) cost one 32<i>s.</i> at the same
bookseller's.</p>

<p>Similarly Conrad firsts are more precious than Bennetts, if we may judge from the
fact that <i>Hilda Lessways</i> (1911) costs 7<i>s.</i> at Mr. Chaundy's shop, while <i>Chance</i> and
<i>Victory</i> (novels of Mr. Conrad's corresponding period), at Messrs. Heffer's, are priced
at 12<i>s.</i> and 9<i>s.</i> respectively, and the precious <i>Almayer's Folly</i> of 1895 costs £3 3<i>s.</i></p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Mr. P. J. Dobell has already done good work in the field of bibliography. The catalogue
published by him last year, under the title, <i>The Literature of the Restoration</i>, was a
useful guide for all students of the period. He has now issued a supplementary catalogue
of works connected with the Popish Plot.</p>

<p>Most of the pamphlets which he offers for sale are unknown to us; but here and
there we light on an old friend. We can remember laughing heartily over <i>A Modest
Vindication of the Earl of S[haftesbur]y, in a Letter to a Friend Concerning His Being
Elected King of Poland</i>. The ironical eulogy of Shaftesbury with which the pamphlet
begins is an admirable piece of satire. The Earl is praised for "his unshaken obedience
to every Government he has been concerned in or lived under; his steady adherence
to every religion that had but hopes to be established." It is interesting to note that in
this pamphlet, written after the production of the <i>Spanish Friar</i>, and before the publication
of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>, Dryden is regarded as a Whig poet. For the new King of
Poland appoints "Jean Drydenurtzitz to be our Poet Laureate for writing panegyrics
upon Oliver Cromwell and libels against his present master, King Charles II. of
England." The deputy Laureate is no less a person than "Tom Shadworiski," or Shadwell,
Dryden's most bitter enemy in the later years of the Plot. Mr. Dobell's price for
the pamphlet is 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> Two pamphlets in this collection refer to the fantastic rector
of All Saints', Colchester&mdash;Edmund Hickeringill, one time chaplain in the Scottish
regiments of the Commonwealth, and the author of the first retort to <i>The Medal, The
Mushroom</i>, which was written and sent to press on the day following the publication of
Dryden's poem&mdash;a feat of composition which he modestly suggests was due to divine
inspiration.</p>

<p><i>Great News from the Old-Bayly, Mr. Gar's Recantation; or, the True Protestant
Renegade, the Courantier Turn'd Tony</i>, sounds interesting. Henry Care had the distinction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
of being the first to reply to <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>. His <i>Towzer the Second</i> was
published three weeks after the appearance of the <i>Tory Satire</i>, for Care was a true blue
Protestant in those days. "His breeding," says Anthony Wood, "was in the nature of
a Petty Fogger, a little despicable wretch ... a poor snivelling fellow." He was
a poor literary hack, and at James II.'s accession, "for bread and money sake, and
nothing else," he went over to the side in power and turned his pen against the
Protestants.</p>

<p>Three pamphlets deal with Roger L'Estrange, or "Towzer," as he was nicknamed
by his enemies. But there is one enchanting ballad entitled "<i>A New Ballad on an Old
Dog (Towzer) that Writes Strange-lee</i>," of which Mr. Dobell does not seem to have a
copy. We could wish that we had space to quote it. But we have embarked on a subject
which needs treating at length. The literary history of the Popish Plot remains to be
written. A volume of extracts joined together by explanatory notes, biographical,
political, and critical, would be a thing of absorbing interest.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We notice, by the way, in Mr. Dobell's catalogue that <i>The London Mercury, or
Moderate Intelligencer</i>, from December 24th to 27th, 1688, may be purchased for 5<i>s.</i>
It is to be hoped that the intelligence of its namesake of to-day will prove more than
moderate.</p>

<h2 class="gesperrt b0">CORRESPONDENCE</h2>

<h3 class="p0 b0">THE TEACHING OF ENGLISH</h3>

<p class="center b1">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;All schoolmasters and schoolmistresses will be grateful to you for your services
to a great cause in allowing Mr. J. C. Stobart to talk at length on the teaching of English,
but I was surprised to find myself selected as his scapegoat and "guillotined in distinguished
company" (that of the old <i>régime</i>). My colleagues will be amused at that.
Unfortunately Mr. Stobart is not a very skilful executioner. He tries to show that in
my <i>English Course</i> I have followed the traditional methods in "thoroughly normal
chapters." And yet he does allow that I am "trying to shake off a yoke which is not
entirely congenial" to me. It is more than ten years since I shook off the yoke which
he describes as uncongenial. "The traditional method," he says, "begins with the
copybook and proceeds by way of dictation and formal exercises to its goal in the
essay." I do <i>not</i> advocate the use of the copybook for the simple reason that copybooks
insist on the Vere Foster type of handwriting, while I require from my pupils an
artistic caligraphy which is opposed in every particular to the uniform ugliness of the
old Board School and present Army Council standard.</p>

<p>Dictation I use most sparingly, though I certainly do prefer a boy to leave me with
an elementary knowledge of punctuation and a slight acquaintance with the more
normal forms of spelling rather than with a contempt for or slavish adoration of stops,
and a phonetic system of spelling which is intelligible and phonetic to no one but
himself. The reading that I advocate, both in my book and in practice, is not limited
(has Mr. Stobart himself read <i>all</i> the books that I recommended as useful for boys?),
and the text is never obscured with comment. Where did he get this false information
from? To definite grammar I assigned four and a half pages out of 500, which
exactly expresses my opinion of its importance. Having misrepresented me in every
detail so far, Mr. Stobart proceeds to attack me on two sides at once. "If you ask the
schoolmaster why he makes his English the dullest subject in the syllabus, he will
probably answer that he is preparing for the London matriculation." I am both a
schoolmaster and the English examiner for the "Matric." I will pay Mr. Stobart's first-class
return fare from his home to Tonbridge and board him for a week if he will visit
my English classes and at the end of his stay retain that word "dullest" in all sincerity.
I cannot believe that it is only I who enjoy these English hours so whole-heartedly.
I certainly should find them dull if I were proceeding on "traditional" lines, either in
my book or in the class-room.... I am next taken to task for daring to
teach observation and originality. Mr. Stobart rather rudely (I wish he would practise
gentleness and love himself) calls my methods here "a generous diet of cold minced
hash." It is "up" to him to prove it. The point is, do I or do I not achieve observation
and originality by my methods? Come down to Tonbridge, Mr. Stobart, and I will let
you judge for yourself.</p>

<p>When, therefore, you suggest that every boy should learn how to express himself
freely and to read widely, I can only reply that every boy has been doing so with very
great advantage for years. You cannot picture a Public Schoolmaster so zealous for the
purity of his own tongue that he treats a misplaced "and which" or "unrelated
participle" as a personal affront. You cannot have been inside a Public School class-room
for "donkey's years." I can show you scores as devoted to our classics as Whitelaw
was to <i>Latin and Greek</i>?&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The author of <i>Specimens of Macaronic Poetry</i>, published by J. Richard Beckley
in 1831, is William Sandys, F.S.A. (1791&ndash;1874). He was a barrister of Gray's Inn, and
a member of the law firm of Sandys and Knott, of Gray's Inn Square. He was born and
died in London, and, in addition to the book mentioned above, was the author of
<i>A Short History of Freemasonry</i> (1829), <i>Christmas Carols</i> (1833), and a few other books,
a full bibliography of which will be found in <i>Bibliotheca Cornubiensis</i>. He was an enthusiastic
musical amateur from youth, and further biographical particulars will be found
in the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i>.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;<i>Specimens of Macaronic Poetry</i>, to which reference is made on page 74 of your
last issue, is chiefly remarkable for its interesting introduction to the subject and to the
fact that most of the specimens printed are, or were at the date of publication, rarely
met with.</p>

<p>The epic which you mention first is discussed on page 17 of the introduction, where
it is said to be an imitation of Folengo. I have not been able to trace the author, but it
bears many evidences of having been written by Folengo himself. The ode was written
by Dr. Geddes, and the author of the old Scottish Testament was Wm. Dunbar, whose
name is printed at the end of the verses in my copy.</p>

<p>Macaronic Poetry creates but little interest in these days, though there are still
students who appreciate some of its qualities.</p>

<p>If "A. L. H." is interested, I am sure that an article on the subject would be read

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;What does "A. L. H." mean by "no" author's name is given? The <i>editor's</i>
of the book&mdash;or the author's of Mr. Andro Kennedy?</p>

<p>The latter is, of course, my compatriot, William Dunbar, but neither of my editions
of him mentions this poem's having been printed in that particular book.</p>

<p>Also, your reviewer of Wilde, on page 91, begins, quite in error, saying that the book
has no indication of how it came into existence or who chose them for republication.
The wrapper, cover, and title-page, all three, say, "Being extracts from Reviews
and Miscellanies" (one of those large white volumes on hand-made paper that smelt
so of bad paste, published by Methuen in 1912); while behind the title-page is, "This
selection has been made by Mr. E. V. Lucas." The best thing in it is, I think, the

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;With regard to your query in No. 1, as to who was the author of <i>Specimens of
Macaronic Poetry</i>, I think I can supply the answer. After reading your paragraph on the
subject I took down the book from its shelf and found that my father, the late Dr.
Henry B. Wheatley, had pencilled on the title-page the name of Sandys. I then turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
to Lowndes and found the book under the name of William Sandys. The <i>Dictionary
of National Biography</i> states that the author was born in 1792 and died in 1874, and
that he is best remembered for his share in Sandys' and Forster's <i>History of the Violin</i>,
1864. The <i>Specimens</i>, published in 1831, was his second venture in authorship. My
father evidently bought the book when he was engaged in writing his own first book
<i>Of Anagrams</i>, containing in the introduction (I quote from the title-page) "numerous
specimens of Macaronic poetry, Punning Mottoes, Rhopalic, Shaped, Equivocal, Lyon,
and Echo Verses, Alliteration, Acrostics, Lipograms, Chronograms, Logograms, Palindromes,
and Bouls' Rimes." To any one interested in queer forms of verse this book is full
of entertainment. It was published in 1872, and is now out of print.</p>

<p>In the first of your Bibliographical Notes, in which you notice Mr. Percy Simpson's
edition of <i>Every Man in His Humour</i>, you say, "A new edition of Ben Jonson's work
is certainly needed: Gifford's, re-edited by Cunningham, is sadly inadequate." I have
not yet had the pleasure of reading Mr. Simpson's book, but I would point out that
Gifford's edition was not the only predecessor. An edition of Ben Jonson's play was
edited, with an introduction and critical apparatus, by my father in 1877, for the "London
Series of English Classics," edited by J. W. Hales, M.A., and J. S. Jerram, M.A., and
published by Longmans, Green &amp; Co. The excellent introduction contains, besides the
facts of Jonson's life, a lucid explanation and examination of the Comedy of Humours,
together with a critical comparison of the various editions. The notes are adequate, and
placed at the end of the book. It was a labour of love, and, although doubtless scholarship
has advanced since it was published, my filial partiality compels me to think that it still
ranks as a worthy edition of this classic of our literature.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h3>POETRY</h3>

<h4 class="left">GEORGIAN POETRY, 1918&ndash;1919 Edited by E. M. The Poetry Bookshop
6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The new collection of <i>Georgian Poetry</i> contains specimens of the work of nineteen
poets, fourteen of whom have appeared in one or more of the previous volumes of the
series, while five are represented for the first time. The fourteen are Mr. Lascelles
Abercrombie, Mr. Gordon Bottomley, Mr. W. H. Davies, Mr. Walter de la Mare,
Mr. John Drinkwater, Mr. John Freeman, Mr. W. W. Gibson, Mr. Robert Graves,
Mr. D. H. Lawrence, Mr. Harold Monro, Mr. Robert Nichols, Mr. Siegfried Sassoon,
Mr. J. C. Squire, and Mr. W. J. Turner. The five are Mr. Francis Brett Young, Mr.
Thomas Moult, Mr. J. D. C. Pellow, Mr. Edward Shanks, and Mrs. Fredegond Shove.
On account of their editorial connection with the <span class="smcap">London Mercury</span>, the contributions of
Mr. Squire and Mr. Shanks will not receive further mention in this notice.</p>

<p>"I hope," observes E. M. in his preface, "that [the present volume] may be thought
to show that what for want of a better word is called Peace has not interfered with the
writing of good poetry." Certainly many critics have supposed that war was the prime
generator of what they admit to be a new movement in poetry. But the anthologist's
hope is justified, on <i>a priori</i> grounds at least, by the fact that the movement began,
however tentatively, before the late war. The first collection of <i>Georgian Poetry</i> appeared
in 1912, when the title expressed an act of faith, based on an act of divination, which
has since been confirmed. A comparison of the four members of the series suggests
that what, for want of a better word, has received this name, is still in a state of slow
development towards a certain community of spirit and attitude, which does not however
connote any uniformity of style. In the third volume the nebula appeared to be taking
shape, and in the fourth the process has advanced a stage. E. M. may be issuing the
fourteenth before that shape can be accurately defined and described. The curve has
not been drawn far enough for us to say what course it will trace; but there is already
enough of it to look like a curve and not merely like a wavy line.</p>

<p>That remote first volume, which was of course a symptom and a rallying-point or
the new tendencies, not their origin, seems now to have been somewhat chaotic and
lacking in direction. It included such older poets as Mr. G. K. Chesterton, Mr. Sturge
Moore, and Sir Ronald Ross; and some of those who appear to-day the most characteristic
had not then shown themselves. At that time the most powerful tendency
seemed to be leading towards the realism, sometimes informed with a conscious brutality,
of Mr. Masefield, Mr. Gibson, and Mr. Abercrombie. In 1919 this sort is fully represented
only by Mr. Abercrombie's <i>Witchcraft: New Style</i>, a poem principally in dialogue
which is realistic in method, if its conception has a fairy-tale brutality about it. Such
lines as the following are in a familiar style:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A little brisk grey slattern of a woman,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pattering along in her loose-heel'd clogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Push't the brass-barr'd door of a public-house;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spring went hard against her; hand and knee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shoved their weak best. As the door poised ajar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hullabaloo of talking men burst out,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pouring babble of inflamed palaver.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">In spite of their vividness and exactitude, they make us think of a good passage of prose
slightly spoiled. Mr. Gibson has not continued in the vein, and is confined here to a few
momentary impressions, mostly in the sonnet form.</p>

<p>But if we dismiss this tendency from those we imply when we speak of "Georgian,"
poetry, if we admit too that Mr. W. H. Davies is often not characteristic but a poet who
might have appeared at almost any time (as, in another way, is Mr. John Drinkwater),
what are we to take for our definition? If we are ever to devise one, we must somehow
reconcile and bring under one heading a bundle of qualities, which seem to have but
little in common when they are separately described. Yet that there is some common
term, some central motive, is suggested by the fact that the pieces in this book which
may be thought to be on a lower level than the rest, those by Mr. Moult and Mrs.
Shove, are yet not wholly out of place. These writers have been touched in some degree
by the spirit of the time, which manifests itself with more power and originality in
poets so diverse as Mr. de la Mare, Mr. Sassoon, and Mr. Turner. But it is likely that
for some time we shall have to content ourselves with such vague recognitions of spirit,
without attempting to be more precise in definition.</p>

<p>We must at all events include Mr. Monro's curious and good poem, <i>Man Carrying
Bale</i>, which by its title gives a faint suggestion of some sorts of modern painting, and is
actuated by the same desire, to flash suddenly a light on a familiar thing from an
unfamiliar angle:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The tough hand closes gently on the load,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Out of the mind, a voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls "Lift!" and the arms, remembering well their work,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lengthen and pause for help.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then a slow ripple flows from head to foot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all the muscles call to one another:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Lift!" and the bulging bale<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Floats like a butterfly in June.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">With this may be associated Mr. Davies' remarkable piece, <i>A Child's Pet</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I sailed out of Baltimore<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With twice a thousand head of sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They would not eat, they would not drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But bleated o'er the deep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Inside the pens we crawled each day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To sort the living from the dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when we reached the Mersey's mouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had lost five hundred head.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet every night and day one sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That had no fear of man or sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stuck through the bars its pleading face,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And it was stroked by me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And to the sheep-man standing near,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"You see," I said, "this one tame sheep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems a child has lost her pet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And cried herself to sleep."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So every time we passed it by,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sailing to England's slaughter-house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eight ragged sheep-men&mdash;tramps and thieves&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would stroke that sheep's black nose.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">Yet of how different a quality is the whole admirable selection of eight poems from
Mr. de la Mare, to illustrate which we quote the exquisite <i>Fare Well</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I lie where shades of darkness<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall no more assail mine eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor the rain make lamentation<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When the wind sighs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How will fare the world whose wonder<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was the very proof of me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Memory fades, must the remembered<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Perishing be?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, when this my dust surrenders,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hand, foot, lip, to dust again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May those loved and loving faces<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Please other men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May the rusting harvest hedgerow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Still the Traveller's Joy entwine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as happy children gather<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Posies once mine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Look thy last on all things lovely,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Every hour. Let no night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seal thy sense in deathly slumber<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till to delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou have paid thy utmost blessing;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since that all things thou wouldst praise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty took from those who loved them<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In other days.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">We come again upon another manner in the poems of Mr. Robert Nichols. Here an
inadequate passage from a long and very lovely piece called <i>The Sprig of Lime</i> will serve
to suggest his qualities:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweet lime that often at the height of noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diffusing dizzy fragrance from your boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tasselled with blossoms more innumerable<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the black bees, the uproar of whose toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Filled your green vaults, winning such metheglyr.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As clouds their sappy cells, distil, as once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye used, your sunniest emanations<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Towards the window where a woman kneels&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She who within that room in childish hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay through the lasting murmur of blanch'd noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behind the sultry blind, now full, now flat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drinking anew of every odorous breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supremely happy in her ignorance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Time that hastens hourly and of death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who need not haste.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">These poems are not realism, but passages of reality imaginatively seized and transfigured
by passion; and the same description may be applied to a number of pieces in
this book as different from these as these are from one another. If we attempt to map out
the whole achievement and promise which the book represents, we must refer to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
originality and beauty of rhythm displayed by Mr. John Freeman in such a poem as
<i>The Alde</i>, which begins:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How near I walked to Love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How long, I cannot tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was like the Alde that flows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quietly through green level lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So quietly, it knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their shape, their greenness, and their shadows well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then undreamingly for miles it goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silently, beside the sea.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">We must refer also to Mr. W. J. Turner's noble and largely conceived, if a little chaotic,
poem <i>Death</i>; and to Mr. Sassoon's extraordinarily economical and finished pictures of
impressions at the front and in England. There is moreover Mr. Brett Young's graceful
and delicate talent.</p>

<p>If we say that in all these it is possible to perceive reality imaginatively seized and
transfigured by passion, even if we add a general curiosity to penetrate behind the
appearances of things to their substance, we say no more than we ought to say of any
poetry which we are disposed to praise. Perhaps if we could say much more we should
distinguish the literature with which we are dealing as one which has forsaken the proper
traditions of the art for qualities of a merely temporary interest. It is not necessarily the
business of new poets to discover new objects for poetry; it is their business to bring to
bear on the old objects their own new personalities and whatever has accrued both to the
language and to general human experience. We are of opinion that the "Georgian"
poets are doing this; and though to give them that title still requires something of an act
of faith, it is one much easier to make than it was seven years ago.</p>

<p>The survival of the word as the name of a period is, of course, not yet assured. Many
of these writers are still extremely young. Some of them will develop in ways which
cannot yet be foreseen. Mr. Nichols and Mr. Turner, both of them capable of grandiose
conceptions and engaged in making a style to sustain them, will very likely attempt the
drama, where an empty throne is waiting. Mr. de la Mare, who is probably the oldest of
the distinctively Georgian writers, grows every year deeper and solider, and it is
impossible to say what will become of him. Mr. Robert Graves is producing a body of
work almost every line of which is as sweet and sound as a nut, and is an influence
against the obscurity from which a good many of his contemporaries suffer. The author
of <i>A Ballad of Nursery Rhyme</i>, which begins:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Strawberries that in gardens grow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are plump and juicy fine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sweeter far as wise men know<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spring from the woodland vine.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">No need for bowl or silver spoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sugar or spice or cream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has the wild berry plucked in June,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beside the trickling stream,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">may perhaps have done a service by writing these lines at the same time as Mr. Turner
was writing such a fine but involved stanza as this from <i>Death</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That sound rings down the years&mdash;I hear it yet&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All earthly life's a winding funeral&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And though I never wept,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But into the dark coach stept,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dreaming by night to answer the blood's sweet call,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She who stood there, high-breasted, with small, wise lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave me wine to drink and bread to eat,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Has not more steadfast feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fades from my arms as fade from mariners' eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sea's most beauteous ships.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">And others no doubt will appear who are now no more thought of than were Mr.
Nichols or Mr. Graves or Mr. Turner in 1912.</p>

<p>At least this movement&mdash;we do not use the word in the sense of "organised movement"
or "school"&mdash;has had the luck of early recognition and careful fostering.
There are faults to be found with this as with the three earlier volumes of the series,
but, in a world which has produced no faultless anthology, we ought not to expect
the first to be a collection of contemporary verse. No one will be able to look through
the book without objections rising to his lips. Every reader will want this or that poet
omitted, this or that included. There are few readers of anthologies who do not find,
on mature consideration, that they could have done the work better themselves, and this
would be just if, in fact, anthologists worked only for themselves. But to E. M. we must
assign the credit of having carried through an exceedingly difficult task with as few
mistakes as could be thought possible. He has the extra distinction of having foreseen
seven years ago the beginning of a "liveliness" which has justified him by enduring
until at this moment it shows no signs of recession. He would be no doubt the last
person to claim the invention, or even the discovery, of the "Georgian" movement.
But he might reasonably claim, and, if he does not, the honour must be thrust upon
him, to have provided it with a means of growing naturally and without undue
extravagance.</p>

<h4 class="left">NEW POEMS. By <span class="smcap">Iolo Aneurin Williams</span>. Methuen. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Williams' first book of poems, published four years ago, was a quite little book,
noticeable for some polished little songs with a Caroline or Queen Anne air. His tastes
have remained the same; his capacity for writing has developed; he paints miniatures,
and his ingenuity expends itself on the elaboration and variation of the frames. The
frontier between success and non-success is narrow in this kind of work; a slight flaw
ruins all, and Mr. Williams does not always escape collapse. But <i>Alice</i> and <i>Song</i> are
of a neatness and completeness which would do credit to the best of the Queen Anne
practitioners. <i>The Country Songs</i> is a fragment of what may become a really excellent
celebration of our folk-songs, and <i>Rocks</i> and <i>Astronomy</i>, though still with something
of the song in them, let delicate plummets into deeper waters. The image of the
rock, doomed to decay, yet</p>

<span class="i0">An ever fresh prefigurement<br /></span>

<p class="in0">It is an unambitious and uneven but very pleasant little book.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE WAR POEMS OF SIEGFRIED SASSOON. Heinemann. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This volume contains fifty-two poems selected from Mr. Sassoon's previous volumes,
and twelve new ones. The former are far too well known to need description at this
date; but we think that even in these, and still more in the new poems, there is ground
for the conjecture that those who think of Mr. Sassoon primarily as a savage realist and
satirist are likely in the future to be surprised. It was a genuine and profound sensibility,
tenderness, and a cheated passion for beauty that produced his war poetry; not an
innate predilection for violence, vituperation, or caricature. Now the storm has gone
over he seems to be becoming more and more a poet of nature. The transition is perhaps
symbolised in the most beautiful of the new poems here printed. It is called <i>Everyone
Sang</i>, and concludes the book, so full of blood and corpses, rats, evil smells, and all
the turmoil and <i>débris</i> of war:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Everyone suddenly burst out singing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was filled with such delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As prisoned birds must find in freedom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Winging wildly across the white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orchards and dark green fields; on; on; and out of sight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Everyone's voice was suddenly lifted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beauty came like the setting sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart was shaken with tears and horror<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drifted away.... O but every one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a bird; and the song was wordless; the singing will never be done.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The book contains much that, however sincere, can only be described as journalism
<i>in excelsis</i>, but it is all inextricably mixed with genuine poetry, and the collection as a
whole, we suspect, will have a permanent interest and value. Better than from a hundred
histories posterity will get from these poems a picture of how men felt and looked in
that world of</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sad, smoking, flat horizons, reeking woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And foundered trench-lines volleying doom for doom.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Their merits are never more clearly displayed than when they are compared to the
poems of the imitators who have sprung up like mushrooms since Mr. Sassoon began
publishing. These have taken his brutal words, his more obvious attitudes, and the
senile and complacent objects of his satire; but in the copies the life is lacking.</p>

<h4 class="left">ARGONAUT AND JUGGERNAUT. By <span class="smcap">Osbert Sitwell</span>. Chatto &amp; Windus
5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>At first sight this book looks like a revolutionary manifesto. Its title is vehement and
original, and its paper "jacket" is decorated with the photograph of a negro head
surmounted with a towering and tapering wickerwork structure. It has no bearing on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
the contents, and we can only assume that the author put it there because he liked it or
to arrest attention. Attention having been arrested, expectation is disappointed. It is
true that Mr. Sitwell often writes in <i>vers libres</i>, and that he opens with a challenge and
hearty proclamation in the key of</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let us prune the tree of language<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of its dead fruit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us melt up the clichés<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into molten metal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fashion weapons that will scald and flay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us curb this eternal humour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And become witty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us dig up the dragon's teeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this fertile soil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before they fructify.<br /></span>

<p class="in0">And that, at a later stage, he observes that</p>

<span class="i0">The world itself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dances<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make us dance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cosmic frenzy.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">But his frenzies have a very calculated air; he has not got rid of those clichés, and that
wit does not emerge. He cannot really play the revolutionary with gusto, so, as Queen
Victoria said, "We are not amused": and when he lapses into more ordinary forms
and more connected statements he is revealed as an ordinary immature writer of verses.
He has some gift of observation which he will waste unless he treats it more conscientiously,
but observation will not make a poet.</p>

net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Fairfax's volume consists of "Verse translations from the French, Spanish, Italian,
German, Greek, Latin, with a few Arabic, Japanese, and Armenian renderings from
French prose versions." Mezzofanti and the monk Calepino, in another sphere, must
be alarmed for their linguistic laurels. Some of Mr. Fairfax's translations are neat;
but we hope those from the Armenian&mdash;our Armenian wants rubbing up&mdash;are nearer
the spirit of the originals than are some of those from European languages. He is at his
neatest in some brief poems from the Spanish. His versions of Hérédia and Baudelaire
are especially lifeless; and he inflicts an additional injury upon the latter by attributing
the famous <i>Don Juan in Hell</i> to Hérédia.</p>

<p class="inp">It seems probable that a long time must elapse before the novel escapes altogether
from the spell of the war; and the reasons why this should be so are fairly obvious. It
is not only that the novelists, like all of us, have received in their minds an indelible
impress of that great event. We must recognise that the last five years have made a gulf
between us and preceding time only comparable to a long interval of history. The
manners and habits of 1913 are not connected in an imperceptibly changing fabric
with our own. They are already a matter of archæological interest, and definitely to
place the action of a novel in that year requires a course of archæological research&mdash;say
among old numbers of <i>Punch</i>. In 1919 the war is still so vivid a thread in the web of our
minds that we are constantly influenced by it, constantly referring to it, in our actions,
our conversations, and our thoughts. When we meet a character, whether in a novel or
a drawing-room, it is still our instinct to enquire where he has been, what he has been
doing since August, 1914, and the present moment. This is natural indeed; but its
tendency in the novel is to produce ephemeral work. The tidal wave may have subsided,
but it has left the mental waters exceedingly muddy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Humphry Ward's novel, <i>Cousin Philip</i>, is an excellent example of the work
which this state of affairs elicits from even the most serious authors. It is a study,
careful and detailed, of the sort of young woman who has emerged from the war. Helena
Pitstone, aged nineteen, arrives at the house of her guardian, Lord Buntingford. She
looks like Romney's Lady Hamilton; but "the beautiful head was set off by a khaki
close cap, carrying a badge, and the khaki uniform, tunic, short skirt, and leggings,
might have been specially designed to show the health and symmetry of the girl's young
form"&mdash;all this though she has been demobilised. She naturally begins her stay with
Lord Buntingford by quarrelling with him over one of her men friends, whom he
refuses to allow her to invite to his house. This gentleman had run away with the wife
of a friend, not for any base motive&mdash;"He didn't mean anything horrid," says Helena&mdash;but
"for a lark," and to show her husband that she was not to be bullied. In the end
Helena marries a politician, who says to her, "Are you mine&mdash;are you mine at last?&mdash;you
wild thing!"&mdash;a remark which has been made by other lovers in other novels. In
between these two points lies Mrs. Humphry Ward's study of the girl of the period, in
order to make which, it may be supposed, she wrote this novel. An idea of its quality
and usefulness may be gained from the following specimen of Helena's conversation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"The chauffeur here is a fractious idiot. He has done that Rolls-Royce car of Cousin
Philip's balmy, and cut up quite rough when I spoke to him about it."</p>

<p>"Done it what?" said Mrs. Friend faintly.</p>

<p>"Balmy. Don't you know that expression?" Helena, on the floor, with her hands
under her knees, watched her companion's looks with a grin. "It's <i>our</i> language now, you
know&mdash;English&mdash;the language of us young people. The old ones have got to learn it as we
speak it."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">Mrs. Ward would no doubt be shocked by a writer who delivered his, or her, views on
the French people with an obvious ignorance of the French language. She would despise
the affectation of an author who used Latin tags incorrectly. But it is only fair to say
that her views on the younger generation are rendered slightly ridiculous by her
obvious ignorance of its idioms. She would perhaps have been better employed in a
detailed picture of the manners of 1913, a period to which she doubtless looks back as
to a lost paradise of decorous behaviour.</p>

<p>Mr. Galsworthy's <i>Saint's Progress</i> suffers less from insufficient documentation.
His heroine Noel, with her short hair, is the daughter of a clergyman, and follows the
course gloomily foretold for so many young girls during the war-period to the predestined
end of bearing a war-baby. She and her sister Gratian are forced by the pressure
of events to think and act for themselves. Gratian, safely married to a doctor, delivers
herself as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dad," said Gratian suddenly, "we can only find out for ourselves, even if we do singe
our wings in doing it. We've been reading James's <i>Pragmatism</i>. George says the only chapter
that's important is missing&mdash;the one on ethics, to show that what we do is not wrong till
it's proved wrong by the result. I suppose he was afraid to deliver that lecture."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">But, while Mr. Galsworthy is much superior to Mrs. Ward in the accuracy of his
information, he can hardly be said to be superior to her in the justice and clearness of
his presentation. The traits of his persons are correctly observed and generalised, but
they are not shown through the medium of living individuals. We feel of Noel that
many girls of such a disposition found themselves in such circumstances and behaved
thus; and so far, regarded as a sociological study, the book is deserving of praise. But
what we never feel is that the individual girl, Noel, ever existed; and by the deficiency
it is condemned as a novel. This book will be a serious disappointment to those
who imagined from <i>Five Tales</i> that Mr. Galsworthy had recovered the original
freshness of his talent and was about to begin a new and a sincerer period.</p>

<p>But perhaps the desire to depict, and to comment on, phenomena so fresh and living
in the mind as these, which has been fatal to experienced craftsmen of the order of
Mrs. Ward and Mr. Galsworthy, is one which will ruin any novel in which it is attempted.
Miss Romer Wilson has not the experience of either; but as her first book, <i>Martin Schuler</i>,
demonstrated, she has really extraordinary natural gifts. These gifts are still obvious
in her second book, which is nevertheless disappointing and all but a complete failure.
It describes a circle of non-combatants during the last year of the war, young people,
of whom Mrs. Ward has hardly heard, who sway between cynical disgust with the world
around them and cynical disgust with their own natures. No man, it has been wisely
said, is uninteresting, and these persons, regarded from a sane and tolerantly humorous
point of view, might have been the theme for a good book. But since the thoughts, or
actions, the manners through which they manifest themselves not being genuine or
spontaneous, are important neither for good nor evil, the method of treating them
seriously results in making them appear thin and tedious. Affectations, except in the
rare event of their producing serious consequences, are a topic only for satire; and here
the loves of Josephine and Sebastian, of James Blanchard and Susan and Amaryllis, are
expressed purely by affectations, which overlie and conceal whatever genuine feelings
these persons may have possessed. This type has had in recent years a curious attraction
for young novelists, who have as a result produced many books which are not worthy of
attention. But the author of <i>Martin Schuler</i> must sin deeply before we can refuse to
read any book of hers, however unwillingly we may persevere in it. And even here her
special qualities are altogether beyond mistake. She can still, even in this dreary and
pointless tale of people we should prefer not to meet, astonish us with vivid and enchanting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
fragments of pictorial beauty. A couple of these passages, which are all that redeems
the book from dullness, may be given as specimens:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>... At the turn of the night it began to rain, and at daybreak the whole country
was grey with driving rain, which spluttered against the bedroom window and beat upon
the thatch. The noisy sparrows under the eaves shook themselves angrily and fluttered up
and down in the garden after worms. The tom cat, who had been out all night, gathered
himself up on the doorstep and brooded there with one eye on the sparrows, waiting for
the door to be opened. The draught under the door made his paws cold, so he blew himself
out and crouched down with his paws folded up underneath him. He was angry and tired,
and his fur was covered with minute drops of water that in places had penetrated to his
skin, but he sat there patiently dosing and dreaming for two hours until half-past eight,
when the bolts were drawn. At the sound of the bolts being shot back he at once stood up
and mewed, and the door was hardly opened before he ran into the kitchen, where a stick
fire roared in the grate and a frying-pan gave out an odour of frying fat.</p>

<p>... The people came out of the house door, mysterious in the fading light like a
procession of Boccaccio's women and a clerk of the Decameron seen through the romantic
distance of seven hundred years. They lit the candles in the dark garden-room and sat down
as if waiting for somebody to begin a story. Overhead the blue sky gleamed through the
gathering darkness, and in the west a rosy glow spread up behind the delicate aspens and
maples and acacias of the little plantation above the yew garden. Up in the mazy blue sky
the transparent half moon and a few bright planets gleamed beneath the outermost heavens,
where faint white constellations began to appear as the darkness quickly gathered upon
the earth.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">We do not quote these descriptive passages as proving Miss Wilson's aptitude for the
novelist's multifarious task. They represent only one of the many gifts of which she
must dispose; and they are themselves in several details open to criticism. They do
moreover represent almost everything in this book which can be distinguished for
commendation. They suggest, however, that Miss Wilson possesses one of the most
important gifts of the novelists, namely, a sense of the scene; and it remains for time to
show whether she can imagine persons and a situation worthy of her background.</p>

<p>It is a relief to recede from the tangled epoch, which has spoilt and hindered all these
writers, into the seventeenth century in France. Miss Mirrlees has written, not a wholly
satisfactory or very agreeable, but a very strange book, one far removed from the
historical romance of commerce. She has combined what appears to be a close knowledge
of her period, of the time of the Jansenists, the Précieuses, and Mademoiselle de
Scudéry, with a desire to study a curious case of mental pathology. Madeleine, her
heroine, is a provincial girl who removes to Paris with her family and is consumed by
an intense longing to enter that fantastic circle of elegance and <i>galanterie</i> which revolved
round Mademoiselle de Scudéry and was depicted by her in <i>Le Grand Cyrus</i>. But her
awkward shyness forbade that this longing should ever be satisfied; and when she
sought to pacify it by the familiar device of the "endless story," she exacerbated it into
madness. This is a brief and inadequate account of a most unusual composition, but it
will serve to show how Miss Mirrlees has loaded the historical novel with a heavier
freight than that ornamental craft is accustomed to carry. But she has not developed
either the psychology or the descriptive detail at the expense of the other. She dissects
Madeleine's mind with almost morbid closeness and makes of it a terrifying spectacle,
but at the same time she has contrived to make her setting in time and place convincing.
Her picture of mind and manners may or may not be strictly accurate; but it is certainly
not conventional, it is original, it <i>bites</i>. There are certain crudities apparent
both in the style and in the construction of the book, as well as in the choice and
development of subject; but it will be very interesting to see the next production of a
mind so unusual.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
Miss Clemence Dane's <i>Legend</i> touches Miss Mirrlees' work fleetingly at one point.
It too describes a literary "circle," dominated by women, of the sort which draws
weaker characters into it and causes them to deteriorate. But it interests not so much as
a study of this particular phenomenon as in that it is an extraordinary attempt, the only
one among these books, to carry on the history of the novel, to give that form a new
task, to enlarge its range and its adaptabilities. It consists of one long conversation; and
the principal character, Madala Grey, makes no appearance, unless the regrettable
introduction of her ghost towards the end be counted as such. Madala is a
woman-novelist who has contracted what seems to her friends an inexplicable marriage
with a dull country doctor. She is in child-bed; and her circle meets to await news,
hears of her death, and discusses her. Their views, all mistaken, are reported by the
one person present who had never seen her and who deduces the true and simple
explanation&mdash;that she was actually in love with her husband. This is, it may be objected,
merely jumping through a series of hoops; and in a sense the objection has its justification.
For, when the story should reach its climax, when Madala herself begins to emerge
from the mists of misjudgment and misinterpretation, she is revealed as being only a
lay figure. This does not mean that Miss Dane's singular device in the end misses its
aim. On the contrary she accomplishes what she set out to do with perfect precision.
Nevertheless, the fact remains that she has locked in a very complicated cabinet, and
thence extracted again by very subtle means, not a living woman but a doll. Hence her
book is not the masterpiece it might have been. But we are almost brought to overlook
this fact by the amazing skill with which she manages her invention; and her jumping
through hoops, whether it be regarded as an unrelated exhibition of agility or as an
experiment in a new method of progress, deserves all attention even though it leads
only to disappointment at the end. Miss Dane's first novel, <i>Regiment of Women</i>, was much
praised not long ago; her second, <i>First the Blade</i>, did not receive so much notice.
This reveals in her originality, daring and ingenuity which could hardly have been
predicted from her earlier work; and there is no doubt that it will be widely discussed,
since it is in fact rare for any really remarkable display of these qualities to miss its
reward. But Miss Dane has yet some distance to advance if she is to do more than win
fame as a conjuror or open up paths for other novelists. For an artist capable of so
distinguished a conception her style is strangely flat and undistinguished; and the
introduction of some very bad and banal passages from the works of Madala Grey is a
curious lapse of tact.</p>

<p>Mr. John Cournos's <i>The Mask</i>, which is perhaps the most satisfactory of all these
books, though it is not so dazzling and exciting as <i>Legend</i>, is one which has very little to
say to the development of the novel. We generally reckon it impertinent to see in any
book not avowed as such the autobiography of the author; but in this story of a Jewish
boy in Russia and America, without knowing anything of Mr. Cournos, we are forced
to make the inference. Its tone and flavour are those of autobiography; and its softened
reminiscences of things not always pleasant give it its peculiar charm. It reveals, at all
events, more than most novels, a temperament; and this temperament, whatever turn
the story may take, is always agreeable and gracious. Vanya Gombarov, the little boy,
was brought up in Russia by a stepfather, who wasted all his money in mechanical
researches and was obliged to emigrate with his family to America. Here Vanya added
to the family income by selling papers, and in other ways, and saw many horrible things.
The family experienced many misfortunes; and at the end Mr. Cournos abruptly
leaves it moving from one house to another. We have here no pyrotechnics of construction;
nor does such a book offer any opportunities for them to the author.
But he is able to show himself an artist in the softening veil which his narrative throws
over his incidents without in any way distorting them.</p>

<h3>BELLES-LETTRES AND CRITICISM</h3>

<h4 class="left">SEVEN MEN. By <span class="smcap">Max Beerbohm.</span> Heinemann. 7<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It is a common ground of complaint against Mr. Max Beerbohm that he publishes too
little. But the very fastidiousness which makes him, compared with the word-fountains
of our time, so notable an example of limitation of output is what makes the work he
does print so surpassingly good. Economy is a word freely used and much abused.
It is sometimes applied to writers whose only claim to it is that they use short sentences
or that they omit everything except inessentials. But Mr. Beerbohm deserves more than
any artist of our time the epithet "economical." Always, and increasingly so with the
passage of time, he has taken pains to print no sentence and no word that does not help
his effect; and the five stories in this book, even were their other merits less than they
are, might serve as models of simple and exact expression, the cunning accumulation of
telling detail, the complete avoidance of detail which does not tell.</p>

<p>Of the five stories one, <i>James Pethel</i>, is a study of the gambling temperament localised
in an attractive but terrifying man, and one, <i>A. V. Laider</i>, is an astonishingly clever
fantasia on the theme of lying. The other, and more ambitious, three are studies, we
might almost call them historical studies, of literature, literary men, and "the literary
life." They all relate to that remote period, now faded and therefore a little charming,
"the nineties"; they give us types of writers, second or third or tenth rate, whose
reputations die, but who are interesting enough to be celebrated as types, if not as
individuals. Savonarola Brown&mdash;the obscure man who spent his life on an unfinished
tragedy on the best blank-verse models&mdash;is the most slightly sketched of them; but here
what the portrait lacks&mdash;perhaps that shadowy figure offered no more lines for the
pencil to seize&mdash;is more than made up for by the best parody that even Mr. Beerbohm
has written. Remove the burlesque, the comic stage directions, the juxtapositions of
Lucrezia Borgia, St. Francis, Andrea del Sarto and Pippa (who "passes" in her own
inimitable way), and the more extravagant convolutions of the plot, and you will see
that Mr. Beerbohm could quite easily have manufactured a play better than most
modern poetic dramas, and written in verse at once so fluent and so reminiscent of
the best masters as to command the respect of the reviewers, and possibly a production
(for a few nights) by some manager ambitious to show that he desired to reunite Literature
and the Stage. At times we forget that we are reading a burlesque:</p>

<p class="in0">Did Mr. Beerbohm write this? Or was it Brown, fresh from <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> or
<i>The Broken Heart</i>?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
The two stories that remain are more elaborate. In <i>Enoch Soames</i> we are given the
picture of the kind of sepulchral, costive, dedicated, fame-gluttonous minor poet who
has haunted the by-ways of literature in all ages; we are given, as well, a realistic picture
of what those by-ways were twenty years ago, and a plot (which races between the
future and the past) the intricacies of which are followed with equal ingenuity and
imperturbability. But there can be little dispute that <i>Maltby and Braxton</i> is the great
achievement of the volume. These two were rivals who had a brief vogue in the nineties;
the very scent of the time comes back with the titles of their masterpieces, <i>Ariel in
Mayfair</i> and <i>A Faun in the Cotswolds</i>. Maltby in a weak moment cheated Braxton out
of a week-end at the Duchess of Hertfordshire's, and when the hapless Maltby got to
Keeb Hall Braxton's ghost haunted him, driving him into perpetual solecisms and
misadventures. There is the background: the gossiping coteries of London, the fleeting
fashions of literature, the first vogue of the bicycle, the dabbling great dames, the house-parties,
soirées, dinners, church-goings. And in front of it the most comic of tragedies,
the most tragic of comedies is played. The story is written with such skill that the
cruelty is never quite cruel, the laughter never quite flippant, the extravagances always
anchored to reality: at the end, in spite not only of the caricature but of the "tallest"
fiction about a ghost that we remember, we feel that we have been reading a plain statement
of fact. And this is what, at bottom, the story is: it is more realistic than any
naturalist novel: it is the work of one who, for all his fantastic invention and wit, has
a prodigiously keen pair of eyes and a profound understanding of human nature. We
hope, by the way, that Mr. Beerbohm's passage about literary fauns will finally expel
these overworked creatures from our midst.</p>

<h4 class="left">DONNE'S SERMONS: SELECTED PASSAGES WITH AN ESSAY. By <span class="smcap">Logan
Pearsall Smith</span>. Milford. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Donne's reputation as a poet, very high for some time after his death, sank almost to
nothingness for two centuries. In the last thirty years he has, by virtue partly of his
occasional splendours of passion, imagery, and even music, partly of a modernity in him
which is attuned to the spirit of our own time, regained his old position. Much has been
written of him; Mr. Gosse has written his <i>Life</i> in two volumes, Professor Grierson has
edited him in one of the most exhaustive and scholarly of the Oxford editions of poets;
he has exercised a traceable influence on men now writing. But the revival has been
confined to his poems. His prose, contained in three huge folios and several small
pamphlets, has remained unread; and it is significant that until a few years ago he who
wished to possess (for none thought of perusing) the Dean's sermons was likelier to
find them at a theological bookseller's than in one of those shops which cater for the
collector of fine literature. The neglect was doubly explicable. Not only were Donne's
Sermons sermons, and therefore liable to fall into the disregard into which the sermons
of South and Tillotson, and even those of Jeremy Taylor, have fallen, but they were
sermons so voluminous as to be terrifying to the most insatiable reader, and (for the
most part) so involved, so stuffed with scholasticism, theological hair-splitting, debate
about texts and about commentaries on texts, that a first attempt at perusal might have
made the bravest quail. But the few who have dared the darkness of the great mine have
never been disappointed; all over it, sparkling magnificently to the explorer's touch, are
great jewels of imagination cut with the craft of a master of language.</p>

<p>Mr. Pearsall Smith, performing for his readers the labour they would have shirked,
has gone through the whole of Donne's Sermons and extracted a hundred-and-fifty
passages, short and long, illustrating his character and his genius. Not quite the whole
of the ground is covered; the editor has chosen nothing of which the principal claim to
distinction was that it conveyed, with great justice or great force, a doctrine of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
Church or an edifying lesson. He has made his anthology as a poet and a student of
character would make it; and the result is a volume of passages which exhibit that
strange vehement man of genius more clearly than could any biography, and which
substantiates his claim to be considered as being, at his best, a writer of English prose
that has never been surpassed for music and richness. His greatest passages&mdash;and
this holds good of all English prose&mdash;are those in which he is contemplating large
elemental things. A roll like the roll of the prophetic books comes into his voice when he
speaks of the majesty of God, the powers of Death and of Evil, the passage of time, the
justice that waits for sin, and the decay that will overtake beauty; when he stands in
the attitudes and assumes the voice of adoration, of accusation, or of grief. But even
in his dialectics the restless intellectual in him was continually striking out sparks of wit;
the insatiable observer in him was noting small things, sticks, straws, and insects,
puddles and ponds; the insuppressible poet pouring out images copious enough to
furnish out a hundred minor men. This is a long-needed book, done with competence
and exquisite taste. His greatest, loveliest things are as good as Sir Thomas Browne's;
his grandest are grander than Jeremy Taylor's. There is probably no sentence in our
language so long as that in which he depicted Eternal Damnation, yet it swells and
swells, never breaking its back, always borne up by the mighty mind of his spirit. Hell
is deprivation of God. "That God," begins this great passage,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">that God should let my soule fall out of his hand, into a bottomlesse pit, and roll an
unremoveable stone upon it, and leave it to that which it finds there (and it shall finde that
there, which it never imagined, till it came thither) and never think more of that soule,
never have more to doe with it. That of that providence of God, that studies the life of
every weed, and worme, and ant, and spider, and toad, and viper, there should never, never
any beame flow out upon me; that that God, who looked upon me, when I was nothing,
and called me when I was not, as though I had been, out of the womb and depth of darknesse,
will not looke upon me now, when, though a miserable, and a banished, and a damned
creature, yet I am his creature still, and contribute something to his story, even in my
damnation....</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">so it proceeds in tremendous crescendo describing, or failing to describe, what it must
mean "to fall out of the hands of the living God ... a horror beyond our expression,
beyond our imagination"; and this is but the sublimest of many sublime utterances
in these sermons of the greatest of the Church's poets. We commend Mr. Pearsall
Smith's book, and shall return to it and its subject at length in an early number.</p>

<h4 class="left">SOUTH SEA FOAM. By <span class="smcap">A. Safroni-Middleton</span>. Methuen. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The sub-title of this book, "The Romantic Adventures of a Modern Don Quixote in
the Southern Seas," gives the clue to a quality in Mr. Safroni-Middleton that
might repel a fastidious reader. He is a little too effusive, a little too self-conscious
in his adventurousness. But the reader who is repelled early will miss something;
for with all its defects <i>South Sea Foam</i> is a full and exciting and often beautiful
book. Mr. Middleton has not the technique of the artist; he does not write
well. But he has the artist's sensibility, and his writing is at its most vivid when the
greatest demands are made upon it. "My greatest literary effort in the following
pages," he says, "has been to keep to the truth of the whole matter, even
though such frankness should leave me, at the end of this volume, with a blackened
name." He need not be anxious about his name; but if this book is all true
he has had adventures as wild and strange as any man alive. His book is a medley
of Polynesian legends, and the most extraordinary events on the ocean and among the
islands; storms, moonlight dances, abductions of "dusky maidens" from chiefs'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
palaces, orgies in saloons, chases and shots, canoes, sharks, and love-songs: a great flood
of brightly-coloured reminiscence tumbled out in language which is never quite "right"
but always picturesque. At any page one is liable to come across some passage that
thrills or deeply touches; and occasionally there is an episode narrated so well that
criticism is silent. Such an episode is that of the old dog Moses, which falls overboard
on a murky night. He barks amid the waves to guide the boat; but there comes a scream
that means a shark and no more is heard. Next night the old bearded sailor-men sit on
their chests in the fo'c'sle puffing out smoke, drinking rum in silence, brooding over
the dog: and no scene could be more vividly painted. The last adventure (in a castaway
boat with a brown girl), which we should call incredible were it not for Mr. Middleton's
assurance, is the loveliest and most terrible of all. We think that anyone who reads this
book once will make a habit of reading it.</p>

<h4 class="left">RUPERT BROOKE AND THE INTELLECTUAL IMAGINATION: A
LECTURE. By <span class="smcap">Walter de la Mare</span>. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson. 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The lecture here printed was delivered before Rugby School on the occasion of the
unveiling of a memorial there to Rupert Brooke. Mr. de la Mare, as he recalls, was chosen
to go to America as Mrs. Brooke's representative to receive the first presentation of the
Howland Memorial Prize, the posthumous award of which to Brooke was an act of
international courtesy and generosity, too little noticed in this country at the time. It
was fitting that Mr. de la Mare should be again associated with the dead poet; and in
this short paper he outlines his character and his achievement with as much affection
as discernment. Brooke, he is insistent to make plain, was a happy man, a vigorous,
healthy creature, who found the world teeming with food for his multifarious appetites.
It is with this fact in mind that all his poems, not omitting those which are "disquieting
to read at meals," must be judged. He desired truth at all costs; and "if, unlike
Methuselah, he did not live long enough to see life whole, he at least confronted it with
a remarkably steady and disconcerting stare." "The theme of his poetry," says Mr.
de la Mare, "is the life of the mind, the senses, the feelings, life here and now, however
impatient he may be with life's limitations. Its longing is for a state of consciousness
wherein this kind of life shall be possible without exhaustion, disillusionment, or
reaction." This essay is short, but it is full both of wise judgments and beautiful sayings.
It conveys a sense not only of the value of Brooke's poetry but also of the charm of his
personality. More, much more, will be written about him; and we shall have his
character carefully examined and defined, both by those who knew him and those who
did not. But this brief study, at once an exposition and a ceremonial and moving eulogy,
will retain its place in the literature collecting around his name.</p>

<h4 class="left">SOME SOLDIER POETS. By <span class="smcap">T. Sturge Moore</span>. Grant Richards. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This volume contains short essays on the poems of Julian Grenfell, Rupert Brooke,
Robert Nichols, Robert Graves, Siegfried Sassoon, R. E. Vernède, Charles Sorley,
Francis Ledwidge, Edward Thomas, F. W. Harvey, Richard Aldington, and Alan
Seeger: with a paper on "The Best Poetry" at the end. A casual student of the list of
contents might make several hasty criticisms. He might suppose that he was going to
find here a series of short lives, manufactured because of an accidental connection
between them. He might be fortified in this suspicion by the fact that one or two poets
are in the list who have no claim to rank with the others. But he need only begin to read
the book to remember that Mr. Sturge Moore is a poet, a sound critic, and a writer
incapable of hackwork. There is one obvious defect; he has omitted a few poets (Edward
Wyndham Tennant is an example) who had better claim to admission than some in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
list. But there is little else that can be urged against him. Mr. Sturge Moore wastes no
space over biography. He takes, <i>seriatim</i>, the books of these young poets and confronts
them in a generous but not an undiscriminating mood, asking himself what is their
spirit, what their technical qualities and defects and which are their best poems. These
essays are not (even when their subjects are unworthy of effort) facile journalism; they
are considered criticism written in the prose of a poet, prose rich with novel and beautiful
images and embodying the results of profound reflection upon life and art.</p>

<p>Mr. Sturge Moore's essay on Brooke is too brief to be a final estimate; the main fault
of all his essays is that they are not long enough to include sufficient quotations; otherwise
they would certainly be of permanent value. But it is a penetrating essay, full of
interesting <i>obiter dicta</i>, such as the statement that "the fallacy of impressionism" has
tainted modern æsthetic thought, and the more disputable statement that "failure in
love and war is much more inspiring to the poet than success; when the real world has
rejected a man he feels freer in the Muses' house; he no longer has any interests that
conflict with theirs." Julian Grenfell's <i>Into Battle</i> he describes (and we think he is right)
as the best poem of the war. Of three poets commonly linked together, he says that
"Those who shall gaze back a century hence may discern rather in Nichols than in
Sassoon or Graves the poet's mind that is independent of time and approaches all
human circumstance with the kinsman's joy and pain," though he admits that the race
has only just begun, and another runner may outstrip the others. He is admirable on
Sorley, whom many think the greatest loss to literature of all who fell in the war, and
he has found&mdash;and no one before has, we believe, so celebrated this poem&mdash;in Mr.
Harvey's <i>The Bugler</i> something like an isolated great poem. The one chapter
which we find relatively inadequate is that which deals with Edward Thomas.
"Every time I read them I like them better," he says; and he quotes in full Thomas's
superb welcome to death; but the reader misses here all the rest of the poet's most
beautiful poems and passages. They are even yet not known as they should be; we wait
for a collected volume to reveal to most English readers how profuse, in his last two
years, Thomas was of exquisite poems crowded with characteristic English landscape,
and often profoundly moving by their sincere expression of universal emotions. He
died resigned, and fulfilled at last. In Mr. Moore's words, "Our house was not well
ordered; he should not have had to write hastily for his own and his children's bread;
we have lost the chance of using him to the best advantage; yet he leaves us more than
we deserved, something that will be treasured by posterity for ever. As his body fell,
its cloak melted off the soul and we caught a glimpse which confounded our poor
recollections of the man, and words of his still tolling round our ears make us aware
that for him this dark casualty had a different meaning."</p>

<p>This work is really a Stevenson Encyclopædia reminiscent of that colossal Browning
Cyclopædia which still goes into new editions. Mr. Brown arranges, in alphabetical order,
the names of Stevenson's books, characters, friends, critics, dwelling-places, etc. We
have tested him with several questions and not found him to fail. He gives more than
the facts he might be expected to give; for example, when a book is under notice he
enters the latest prices paid for its first edition in the sale-room. He also lightens his
pages with compact but pungent comments. For instance, he describes Mr. Swinnerton's
able but hostile study of Stevenson as "the kind of study which it can be imagined
Dr. Clifford would write of Ignatius Loyola." A good book of its kind and one that
should be bought by everyone who has a Collected Stevenson. The illustrations do not
greatly add to its charms.</p>

<h3>HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<h4 class="left">FIFTY YEARS OF EUROPE, 1870&ndash;1919. By <span class="smcap">C. D. Hazen</span>. Bell. 14<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Professor Hazen ends his survey of the last fifty years of European history with the
words: "The evil that men do lives after them." The remark is not original, but it is
none the less historically true and melancholy. Upon page 414 of this book it refers to
Wilhelm Hohenzollern, but as the final note struck in a text-book of European history
it has a wider significance. After reading Professor Hazen one is tempted to ponder the
question whether the good men do is interred with the bones of history, and only the
evil done by them lives after them and their time. Here is the story of fifty years in
414 pages, and indisputably the story is concerned far more with the evil that men have
done than with the good. What is the reason of this? The question is extraordinarily
difficult to answer, and, though the reviewer <i>ex cathedra</i> is officially supposed not to
admit anything but infallibility, we confess to be at a loss for a prompt and unhesitating
answer. The cause may be subjective rather than objective: the historians may look at
history from a wrong angle, so that the shadows are exaggerated or intensified. On the
other hand, it may really be, as Shakespeare seemed to think, that the effects of evil
are actually more permanent than those of good. And there is a third alternative which
the philosophical historian and the historical philosopher cannot dismiss out of hand:
history is the tale of men's communal actions, and it may be that man is so incompletely
a political animal that his communal actions are more often evil than good.</p>

<p>We cannot answer these questions, but they rise naturally from a consideration of
Professor Hazen's volume. The first question which a reviewer has to put to himself is
"What is the object of this book?" The object of Professor Hazen's is obvious: it is a
text-book, a rapid survey of a period of history which, as he rightly says, possesses "a
unity that is quite exceptional among the so-called 'periods' of history." As a text-book
it has great merits; it is accurate and brief, it runs with great rapidity through all the
more important facts of its "period," and the author's opinions and prejudices are
severely repressed. It has some obvious faults: the author seems to us ill-advised to
have added his last chapter in the form and size adopted by him. This chapter deals
with the actual events of the world war, and occupies nearly a quarter of the entire book.
This throws the whole of his book out of shape. The war in itself had, of course,
enormous importance, but the details of its progress are of little importance in a survey
like this. In the previous pages we have been whirled from the Balkan question to the
Irish, from the Irish question to the rise of Japan, from the rise of Japan
to the Russian internal struggle, and many of these immense complicated problems
have necessarily been dismissed in a few pages. There is no room in a book on this
scale for a description of the campaigns of the war, and Professor Hazen's volume
loses rather than gains by his attempt to deal with them. But as a text-book it has merits
above the average. One great merit is inherent in it&mdash;it looks at history not from a
national but a European or world angle. We are inclined to believe that for use in schools
no histories of "France," "England," or other individual countries should be tolerated,
that all history should be either of Europe, Asia, of some continent or era, or of the
world. And then, perhaps, historians might be able to deal a little more with the good
that men do communally than with the evil.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE TANK CORPS. By <span class="smcap">Major Clough Williams-Ellis, M.C.</span>, and <span class="smcap">A. Williams-Ellis</span>.
With an Introduction by <span class="smcap">Major-General H. J. Elles, C.B., D.S.O.</span>
<i>Country Life.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This is, if not an official, at least a semi-official history of the Tank Corps; and if the other
arms of our fighting forces get histories as good they will be fortunate. It contains the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
whole story of the machine and of those who manned it&mdash;invention, manufacture,
organisation, training, use&mdash;from the nebulous beginnings in the minds of the various
gentlemen whose claims to paternity are now being disputed to the last battle of 1918.
The information has an air of final authority: official reports are backed with copious
personal narrative. There is no attempt at fine writing; the book is a long series of
short paragraphs containing essential facts. Yet, when occasion demands, the authors'
terse sentences are far more vivid and more full of emotion than are the elaborate pages
of the professional battle-painters. This is never more noticeable than in their chapter
on the "Battle of Cambrai," where the fortunes of the whole Tank experiment were at
stake. Nothing is elaborated, yet we see very vividly the whole panorama of those days
of intense surreptitious preparation, and the final overwhelming advance against the
enemy, whose suspicions had been aroused too late. The authors finally dispose of the
story that the General's last order to his Tanks told them to "do their damnedest."
"That spurious fosterling he hated the more the more he perceived its popularity."
The authentic Order is given: a brief restrained document ending "5. I propose
leading the attack of the Centre Division." This he did, in the "Hilda," which reached
the outposts line in the van of the battle, General Elles standing with his head through
the hatch picking up targets for the gunners. The "Hilda's" flag was several times hit,
but not brought down. It was at this battle that sixteen Tanks were knocked out by one
gun, served single-handed by a German officer, who died at his post. The story of the
Tanks that crossed a canal on the back of another does not seem to be verified. The
authors' conclusion is that "in the phase at which military science has arrived, and at
which it will probably remain for a generation, a superior force of Tanks can always top
the scales of the military balance of power." The illustrations are many and well chosen.
We recommend the book, both as a work of reference and as a book to read.</p>

<h4 class="left">ABRAHAM LINCOLN: THE PRACTICAL MYSTIC. By <span class="smcap">Francis Grierson</span>.
With an introduction by John Drinkwater. John Lane. 5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Grierson states that Abraham Lincoln was "the greatest practical mystic the
world has known for nineteen hundred years," thus unnecessarily challenging comparisons
with Saint Teresa and others. His book, both as an effort to sustain this thesis
and as a book to read, is something of a disappointment. Some of his earlier works&mdash;notably
the beautiful <i>Valley of Shadows</i>&mdash;are closely thought and admirably written;
the best have never had in full the credit they deserve. But the present volume
is little more than a small scrap-book of other people's impressions and anecdotes of
Lincoln, sprinkled with Mr. Grierson's not very profound comments and assertions
to the effect that we are now at the end of a dispensation, and are emerging into
"the mystical dawn of a new day." That Lincoln was a very great and a very good man
we know, and that he lived in the light of conscience. Of such we can never be told too
much, and the book might well serve as an introduction to more elaborate biographies.
But we cannot say that Mr. Grierson adds anything to our knowledge. He tells us
of Lincoln's sense of duty, his dedication to the service of his kind, his premonitions.
"One of the most memorable mystical demonstrations ever recorded in any epoch
occurred in the little town of Salem, Illinois, in August, 1837, when Lincoln was only
twenty-three years of age," and "some of his deepest thoughts on the mysteries of life
and death were never voiced by this man, who never spoke unless he deemed it imperative
to speak." The New York <i>Times</i> says this or that, the <i>Spectator</i> says so-and-so;
Lincoln was a "unique" manifestation of the Supreme Mind, like Moses. "The
American people were at that time practical, democratic seers, without whom the
greatest practical mystic could not have existed." These passages are not cheering.
There is an introduction by Mr. John Drinkwater, who says something and says it
clearly.</p>

<h4 class="left">MEN AND MANNERS IN PARLIAMENT. By <span class="smcap">Sir Henry Lucy</span>. Fisher Unwin.
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Sir Henry Lucy's reprint of his notes on the Disraeli Parliament of 1874 will find a place
in that world-museum where a bottle containing the Bruce's spider stands next on the
shelf to the original kettle which inflamed the young imagination of George Stephenson.
They were published serially in (how distant it all seems!) the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
and a set of bound volumes of that venerable periodical found its way (by the steam-packet,
no doubt) to the young republic of the United States. There in the beautiful
new-world calm of the Chancellor Green Library, at Princeton, the old printed words
in their quaint black-letters met the young eye of Woodrow Wilson, a smart student of
his seniors, Chatham, Burke, and Brougham, of the more recent writings of Lord
Macaulay, then recently dead, and of the positively burning message of the still more
topical Mr. Bagehot. But it was Sir Henry Lucy, not yet dubbed a Knight, who produced,
if we may believe the official biographer&mdash;and Sir Henry does&mdash;an "influence ...
on his broadening thought." The debt was very gracefully acknowledged by the
President long afterwards in a letter which pays tribute to "the interest you stirred
many years ago in the action of public affairs in Great Britain." He added that he would
always think of Sir Henry as one of his instructors.</p>

<p>The whole story is one more example of the ineradicable romanticism of the
New World which led Henry James to the belief that great leaders in England
conversed intelligently (if not always quite intelligibly) and drew Whistler to dramatise
the Thames. One sees the American undergraduate hanging spellbound over Sir Henry
Lucy's parliamentary notes, and rising from the table with bright eyes and burning
cheeks to mutter, as he walked out among the chipmunks and prairie foxes, "I too will
hold assemblies in the grip of my eloquence like the Right Honourable George Sclater-Booth;
in me Mr. Knatchbull-Hugessen shall have his transatlantic counterpart."
And one is inclined to wonder, as one rambles through the pages of what the President,
remembering his constitutional obligations to the American language, described as
"The Syndicated London Letter," which of these amiable pages of political gossip it was
that finally tilted the young Wilson on to that inclined plane which led to Washington
and the Galerie des Glaces. Was it the picture of Mr. Disraeli on the Treasury Bench,
impassive, arms folded, forelock well in evidence, or the more vivacious scenes in
which Mr. Bright, Mr. Gladstone, and Mr. Lowe chased one another across the Mid-Victorian
stage? No one except Mr. Wilson can say. But the anecdote lends point to the
reissue of Sir Henry's notes, which always possess a high interest for political historians,
apart from the addition which the story makes to their intrinsic value.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE LIFE AND LETTERS OF LADY DOROTHY NEVILL. By <span class="smcap">Ralph Nevill</span>.
Methuen. 18<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This is a most disappointing book. Of Lady Dorothy's charm and intelligence we have
had evidence in the two volumes published in her lifetime, and edited by Mr. Nevill.
She certainly deserved a biography which should preserve for posterity a true portrait
of one who typified what was best and most likeable in a state of society that became
historical even in her lifetime. Unfortunately, Mr. Nevill has been content to give us
merely gleanings of his mother's notebooks and post-bag. He makes no effort at
all at formal biography, keeps no sequence, and betrays no sense of proportion. The
writing of the book is slack and formless, as, for instance, in such sentences as the
following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No one probably knew more about the inner social history of her time than Lady Cork;
a very clever woman, who long after she had ceased to be able to leave her couch, owing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
her numerous visitors, kept herself excellently posted as to everything of interest which was
on foot. At the time of the Druce case, being a confirmed invalid, her evidence, which
would have completely put any claimant out of court, was taken on commission.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The book is full of writing as careless as this, and is, in consequence, very trying to
read. All one can do is to search through the volume for amusing stories of the world
Lady Dorothy Nevill adorned, and to make some guess at the character of the woman
who could number among her friends Lord Clanricarde, Father Dolling, Lord
Beaconsfield, Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Lytton, and Mr. John Burns.</p>

<p>The second task is difficult. One knows her better from that glowing portrait by
Watts&mdash;which we wish Mr. Nevill had reproduced&mdash;than from any of her letters given
here. She was not a good letter-writer, though better than some of her correspondents.
She had both generosity and an aptitude for mischief, stout prejudices, but a lovable
curiosity which prevented her being their slave. Her Toryism was of the "Young
England" variety, and never stopped her from making friends where she could. Her
wit seems to have been a wit of personality rather than of mind, almost a spiritual
glow which is rarely apparent in the printed page. Of her family life we are told
practically nothing&mdash;not even the date of Mr. Reginald Nevill's death is given.</p>

<p>Many of the anecdotes in the book are old, but we have not met this before. Lady
Pollington, Lady Dorothy Nevill's sister, "adored dancing, her love of which may be
realised when it is stated that the night before her only son was born she was at Lady
Salisbury's dance in Arlington Street till one-thirty and her son was born at three."
New to us also is the story of the petition presented to the United States Congress
"by some zealots who entertained strong religious objections against the use of oil."
Mr. Nevill does not assign its precise date, but gives it as an instance of "mid-Victorian
bigotry."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The signatories to this remarkable document prayed that a stop might be put to the
irreverent and irreligious proceedings of various citizens in drawing petroleum from the
bosom of the earth, thus "checking the designs of the Almighty," Who, they said, had
undoubtedly stored it there with a view to the last day, "when all things shall be destroyed."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Mr. Nevill tells us one thing about his mother which possibly reveals her character
and the temper of her time more truly than anything else in the book: it seems to belong
to the England of General Gordon and Lady Burton. Lady Dorothy practised
illumination, presumably as taught in the once popular Owen Jones' volume.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One of the works she executed was Hood's <i>Song of the Shirt</i>, another was <i>The Service
for the Burial of the Dead</i>, which she finished and signed in 1848, when twenty-two years of
age&mdash;a curious instance of the strange mixture of seriousness and vivacity which went to
form a highly original mind.</p></blockquote>

<h3>POLITICS AND ECONOMICS</h3>

<h4 class="left">INDUSTRY AND TRADE. By <span class="smcap">Alfred Marshall</span>. Macmillan. 18<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Dr. Marshall's well-known <i>Principles of Economics</i> was published as long ago as 1890.
For many years he continued to work at the volume with which he designed to follow
that, but weak health, as well as heavy professional duties and much time devoted to
the public service, made his progress slow. It is only now, therefore, after an interval of
nearly thirty years, that he has been able to complete the present book. And even so his
scheme is not yet complete, for there is still a companion volume to come, which will
deal with "influences on the conditions of man's life and work exerted by the resources
available for employment; by money and credit; by international trade; and by social
endeavour."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
<i>Industry and Trade</i> is a monument of lucidity and carefulness. Every student of
economics will read it with interest, even though it does not appear to throw much new
light on the problems it discusses. Dr. Marshall traces out for us in a general way the
technical evolution of industry, both in this country and elsewhere. We have an analysis
of the conditions which produced in turn the industrial leadership of Britain, of France,
of Germany, of the United States. We have a minute discussion of the dominant
tendencies of business organisations, the expansion of the unit, the application of
scientific method, the problems of joint-stock companies, of banking, of marketing.
And finally the question of monopolies is examined&mdash;the American and German
experience of trusts and cartels, the great movement towards aggregation, federation,
and co-operation in British trade. Dr. Marshall writes throughout in a spirit of large and
rather fatherly benevolence, here reproving some "anti-social practices" of trade
unionism, there gently censuring abuses of power by a trust. It is admirable, of course,
but there are times when his elaborate avoidance of partisanship and his cautious
non-committal attitude leave the reader a little perplexed. Dr. Marshall tells us that his
aim has been to present as accurate a picture as he can without advocating any particular
conclusions. This is very well in a general way, but where an economic problem becomes
an ethical problem a conclusion may not be an altogether bad thing. There are two
chapters devoted to a consideration of "Scientific Management," in which the author
has certainly achieved an almost superhuman impartiality. He thinks, as everyone does,
that there is much that is valuable in the application of efficiency methods in industry.
He does not think that the worker need be unduly strained by scientific management.
He is apparently doubtful about the danger of monotony that it introduces. Finally, he
suggests that "though it be true that scientific management diminishes the need of the
operative for resource and judgment in small matters, it may help him ... to
estimate the characters of those who bear large responsibilities. Unless and until he
can do that, democratic control of industry will be full of hazards." True, but some
bolder critics will turn back a few pages and refer to a quotation given of some of Mr.
F. W. Taylor's principles: "All possible brain-work should be removed from the shop
and centred in the planning department, leaving for the foreman and gang-bosses work
strictly executive in its nature.... Each man must ... adapt his methods
to the many new standards and grow accustomed to receiving and obeying directions
covering details large and small, which in the past have been left to his individual
judgment." Will a manipulation of human beings on these lines really make ideal
"democratic controllers of industry"? Leaving the desirability or undesirability of
such control out of the question it will certainly be argued that Mr. Taylor's is
not the way to get it. However, Dr. Marshall admits that American methods of
scientific management will need to be somewhat modified before they can obtain a
very wide acceptance in British industry. He does not discuss how they are being
modified in their application in this country, where a good many experiments are
actually being made.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In general, the book presents us with a pretty bright picture of capitalist industry.
There is much that needs to be altered, yet progress, we are reminded, has been great:
education has spread, the standard of comfort of the working-class has risen enormously,
and "both competition and combination in Anglo-Saxon countries generally have been
more inclined to construction than to destruction: emulation has often given an incitement
to exertion stronger than that which was derived from the desire for gain...."
We are not to be led away, therefore, by large socialistic schemes of reform. Collectivism
would be unfavourable to the best solution of men for the most responsible work in
industry; National Guilds "look only at the surface difficulties of business" and
promise to lead us into nothing but chaos.</p>

of Political Economy in the University of Edinburgh). King. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Until the other day we all thought we were threatened with national bankruptcy, and
a great many people think so still, despite the recent rapid conversion to optimism
of the Government and the House of Commons. Professor Nicholson, we are sure, is
not one of those who are impressed by the change. His interesting and outspoken little
book may be summed up in two sentences&mdash;"The principal cause of the disorder of the
body politic is the abuse of paper money," and "Our present need is to get back to a
sound monetary system and to get rid of the mirage of inflation." He does not believe
in the theory that an internal debt "makes no difference": that it is merely a transference
from one set of pockets to another. And he does not think that the burden of the debt
can be removed either by a capital levy or by a continuance of inflation, which, as he
gloomily observes, is a popular remedy, both with the industrial and commercial classes.
If that continues, its evils will continue&mdash;high profits, high wages, higher prices, and a
general scarcity. The great practical difficulty is to stop the rise in prices. It may be done
partly by greater output and lower profits, partly by reduced public expenditure, but,
above all, by a reduction in the volume of paper currency. For that, Professor
Nicholson observes, moral courage is needed, and also hard thinking.</p>

<h4 class="left">IRISH IMPRESSIONS. By <span class="smcap">G. K. Chesterton</span>. Collins. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>"These are the notes of a visit to Ireland during the dark days when a last effort was
made to undo the blunders that had wrecked the great promise of Irish recruitment."
Mr. Chesterton, in lamenting the fact that a large section of the Irish population
remained neutral in the war, blames both sides. The case against England and the
British Government is familiar; but, he argues, however badly Ireland may have been
treated in the past, and however the Irish situation was mishandled in the early days of
the war, the Sinn Feiners are still to be blamed. They were as men who should have
abstained from Marathon because of a quarrel with some archon, or refused to fight
Attila because of a grievance against Ætius. All civilization was at stake; that being so,
even the claims of nationality should have been, if necessary, postponed&mdash;though, in
fact, they would have been actually assisted had Ireland made the plunge. Mr. Chesterton
states with characteristic force the existence of a definite Irish nationality, a thing
to be perceived in any Irish home. As a practical politician he believes that the extreme
demand for separation can still&mdash;though time presses&mdash;be effaced if Dominion Home
Rule is offered. The bargaining peasant lives in the fighting rebel; and when even the
last Home Rule scheme was postponed a genuine disappointment was to be seen
throughout Ireland.</p>

<p>This is his central case. He argues it characteristically: that is to say, his method
of exposition, by means of rapid generalizations, digressions, witticisms, allusions,
will fascinate those who believe there is great sagacity behind his fireworks, and irritate
or bore those who habitually dislike him. In making out a case for Ireland he also makes
out a case for a rural, a Catholic, and a "distributive" civilisation. Everywhere there are
quotable sayings. He speaks of "the brilliant bitterness of Dublin and the stagnant
optimism of Belfast." "Modern industrial society," he says, "is fond of problems,
and therefore not at all fond of solutions."</p>

<p>Arguing that on the outbreak of war England abjured her pro-Teutonist delusions,
he says the Sinn Feiners fatally played with the thing they had always denounced:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That is why the Easter rising was really a black and insane blunder. It was not because
it involved the Irish in a military defeat; it was because it lost the Irish a great controversial
victory. The rebel deliberately let the tyrant out of a trap; out of the grinning
jaws of the gigantic trap of a joke.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">"Imperialism," he observes, "is not an insanity of patriotism; it is merely an illusion
of cosmopolitanism." Such epigrams&mdash;and there is always something in them&mdash;are all
over the book; but in two places, where he is talking of the war and of Kettle's death
and where he celebrates the Christian virtues of charity and humility, he reaches an
eloquence almost comparable to that of the magnificent passage at the close of his <i>Short
History of England</i>. That passage deserves to go into all anthologies of English prose
henceforth compiled.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE HANDMAIDEN OF THE NAVY. By <span class="smcap">G. S. Doorly</span>. Williams &amp; Norgate.
6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>There are still two books which ought to be written about the war. One is a
real novel of the adventures and sufferings of the Merchant Service, and the
other is a historical account of the partnership between the Navy and the
Merchant Service, and that marvellous convoy organisation which unobtrusively
won the war. Mr. Doorly ought to help with the latter, but we hope
he will not attempt the former. These stories, collected under a cumbrous and not
too accurate title, are a painstaking but disappointing attempt to deal with both. Mr.
Doorly has not the literary gifts necessary to do complete justice to the human side of
his subject, though he faithfully pictures the very real camaraderie which the convoy
established between the naval officer and the mercantile marine. All his sailors are of
the "hearty" type made familiar by "Bartimeus" and the Press. His troopships
"plough their way across the leagues of ocean towards the great-little island home."
The sinking of a ship is "another foul victory for the wretched Hun." It is a pity,
because Mr. Doorly has clearly had a wide experience, and gives the fullest account
we have yet seen of the intricacies and anxieties of convoy organisation and escort work,
though the convoy of his stories is a primitive affair compared with the perfected
form of 1918. He is technically accurate and very thorough, and does not shrink from
explaining such complexities as the methods of "zigzagging," and he has an eye for
the humorous sides of submarine warfare. But his accounts of exciting moments
frankly do not excite, and the merchant captain who says "'Tut-tut,' swallowing a
lump in his throat," does not move us as perhaps he should. Yet it is an interesting
little book, and until the theme receives the treatment it deserves, we hope it will be
read.</p>

<h4 class="left">POLAND AND THE POLES. By <span class="smcap">A. Bruce Boswell</span>. Methuen. 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This is a useful and interesting book. It is, as Mr. Boswell says in his Preface, a series of
essays. In these essays he deals with the Polish people, their national characteristics,
their country, history, literature, music, and art, their industry and commerce, and
their future. Poland, which has for centuries exercised a fascination over the romantic
mind, always makes good reading; and Mr. Boswell communicates his enthusiasm.
He is perhaps not altogether untouched by that partisanship which seems almost
inevitably to fall upon the foreigner who becomes intimately associated with any
nation. The truth is that all the peoples of the earth have so many good qualities that it
is impossible for anyone who is brought into contact with any one of them not to feel
for it occasionally as a lover or a child. Mr. Boswell certainly feels for Poland as a lover,
and his book is none the worse for that. At first, however, we thought that he was to
prove one of those whose love of a particular nation engenders hate of other nations.
Indeed, we hardly think that he is altogether fair to Russians, Jews, and others.
But his prejudices are mild compared to those of most historians, and, despite his frank
bias towards the Polish outlook, when he comes to deal with so vexed a question as that
of the Ukraine he displays a praiseworthy impartiality.</p>

<span class="smcap">T. J. Pryce Jenkins</span>, and <span class="smcap">R. Vivian Mostyn</span>. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson, 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Every man is more or less an athlete, and training begins in the cradle and ends with
the grave&mdash;at least it should do. Unfortunately many people of our generation were
brought up in the languid atmosphere of Victorianism where ill-health was tolerated,
almost worshipped. In due time we went to school&mdash;if it was summer we played cricket;
if winter, we played football; if spring, we ran races and jumped jumps and threw
hammers; but as for any real education in physical culture or athletics we had none.
Every young athlete should read <i>Success in Athletics</i>, for in it he will find very simple
and very excellent advice as to how to train for every branch of field sport. The elements
of success upon which stress is laid are as follows: First, to choose a branch of athletics
suitable to the build of the individual. Second, to build up the necessary muscles by
training at home and in the gymnasium long before practices are carried out on the
track. Third, to study the scientific side of the particular sport chosen, so as to acquire
a perfect style and to economise energy to the utmost extent.</p>

<p>The book begins very properly with a tribute of respect to athletes who have fallen in
the war; then chapters follow on running, jumping, hurdling, and throwing weights of
all descriptions; there are also chapters on diet, massage, and clothing, and an appendix
on leg exercises. The book is illustrated with admirable photographs, but it is a pity
that these are not placed more in accordance with the text. The chapter on "Hurdling"
is among the best. The hurdler must be "tall, fairly slim, and well 'split up,'" which
being interpreted means that his height must be contained in his legs rather than in his
body. He must build up the strength of his legs by special exercises, such as high kicking,
the splits, and skipping; and there is yet another admirable exercise&mdash;the athlete, in a
sitting position, puts himself into the attitude of a hurdler topping a hurdle, the left leg
is stretched straight out, the right leg is at right angles to it, the knee is bent and the
inside of the leg is resting on the ground. The exercise consists in raising the body so
that only the left heel and the inner side of the right calf are resting on the ground. It is
a most painful and excellent exercise.</p>

<p>We are glad to see that in the chapter on diet athletes are warned against an excess of
meat; one good meat meal a day is all that is recommended. Meat, besides its nourishment,
contains many poisonous substances which are with difficulty eliminated
from the system. Many a good athlete has been wasted through inattention to this
fact. The chapter on massage is to our mind inadequate.</p>

<p>In the last chapter the following passage occurs: "... it is felt that a new epoch
of athleticism in Great Britain is about to commence&mdash;that an entirely new breed of
athletes will arise or be recruited from the ranks of those who through four and a half
years of war have learned the true meaning of discipline and the importance of
close attention to the least little detail of instruction." Now we all feel that something
good must come after all this suffering and slaughter; the Briton has proved that he is
possessed of true greatness; how can this greatness be turned to full account? Let
us give up once for all this idea of record-breaking and producing freaks who can jump
an inch higher than any other man or throw a hammer a foot farther. At best that is a
very low ideal, and such over-specialisation produces ugliness and unhealthiness. The
only kind of athlete that we want to contemplate is the all-round athlete who can run
fast and far, jump high and broad, and have sufficient strength for heavy events. An
instance of what we mean occurs in this book&mdash;the pictures of A. E. Flaxman show a
magnificent athlete of about eleven stone; such a man would have to compete in heavy
events with mountains of flesh weighing twenty stone; hence all Flaxman's symmetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
and grace and style are wasted, and the mountain wins the points for his side. This is all
wrong. We should abandon the practice of selecting one athlete for one event. We should
have teams composed of all-round athletes, each of whom competes in all events; these
athletes will not break records, but they will be super-athletes such as a great nation
should aim at producing. When we have got rid of this odious specialisation it will be
time to aim still higher, and produce not only the all-round athlete but the all-round
man, made up of mind, character, and muscle, all developed to the utmost extent.</p>

<h3>PHILOSOPHY</h3>

<h4 class="left">AN INVISIBLE KINGDOM. By <span class="smcap">W. S. Lilly</span>. Chapman &amp; Hall. 15<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The late Mr. Lilly was a Roman Catholic journalist who combined attachment to his
faith with adherence to a benevolent paternalism in politics. This posthumous volume,
edited by Dr. William Barry, is partly concerned with political and sociological problems,
though there are two essays on <i>Memory</i> and <i>Sleep</i> which do little but review current
opinion on those two functions. The political essays suffer from their date. Although fond
of appeals to history, Mr. Lilly discusses the affairs of the moment from the angle of
the moment; there is much talk of universality, but very little application. Indeed at
times one doubts if he could have seen the precise significance of his opinions. For
instance, he was a determined opponent of democracy, and quotes with approval
Mill's statement that "Equal voting is in principle wrong"; and he proceeds to state
a doctrine of political justice which does not differ in principle from that stated by
Trotsky. Where Mr. Lilly and Trotsky would differ is, of course, on the question into
whose hands political power was to be put. Also one finds it difficult to understand
how a Roman Catholic can agree&mdash;as Mr. Lilly does&mdash;with Ibsen's creed, "The
minority is always right." Here are Mr. Lilly's words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If there is one lesson written more legibly than another in the annals of the world it is
that majorities are almost always wrong; but that is the prerogative of minorities&mdash;nay,
it may even be of a minority of one. That is the verdict of history. It holds good of all ages.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Mr. Lilly might contend that he is not bound to square his opinions with St. Augustine's
<i>Securus judicat orbis terrarum</i>; but how can his statement be reconciled with the practice
of his Church? All General Councils, which decide Catholic dogma, have come to
their decisions by taking a vote and accepting the verdict of the majority. This has been
so from the Council of Jerusalem to the Vatican Council. Are we to believe that only
in matters ecclesiastical the minority is wrong?</p>

<p>Mr. Lilly was also rather apt to substitute mere statement for argument. Thus, in
discussing the modern position of women, he writes:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Of course reason itself declares that on the physical and psychical inequality of the sexes,
and on the willing obedience of the weaker, the happiness of both depends. It is the lesson
which Shakespeare has worked out, with consummate art, in the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It is evident that, whatever may be thought by a modern man or woman about the
equality of the sexes, no satisfactory argument can be based on the premise that women's
physical and psychical inferiority is an axiom. In his discussion on Socialism and on Trades
Unions, Mr. Lilly displays the same incapacity to understand his opponent's starting-point.
He has plenty of sense and a desire for fairness which makes him quote Aquinas'
declaration on riches&mdash;that they are only lawful if they are possessed justly and used
in a proper manner for the owner and others&mdash;and apply it to modern fortunes. His
last essay is on Newman, and is rather inadequate, as it appears to have been written
without reference to Mr. Wilfrid Ward's life. It is too early to write about that excessively<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
human, lovable spirit in the artificial language of the official hagiographer: there
are, however, sentences which arouse interest. We do not remember seeing it stated
before that, late in life, Newman "perused translations of <i>The Critiques of the Pure</i> and
<i>The Practical Reason</i>, pen in hand&mdash;that was his usual way&mdash;and made some notes on
them." It would be interesting to see these notes.</p>

<h4 class="left">EMERSON AND HIS PHILOSOPHY. By <span class="smcap">J. Arthur Hill</span>. W. Rider. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
net.</h4>

<p>This brief essay on Emerson is marked by enthusiasm, and shows evidence of a wide
acquaintance with Emerson's works, but is otherwise unremarkable. Mr. Hill gives a
brief biography of his hero, and then discusses him in relation to his views on religion,
science, with chapters on Emerson's style, poetry, and criticism. His last chapter is
a brief <i>résumé</i> of <i>English Traits</i> and <i>Representative Men</i>, treating those very readable
books as if they were essays in some unknown language. Mr. Hill's own opinions
hardly inspire one with confidence in his capacity to interpret emotions.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Beautiful language, true poetry, often contains little truth and not much passion; we
feel that the poetry is in the beauty of the images evoked, or in the sheer unanalysable charm
of the words as sounds, or&mdash;more generally&mdash;both combined. The more "thought" there
is in poetry the less poetical it is.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">There is much virtue in inverted commas, and no doubt "thought" is absent from
the <i>Antigone</i>, the <i>Divina Commedia</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Paradise Lost</i>, <i>Tintern Abbey</i>, and <i>The
Ring and the Book</i>; but we cannot follow Mr. Hill in his contention that these poems
lack truth or passion. Nor indeed can we remember any poem of which his remark
would be true. Mr. Hill's observations on Emerson's style and his biographical portions
of the essay are not quite so off the mark. Few readers will accept his very high estimate
of Emerson, and he fails to remove our suspicion that the great American writer, who
was never known to laugh, was at times perilously near being an ordinary prig. As to
Emerson's influence on his contemporaries and successors, it is generally underestimated.
The <i>Essays</i> in particular are always a delight to youth, and are read with avidity
by boys at the most impressionable age. A great deal of modern individualism, of
modern defiance, which is often put down to the discredit of Ibsen, or Nietzsche, or
Blake, is really due to Emerson. He was the first eminent man to preach disobedience
as an ethical duty; his conscience was always uneasy if he caught himself conforming;
and this uneasiness, which a more vigorous man in a more natural society would have
recognised as an emotional mood, Emerson distorted into a kind of council of perfection.
"Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist," he proclaims exaltedly, not seeing
that this sentiment has, as a generalisation, already been contradicted by his birth
and his marriage, and is to be finally quashed by his death.</p>

<h3>SCIENCE</h3>

<h4 class="left">A TREATISE ON GYROSCOPIC AND ROTATIONAL MOTION. By <span class="smcap">Andrew
Gray, F.R.S.</span> Macmillan. 42<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It was quite time that we had in English a standard treatise on gyroscopic motion.
Space is, of course, devoted to the subject in various well-known text-books on rigid
dynamics, and there are one or two good little books of an elementary nature, such as
Perry's <i>Spinning Tops</i> and Crabtree's <i>Spinning Tops and Gyroscopic Motion</i>, but hitherto
the man in search of detailed information on problems concerning tops in the widest
sense has had to go to Klein and Sommerfeld's <i>Theorie des Kreisels</i>, if he could not find
what he wanted in Sir George Greenhill's <i>Report</i>. That Professor Gray should be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
man to supply our want is only fitting. At the University of Glasgow, where he succeeded
to the chair of Natural Philosophy left vacant by Lord Kelvin's death, an interest in
gyroscopic motion is traditional, and Professor Gray inherited a collection of apparatus
for experiment in this field which he has extended by many ingenious and convenient
forms of gyroscope described in the book before us. His own researches on the general
dynamics of gyroscopic systems have added clearness to that branch of applied mathematics,
and his son is an expert in the design and application of practical gyrostats.
A judicious combination of experimental and theoretical treatment forms the great
attraction of Professor Gray's book.</p>

<p>The problems of gyroscopic motion range from the behaviour of the schoolboy's top
to that of this great top, the earth, and include a great number of engineering applications.
The torpedo is kept in its course by a gyroscope; the gyroscopic compass, which
makes no use of magnetic properties, has rendered possible the navigation of a submerged
submarine; Schlich invented a gyroscopic apparatus, which has been tried
successfully in small ships, for keeping a vessel from rolling in a rough sea; with
Brennan's monorail the car is kept upright by means of a gyroscopic device; and many
other ingenious uses have been made of the seemingly paradoxical properties of spinning
tops. The gyroscopic compass is, unfortunately, not treated in Professor Gray's book,
nor is there any account of other naval and military applications of the gyroscope, since
the author, finding that the official secrecy, necessarily imposed at the time of writing,
would prevent him giving anything but a fragmentary account, has preferred to reserve
his discussion of these appliances to a promised second volume. Very little is said of the
monorail (in fact, Brennan's name is not mentioned), which is less explicable. Many
practical applications of gyroscopic theory to such problems as the drift of projectiles,
golf balls, and boomerangs (the last-named treated necessarily in a very general manner)
come up for consideration, and the forgotten diabolo, child of a passing craze, is resurrected
to provide an example of the effect of equality of the principal moments of inertia
on the stability of rotation of a body under no forces. Most attention is, however, given
to the first two subjects mentioned above&mdash;the top spinning on a flat surface, and the
earth spinning through space&mdash;which are, of course, the classical problems in rotational
dynamics. It need scarcely be said that Sir George Greenhill's work is abundantly
cited.</p>

<p>"In the present work my aim has been to refer, as far as possible, each gyrostatic
problem directly to first principles, and to derive the solutions by steps which could be
interpreted at every stage of the progress," says the author in his preface, and he has
followed this aim with considerable success. It is, of course, impossible to treat many
of the problems of rotational dynamics without mathematical analysis of some complexity,
and a knowledge of elliptic functions and such-like weapons of the applied
mathematician lies, perhaps, outside the scope of the average engineer and inventor.
Professor Gray, who deplores the present ignorance of inventors in the matter of
gyroscopic motion, has kept the needs of this class before him, and has taken care to
arrange his matter so that those who cannot always follow the mathematical exposition
given can, at least, gain a clear knowledge of the results. The first chapter, which
contains no mathematical symbols, forms an excellent introduction to the subject and
is quite elementary, and elsewhere in the book, when practical problems, such as the
drift of a projectile, are being discussed, the nature of the investigation is stated as
simply as may be. Throughout the inquiry is illustrated, as far as possible, by experiment
and diagram.</p>

<p>"Les Anglais enseignent la méchanique comme une science expérimentale; sur le
continent, on l'expose toujours plus ou moins comme une science déductive et <i>a priori</i>.
Ce sont les Anglais qui ont raison, cela va sans dire." In these words, the late Henri
Poincaré, the greatest mathematician of his generation, praised the British tradition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
teaching dynamics as an experimental subject, which is so well maintained in this book.
Some specialists, no doubt, will find minor omissions in their subject, but, on the whole,
with the exceptions already noted, the book is very complete. It is printed with the
well-known elegance in all that pertains to mathematical symbols of the firm of Robert
Maclehose, and the general production is very good. We do not understand, however,
why the illustrations in the first chapter are nearly all reproduced a second time further
on in the book, especially as they are mostly photographs of apparatus, which do not
necessitate frequent reference. And&mdash;the question that has to be asked so often with
English books&mdash;why is the index so defective?</p>

<h4 class="left">EVERYDAY EFFICIENCY: A PRACTICAL GUIDE TO EFFICIENT LIVING.
By <span class="smcap">Forbes Lindsay</span>. W. Rider &amp; Son. 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It is stated in the preface that the material of this <i>Practical Guide to Efficient Living</i> has
been used extensively as a correspondence course, so that anyone who is thinking of
paying pounds to be taught by post how to be efficient can save most of his money.
All the most notable authorities on Efficiency&mdash;Ike Marvel, Buddha, Arnold Bennett,
Walter Dill Scott, Prentice Mulford, Yoritomo-Tashi, and Baudelaire (to what the last-named
said is added what he might have said)&mdash;are quoted, and many varieties of type
and a liberal use of capital letters add to the strenuousness of the book. There is much
about Ideals ("Ultimate and Other Ideals") and much about Money, much about
Character Formation and much about Vocational Efficiency. We attribute our own
inefficiency largely to the fact that we cannot whistle, for this seemingly trivial accomplishment
is of far-reaching use&mdash;"Whistle and wear a smile for fifteen minutes, and
you will most assuredly begin to feel cheerful"; "Sing and whistle as you dress."
But, again, we have not done the essential thing, which is, we are told, to read the
lessons of the Course again and again, and to devote close thought to them. Alas, we
fell a victim to Waning Will, a fault early handled in the book, and although somewhat
comforted to learn that it is a "common form of weakness," we could not bring ourselves
to adopt the cure, which is "When a resolution is formed, record it definitely in
your file under the head of Ideals, Aspirations, Tasks, Duties, or other appropriate
designation." The appropriate designation for the reading of this book is undoubtedly
Task. The author, who has also written books entitled <i>Efficiency</i> and <i>The Psychology
of a Sale</i>, is a man who has evidently obeyed his own great precept, "Don't admit
any limit to your attainment and capacity." His intense self-respect will prevent him
feeling hurt on learning that a smile is the only aid to efficiency which we have derived
from his book.</p>

<h4 class="left">ANAPHYLAXIS AND ANTI-ANAPHYLAXIS. By <span class="smcap">Dr. A. Besredka</span>. English
Edition by S. Roodhouse Gloyne. Heinemann. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Medical research bears so directly on the well-being of every one of us that it is astonishing
that more people do not take an interest in it. The existing indifference may be
attributed partly to the lack of good popular books describing recent advances in an
easily comprehensible way, partly to the nomenclature adopted by the medical profession,
which is apt to frighten the layman into imagining that the exotic polysyllables in
question can be used only for phenomena of unimaginable complexity and obscurity.
Complex they always are, of course, with the complexity of all natural manifestations,
but very often the main lines of the problems which have arisen, and the methods of
attack, can be stated in plain language. The book before us, which deals with the
profoundly interesting subject of anaphylaxis, is not avowedly written for the enlightenment
of the public, yet it is in most parts accessible to anybody with a slight knowledge
of medicine, and, not being a "popular" book, it has the advantage of being free from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
the erroneous generalisations so often introduced in presenting a branch of science to
the lay reader. The subject is described as one still in the course of development, and is
not given that false air of completion so dear to the populariser.</p>

<p>The phenomena of anaphylaxis are among the most striking in medical science, and
have only recently been investigated, for although isolated cases of what we should now
call anaphylaxis had been previously noted, Richet was the first to show the significance
and extent of the subject in his memoir of 1902, in which he established many of the
most important points. The essence of anaphylaxis is that the injection into an animal
of a small quantity of one of certain substances&mdash;which in some cases are, and in others
are not, poisons (with a poison the dose must, of course, be less than the fatal one)&mdash;puts
the animal in a particular sensitive state, so that a very small second injection produces
fatal results of a very violent and well-marked character. Some time must elapse after the
first injection for the sensitive state to establish itself, and the second injection must be
of exactly the same nature as the first, this latter fact constituting the so-called specificity
of the anaphylactic effect. This specificity has been applied for identifying blood of a
doubtful source, since an animal which has been sensitised with an injection of blood
from a given species is sensitive only to blood of the same species. Further, the blood of
an animal in the sensitive state can be used to render another animal sensitive, a result
known as passive anaphylaxis.</p>

<p>The important bearing of anaphylaxis on clinical practice is obvious. With therapeutic
sera accidents have been fairly common in the past, grave effects following a second
injection; this is a pure anaphylactic phenomenon. Much research has been done to find
out methods of preventing the anaphylactic shock, and the most important advances in
the field of anti-anaphylaxis are due to Dr. Besredka. His book naturally devotes much
space to this aspect of the study, and gives details of the successful technique which he
has developed. He worked mainly on guinea-pigs, having obtained extreme regularity of
reaction with these animals. His most important result, both from the theoretical and
the practical standpoint, is that vaccination against anaphylaxis can be produced by a
system of gradually increasing doses, starting with the injection of a very small amount
of the substance in question. This has led to a routine for serum injection by
graduated doses, which has been successful in averting serum sickness. Besredka's
interpretation of his results is against Richet's theory that the second injection
combines with a substance, the toxogenin, present in the serum as a consequence
of the first injection, and so produces a poison, the apotoxin. He considers rather
that the reaction of the injected substance, the antigen, with the substance already
formed (which he calls sensibilisin) itself produces the fatal result by disturbing the
equilibrium of certain nerve cells where the combination takes place. By graduating the
doses the reaction is watered down into a series of slight shocks, so that the great
shock produced by a single injection is spread over a comparatively large time, and
becomes innocuous. He finds an analogy between the effect and the mixing of water and
sulphuric acid. If the water is poured in quickly there is an explosive action, but if it is
added gradually the combination takes place without violence. "In our opinion the
anaphylactic poison does not exist."</p>

<p>There are a great number of interesting experiments cited in the book which we
cannot mention here. The translator has done his work well, although we do not like
some of his importations from the French. It should not be impossible to find expression
more English than "titre of toxicity" and "fulminating cases." He has added an
excellent chapter on "Recent Work on Anaphylaxis." We are glad to see at last a short
work in English on the subject, which is one of the most fascinating fields in modern
medicine. Somebody should translate and bring up to date Richet's excellent little
book. It is a pity that the nomenclature of the subject cannot be made uniform.</p>

various sciences and arts as they find application in industry and commerce. This is a
worthy object, and, on the whole, the books are simple and interesting expositions of the
utilitarian aspect of the sciences in question. There is, perhaps inevitably, a tendency to
hurry over fundamental difficulties which will not, we think, leave an intelligent student
satisfied. For instance, to say that a force is whatever changes motion, without further
explanation, may well puzzle the reader, who knows that he can push against a heavy
stone without producing any apparent motion. However, there is a distinct place for
books of this general character, which do good work by showing to a wide audience the
peaceful achievements of science and its practical aspects; they act as a counterblast to
the deadening tradition of rule of thumb. The industrial chemistry is particularly
comprehensive, and has an excellent set of original diagrams of industrial plant. The
series is well printed and well illustrated, and, for present times, moderately priced.
It deserves wide recognition.</p>

<h4 class="left">PROJECTIVE VECTOR ALGEBRA. By <span class="smcap">L. Silberstein</span>. G. Bell &amp; Sons.
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It is not often that a book appears describing an essential advance in pure mathematics
which is intelligible to the man of moderate attainments in that science&mdash;by moderate
attainments we mean such knowledge of mathematics as is picked up in one or two years
at a university. Dr. Silberstein, who is well known in this country for his original work,
especially in connection with the theory of relativity, has, in his <i>Protective Vector
Algebra</i>, developed his latest researches in geometry in a form which is attractive and
free from pedantic formalities, and has throughout aimed at simplicity of expression,
in contrast to certain modern mathematicians who endeavour to lend importance to
minor conventional problems by a bewildering display of definitions and theorems.
The essential novelty of the book, from which the whole theme is developed, is the
generalised definition of the addition of vectors, which does not need any construction of
parallel lines, but depends solely on a straight line construction making use of the points
where the vectors cut an arbitrary fixed straight line. Dr. Silberstein's definition is a
generalisation of the Euclidean one, to which it reduces if the arbitrary line just mentioned
is moved away to infinity, and if the space is Euclidean. The knowledge of
geometry which is demanded is little more than the usual postulates of projective
geometry and Desargues' theorem. From his definition the author proceeds to prove the
associative law, and then, after dealing with the equality of non-coinitial vectors, gives
many interesting uses of the generalised vector algebra. The proof of Pascal's theorem
gives a striking example of the power and simplicity of the new method, and the whole
treatment of conics will delight the student of projective geometry. Altogether the book
is a very original and striking contribution to a fascinating branch of mathematics.</p>

<h2>BOOK-PRODUCTION NOTES</h2>

<p class="center">By J. H. MASON</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> important work done by the private presses of the last twenty-five years
will probably be found to be in its results more far-reaching than that
done in any other artistic craft. For, in addition to giving the world monumental
editions of chosen works, such as the <i>Kelmscott Chaucer</i>, the <i>Doves
Bible</i>, and the <i>Ashendene Dante</i>, they have set up the right standards in
type lettering, margins, spacing, paper, illustration, and binding.</p>

<p>Even in binding they have set a standard that can be widely applied; for the linen
back and paper sides that were good enough for a Kelmscott Press book set an example
of wholesome plainness that has done a great deal to improve the task of publisher and
public. The publisher of this generation is in strong reaction, as a rule, against the
cloth gilt extra of his father and grandfather. <i>The Artistic Crafts Series</i>, edited by
Professor W. R. Lethaby, is a notable example of such a plain, useful cover. One of the
earliest, the first I think, of this series was that dealing with Bookbinding, and doubtless
this was largely the cause of the series starting right in the matter of covers. One regrets
that there wasn't a printer available to have influenced the choice of type and dimensions
of the page&mdash;the series that is satisfactory in both respects has not yet been published.</p>

<p>Type, paper, proportions of printed page and margins, and finally the cover, are the
chief matters to be considered in producing a satisfactory book, and all of these cost no
more&mdash;with the exception of paper&mdash;when right than when they are unsatisfactory.
Even in the matter of paper, there is a wide range of choice, in normal times, at every
price above the very cheapest.</p>

<p>One generally sees the best attempts at book-production in small volumes of verse.
Some of them are very attractive and show that care and thought have been spent in
producing them. Yet, as a rule, they show some weakness, some lapse, to which the
amateur is liable. The little book of verse, <i>Arcades Ambo</i>, by Lily Dougall and Gilbert
Sheldon, published by Blackwell of Oxford, is an instance. A pleasant type, based on
that of Jenson, the Venetian printer, pleasing both in design and weight (the thin lines
are not in strong contrast to the thicks), predisposes us in favour of the book at first
glance. The normal margins are good without being excessive, but they are spoilt on
most openings by the dropped beginnings of each poem. Thus, on pages 22, 23,
instead of the tail margins being three-quarters of an inch more than the head margins
(the normal), they are practically equal. The result is that the type appears uncomfortably
low on the page. Yet the good Venetian capital lines would have given an excellent
line to the top of the page. The three-line initials are not in keeping with the capitals
of the text; for their thin strokes are in too great a contrast with their thick strokes.
Moreover, they are of a different shape&mdash;note the "T" in the text, and compare with the
initial on page 22. The little black ornament in the headlines and the arrangement of
the title-page and the label are also unsatisfactory. The press work is good, the inking
of the type being full and even, and does the good design of the type full justice.</p>

<p>Another book with pleasant margins&mdash;perhaps a little more at the head would have
been an improvement&mdash;is Max Beerbohm's <i>Seven Men</i>, published by Wm. Heinemann.
(Miss Dane's <i>Legend</i> is, roughly, uniform with it.) To secure a good foredge margin
without unduly shortening the line the book is half an inch wider than the ordinary
crown octavo; this gives a squarer format, which is much preferable to the ordinary
octavo. Such a format, too, gives the binder, in case the book is thought worth a leather
binding, a chance to make a good design for the sides&mdash;the ordinary octavo precludes
certain good designs. I cannot commend the "modern" type which has been chosen
for this book; but I will discuss "modern" type on some other occasion.</p>

<h2>A LETTER FROM AMERICA</h2>

<p class="sigright">
<i>New York, November, 1919</i><br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">AMERICAN</span> life, as it now is, would seem to make original literary production
almost impossible. Energy here cannot work distinctively; it is forced at
its very birth into one or the other prepared channel. No one who has
not lived in this country can have any conception of the unrelenting and
unremitting drive that would subdue, and does subdue, all thought, all
feeling, to mediocrity. It is a drive of vast circumference: no single activity, whether
political or artistic or religious, can escape it. Religion, indeed, it has destroyed; there
is no religion in America. The experiences of religion can only be felt by the man who
has realised himself as an individual terribly separate and distinct from all others&mdash;an
individual whose soul has awful significance as a thing-in-itself, a thing eternally
unmatched, forever recognisable by God. Such conceptions cannot breathe the American
air: neither terror nor awe nor mystery have room within the borders of this sceptical
and destructive continent. The implacable rule prevails: that the soul may have no
adventures of its own.</p>

<p>"Adventures," indeed, there are, and many. You can go in for anything you like&mdash;everybody
does&mdash;provided that you go in for it in groups. You may present yourself for
the smearing of a particular brush, you may band yourself with those who have received
a similar treatment. You may become a "society man," a church worker, a Bolshevik
revolutionary, a philanderer, a writer of <i>vers libre</i>, a "realistic" sex-novelist, a Cubist,
or a Futurist; but whatever you become, you will always know precisely where you are
and precisely what will come of your being there. Every square inch of your region will
be defined. And the conventionalities of every cult are essentially identical; the set
phrases of the man about town or the church worker have the same ring as the set
phrases of the littérateur. The raisers of the standards of artistic or political revolt will
expound their theories in just the same way, except for the mere words, as the business
man will expound his. The various samples of modern American "free verse" resemble
one another quite as closely&mdash;they keep quite as deliberately clear of individual distinction&mdash;as
do the articles in the magazines of culture or the jokes in the comic sections of
the Sunday papers. Their own conventions weigh no less heavily on the unconventional
than the most hidebound provincial's do on him. Even the wicked know what is expected
of them, and they, no less than the virtuous, answer public expectation. Conventional
or unconventional, virtuous or wicked, all enact their ordered and calculable rôles
according to schedule; there can be nothing unexpected anywhere, nothing that can
startle or embarrass or discomfort or strike wonder.</p>

<p>Can we say, then, that literature, like wickedness and virtue, like religion&mdash;and, of
course, education&mdash;does not, and cannot, exist at all in America? Is it really true that
nothing at this moment can be expected from the land of Edgar Allen Poe and Walt
Whitman? Has America no authentic poet now writing, no novelist? Even granting
that American conditions are intolerable to the man of artistic impulse, and that most
artists must be paralysed by them or forced to a sterile cleverness, must there not be
some, at least, who will react?&mdash;react violently and at least interestingly and with a
certain distinction against the pressure of their period? How about Mr. Theodore
Dreiser and Mr. Edgar Lee Masters? What of the novels of Mr. Joseph Hergesheimer?
Is not Mr. Dreiser at least original? Have not critics of well-reputed judgment written,
strongly moved, of his "deep original mysticism"&mdash;that mysticism which "penetrates
the rough chaotic surface of American life" and "lays bare its primitive foundations"?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
Has not the genius of Mr. Dreiser been credited with the "impetus of a huge cosmic
plough"?</p>

<p>Yes: and in America one can understand an enthusiasm for Mr. Dreiser, but only
in America. This writer has courage, that is undeniable: the courage to look with the
naked eye at as much of American life as he can bring within his heavily-blinkered
vision. It is not a slight thing to have achieved so direct a gaze in a country where sentimental
make-believe triumphs more amazingly and more comically than in any other
country under the sun. On this account we can forgive Mr. Dreiser his unequalled
incapacity for artistic selection, his unvarying preference for making fifty or a hundred
sentences do the work of one; we can forgive him the dullness of his æsthetic nerve, his
mountainously heaped banalities of phrase, his grinding tediousness, his incoherence,
his clumsiness that produces the distressing effect of some obtruded physical deformity.
At least he has done something: he has given us a sense of the Middle West that is
almost as depressing, almost as spiritually devastating as any that actual contact with
the Middle West itself can produce. He is a realist: and it is an extraordinary feat of
heroism to be a realist in America. But if Mr. Dreiser had written in any European
country, he could not have been read. The tremendous strain that he imposes on his
readers is only tolerable because they feel that he is doing something, or, with the
throaty groans and gastric rumbles of an elderly Hercules badly out of condition, trying
to do something that no one else has found the nerve or the stomach to attempt.</p>

<p>It will be asked if Mr. Edgar Lee Masters has not also the distinction of having dared
to tell the truth in a land where, whenever truth shows itself, public opinion is instantly
on the alert to suppress it. Does not the author of the <i>Spoon River Anthology</i> expose,
powerfully and memorably, the vices of the respectable provincial bourgeois, the
"Pillars of Society"? But again the question may be raised&mdash;did the <i>Spoon River
Anthology</i> enjoy its vogue on account of its power and distinction as a work
of art, or on account of the unusualness that lay in the subjection of American
material to treatment of the kind? Guy de Maupassant had, long since, the
same idea as Mr. Edgar Lee Masters, and de Maupassant executed it with genius. If
a European, coming after de Maupassant, after Ibsen, had written such an Anthology
from, say, the Potteries, with so much less than de Maupassant's or Ibsen's power,
would his work have made any noticeable impression? Time will show&mdash;indeed it has
done much to show already&mdash;how much less formidable Mr. Masters's power is. And
how unfortunate that, induced by the success of <i>Spoon River</i>, Mr. Masters should have
committed himself to other verse&mdash;rhymed verse, schoolboy exercises limping after
models, otiose in expression, commonplace in thought. Mr. Masters writes in America:
there is nothing to keep him back.</p>

<p>Mr. Dreiser, it is true, has never done anything quite so deplorable as the later verse
of Mr. Masters: the tendencies of the author of <i>The Titan</i> and <i>The Genius</i> go another
way. Intrigued by the fantasies of pseudo-scientific speculation he has of late taken to
writing queerly and embarrassingly juvenile plays and stories about "energies" that
form the subject-matter of Physics: he makes ponderous Teutonic play with electrons
and the like. Or, stung by the crass persecution of American Puritanism, he writes
grimly and solemnly and staidly about lust, turning pornographer out of a quaint and
harassed sense of moral duty, or, it may be, merely out of obstinate combativeness,
under impulse to retaliation. Mr. Dreiser is at least a phenomenon of psychological
interest.</p>

<p>There are no poets who are in any way observable, but there is Mr. Joseph Hergesheimer,
whose novels have been highly commended on both sides of the Atlantic.
Indeed, his style, self-conscious though it is, has an unquestionable claim to serious
regard. His honesty in characterisation, his vigour, his sense of the running sap of
human existence, his energy in narrative, all mark him out. We can hardly, after our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
later experience of them, expect any new values, any development, from Mr. Dreiser or
from Mr. Masters; we can justifiably expect a good deal more from Mr. Hergesheimer
than we have yet had, for he has only begun. <i>The Three Black Pennys</i> and <i>Java Head</i>
point the way perhaps to much more considerable novels. Mr. Hergesheimer, far less
unsurely than any other American writer of to-day, gives us hope for the future of
American literature. To anyone familiar with the conditions of American life, it is
amazing that he should have been able to write so well, to advance so far under so heavy
a handicap. But, of course, no conditions of life are all-powerful. The individual will in
the end escape from under the blight and the burden of any general mass whatsoever;
partial evasions herald complete release. In ten years time, maybe&mdash;or in twenty&mdash;there
will be very different letters to be written from America.</p>

<p>News there is little. Mr. Nicholas Vachel Lindsay, the one American writer of verse
who shows signs of genius, is projecting a visit to England, and Mr. Hugh Walpole,
Lord Dunsany, and Mr. Drinkwater are touring the country as so many of their British
colleagues have done before. Mr. Walpole's addresses are very popular. Mr. Drinkwater
has been more than once to Springfield, the shrine of Abraham Lincoln, in whom he
now has a sort of property, and Lord Dunsany has been lecturing to a large audience
at the Æolian Hall in this city. His reception was marred by excited interruptions
from patriotic Irishwomen who wanted to know why he had ignored the grievances
of his country. In a despairing way he repeated again and again, "I am a poet, not a
politician."</p>

<h2>LEARNED SOCIETIES, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></h2>

<h3 class="left">THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> influence of the war is plainly seen in the Society's programme
for the coming session, and the prospect of exploring the ancient
seats of civilisation hitherto under Turkish rule will give general satisfaction.
The Latin monastic buildings of the Church of the Holy
Sepulchre will be described and illustrated, and a mosaic pavement
found at Um Jerar during the advance in Palestine will be discussed. In
Mesopotamia official excavations have been carried out at Ur of the Chaldees,
Abu Shahrain, and El-Obeid; a Sumerian figure has been found, dating from the
pre-Semitic period; and a marble slab of about 1200 <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, carved with a double-headed
eagle, has found its way to the British Museum from the neighbourhood
of Diarbekr. The heraldry of Cyprus and recent excavations in that island are other
items from abroad; but discoveries at home will not be neglected. The megalithic
monument known as Wayland's Smithy (caricatured by Scott in <i>Kenilworth</i>) was
thoroughly examined last summer; a report is promised on excavations at Templeborough,
a Roman camp between Sheffield and Rotherham; and a small ivory carving
of the later Anglo-Saxon period from St. Cross will take rank as a rarity of peculiar
charm. It reached Winchester Museum unprotected among a miscellaneous collection
of fossils.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE PHILOLOGICAL SOCIETY</h3>

<p>The Society was just preparing to recover from the loss it suffered by the death of
Dr. Furnivall when the war broke out. The officials had to do their best to keep the
Society going whilst many members were away. A tentative unofficial revival of the
annual report was made official and permanent, but several winter meetings were
suppressed on grounds of war economy. The question of a proposed official phonetic
transcription came before the Council, which also considered that of adhesion&mdash;as a
section&mdash;to the British Association. In 1917 the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Society's
foundation was celebrated. Recent publications include <i>The Tale of the Armament of
Igor</i>, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 1185, translated from the Russian by Leonard A. Magnus; an address on
Jacob Grimm; and a paper by Sir James Wilson, K.C.S.I., on <i>The Dialect of the New
Forest in Hampshire</i> (as spoken in the village of Burley). The President this year is
Sir Israel Gollancz, and the secretary Mr. Leonard C. Wharton, of 31 Greville Road,
N.W. 6. Forthcoming meetings (at University College) will be held on December 5th,
January 9th, and February 6th, the subjects being <i>Existing Parts of Speech Distinctions
have no Topical Basis</i> (Mr. H. O. Coleman), <i>A Middle English Topic</i> (Sir I. Gollancz),
and <i>The Perception of Sound</i> (Dr. W. Perrett). New members are wanted. The subscription
is a guinea.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS</h3>

<p>We are hearing at the present moment a good deal about the Enabling Bill, and
considerable interest has been evinced at the large majority which approved its second
reading. This is not without its bearing on a matter in which the Society for the Protection
of Ancient Buildings feels very strongly&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, that the laity should not only have a
voice in church legislation, but that where church buildings (which may legitimately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
be looked on as national possessions of the highest value) are concerned the public has
a right to know of improvements or additions which may be in contemplation, and to
express its approval or disapproval of any such scheme.</p>

<p>Two cases which have come to the notice of the Society within the last two months
have brought this subject again to the fore. In the present condition of things the Dean
and Chapter of a Cathedral can exercise an arbitrary ruling over the structure under its
charge which none can gainsay.</p>

<p>In certain cases, doubtless, no great harm may result even from the arbitrary decision
of a small body of men who may or may not have any architectural or archæological
knowledge, but the past bears many glaring instances in which succeeding generations
have had good reason to deplore that in a preceding age a Dean and Chapter has held
undisputed sway and worked its will.</p>

<p>What is needed is that it should be made illegal to add to or alter a cathedral&mdash;in fact,
to do anything beyond ordinary works of upkeep (which do not involve removing stones
or timbers from the structure)&mdash;without the permission of either the advisory board set
up under the Ancient Monuments Act (1913), or, if the church would prefer it, some
advisory board on which the opinion of such societies as the Society of Antiquaries, the
Royal Institute of British Architects, and this Society would be represented equally with
the dignatories of the church. This is a case about which the public should express its
opinion so strongly that a revision of the existing system would inevitably follow.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND</h3>

<p>The Egypt Exploration Fund is arranging a series of lectures to be given in the
rooms of the Royal Society, Burlington House (by the kind permission of the President
and Council). The lectures are primarily for the benefit of its own members and subscribers,
but others will be admitted by tickets, which can be obtained gratis by application
to the Secretary of the Egypt Exploration Fund, 13 Tavistock Square, W.C.1.
The first of these lectures was delivered on Friday, November 21st, at 8.30 p.m. The
chair was taken by Professor Percy G. Newberry, and the lecture, entitled "The
Egyptian Origin of the Alphabet," was given by Mr. T. Eric Peet, who urged the view
that both the North Semitic and South Semitic alphabets, from which together the
Greek alphabet was derived, were derived in their turn from a common source which
was taken, on the acrophonic principle, from Egyptian hieroglyphics. This argument
is largely based on the inscriptions discovered in 1905 at Serâbît-el-Khâdim, in the
Sinai peninsula, by an expedition of the Egypt Exploration Fund. The fund has recently
published a pamphlet dealing with its aims and accomplishments, in which it is pointed
out that Egyptology to-day demands more precise and scientific methods than were
formerly employed, and that, as Egypt is now a protectorate of the British Empire,
the responsibility for safeguarding the records of its history must be accepted by this
country in a fuller measure than heretofore.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE ROYAL NUMISMATIC SOCIETY</h3>

<p>At a meeting of the Royal Numismatic Society on November 20th, Mr. Harold
Mattingly read a paper on "The Republican Origins of the Roman Imperial Coinage."
His main contention was that the Imperial coinage was the direct successor not of the
Republican mint of Rome, but of the coinage of the "Imperator" in the provinces, as
issued from about 83 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> onwards. He traced the history of military coinages under the
Republic and brought evidence to show that it was not till about the time of Sulla that
the "Imperator" himself exercised the right of striking coins. He then showed how out
of this provincial coinage the coinage of the triumvirs naturally developed, and again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
from that coinage of Augustus. Augustus chose to found his system on this basis in
view of the failure of the triumvirs, following in the steps of Julius Cæsar, to establish a
personal coinage at the Republican mint of Rome.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE GEOLOGISTS' ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p>This Association celebrated its sixtieth anniversary on December 7th, 1918, when a
Lecture was delivered by Major Sir Douglas Mawson, in the Architectural Theatre,
University College, Gower Street, W.C.1, on "The Glaciation of Antarctica." During
1919 several important papers have been read, including the Annual Address by the
President, Mr. J. F. N. Green, B.A., F.G.S., on "The Vulcanicity of the Lake
District" and a paper on "Old Age and Extinction in Fossils," by Dr. W. D. Lang.
Three parts of the Proceedings for 1919 have already been published containing a full
report of Dr. Lang's paper, another paper by the same authority on "The Evolution
of Ammonites," and the Presidential Address by the Past-President, Mr. George
Barrow, F.G.S., on "Some Future Work for the Geologists' Association," which is
an interesting and exhaustive study of the post-Eocene deposits of clays, sands and
gravels, older than the River Terrace deposits. The Proceedings also contain accounts
of the excursions made to certain places of geological interest during the year. At
Easter an excursion was conducted to the Bristol District by Professor S. H. Reynolds
and Mr. J. W. Tutcher, and at Whitsuntide the Association visited the Isle of Wight,
under the guidance of Mr. G. W. Colenutt and Mr. R. W. Hooley. Llangollen was
selected as the district for the "Long Excursion" in August, and about forty members
spent a week in the study of the Ordovician, Silurian and Carboniferous systems of
the neighbourhood. Mr. L. J. Wills, M.A., F.G.S., was the Conductor. Excursions
were also made to Sevenoaks, Farnham, Berkhamstead, Codicote (Herts), St. George's
Hill (Weybridge), Box Hill, Headley Heath and Epsom. The first meeting of the
Winter Session was held at University College on November 7th, which was
followed by a conversazione. Many exhibits were made of Fossils and Flint
Implements. Mr. Llewellyn Treacher showed a fine specimen, one of the largest
known, of a flattened, pear-shaped late Chellean implement, 12½ inches long, recently
found in the Maidenhead gravels; a slab of shale studded with Graptolites, from the
Tarannon of Peebleshire, was exhibited by Mr. R. J. A. Eckford; and Mr. J. Francis
showed many fine examples of Jurassic Ammonites and Belemnites, illustrating
chambers, septa, siphuncles and sutures.</p>

<h2 class="b0">DRAMA</h2>

<h3 class="p0">THE POETIC DRAMA</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> question, Is there or is there not a future for poetic drama?&mdash;that is to
say, drama wholly or principally in verse&mdash;is very much like the question, Is
there a future for sport? There are times when everybody seems to be
talking about sport, times when even bookworms begin to play ping-pong;
there are other periods&mdash;one thinks of the novels of George Eliot and
Thackeray&mdash;when the world seems to have been without sport, and in the England of
Jane Austen and the Brontës (contemporaries of Chopin) the sportswoman-composer,
the "horsy" musician revealed in the pages of Miss Ethel Smyth's recent <i>Memoirs</i>
is a figure less conceivable than the Phœnix. But through the darkest of ages sport has
persisted, often as nothing more than the eccentricity of a few cranks, who in the eyes
of the world about them have neglected serious affairs "idly to knock about a ball."</p>

<p>It was characteristic of a utilitarian age that sport and the poetic drama should have
been abandoned together for what the unhappy people of that time, caught in an
unimaginative and rigid scientific theory, thought to be "real life." The spirit of the age
was like the sudden seriousness that seizes a young man when he first realises that he has
great ability and that he must improve the universe. It is a state of mind that rests upon
the conviction that one knows everything, and that what ought to be done is always as
plain as a pikestaff. Once the bottom is knocked out of that omniscient self-confidence
the whole policy and fabric of the time crumbles to pieces, and that is exactly what
happened towards the beginning of the twentieth century when the scientists, like the
decent fellows they are, began to realise that the great clarity and understanding which
had fallen upon the middle of the nineteenth century was in reality a thick fog. But the
old mental attitude persisted well into the present century, and is by no means yet dead.
Owing to the way in which it brought the young intellectuals into practical affairs and
set them studying economics and political policy, chiefly under the influence of that
great spiritual survival of the nineteenth century, Mr. Bernard Shaw&mdash;who happened
by a freak of nature which suggests the comic chuckle of an all-seeing God, to have a
passion for writing plays&mdash;that utilitarian influence continued to pervade the drama
when it had almost faded from the rest of literature. Mr. Shaw's plays are really a sort
of inverted Smiles' <i>Self-Help</i>, and might well be called <i>Plays for Paralysing the Puny
Emotions</i>&mdash;all emotions being puny to Mr. Shaw and Mr. Samuel Smiles compared
with the necessity of getting on&mdash;with the job! With Mr. Smiles the job is one's own
career, with Mr. Shaw the career of the universe&mdash;that is the only difference. The young
intelligentsia of to-day, having almost all of them become materialists under the influence
I have just mentioned, have at last, however, begun to realise that the universe is not
only not going to have the career planned for it by Mr. Shaw or any other group of
thinkers, but also that to plan a career for the universe is like planning an "occupation"
for the Sun. To imagine that in a Daylight Saving Bill you have set the course of the
Sun is to imagine exactly what this social-political school of realists has imagined in its
programme for the universe! Naturally, when one knows what the world ought to be,
and knows one has the power to produce that ideal, one has no time to spare for sport
or for letting one's feelings interfere with one's business. Supermen, like self-made men,
have no time for sentiment. It is here that we find the link&mdash;which might escape the
superficial glance&mdash;between Samuel Smiles and Nietzsche, who has had such an influence
on the Shavian school. It explains, also, why this school was so largely "pacificist"
during the war, for really its intellectual sympathies were with the Prussians, whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
philosophic justification was that they alone had the right conception&mdash;the conception
of an efficient world&mdash;and that it was their task, in fact, their duty, to bring this conception
forcibly into being. Such ideas always bring in their train a morality wholly opposed to
sport and to poetry&mdash;a morality whose essence is the duty of preaching to the unenlightened.
The drama became suddenly useful as a vehicle for intellectual propaganda.</p>

<h4 class="left">The Intellectual Drama</h4>

<p>The young intellectuals began to go to the theatre for the pleasure of hearing their
theories preached at a public unable to answer back or easily to walk out, but dumbly
conscious that it had paid its money to be entertained, and was having its head punched.
It is no wonder that the drama suddenly became so popular with the intelligentsia.
Here was an end to crying in the wilderness, to preaching your world panacea in dull
tracts and essays! They had hit upon a method of getting the man in the street actually
to pay to be instructed in the true doctrine, thinking that he was going to see the drama
of the modern Shakespeare or of one who was "greater than Shakespeare." This, of
course, was hailed as a great dramatic revival, and in so far as it brought the intellectuals
back to the theatre which they had deserted, it was a revival. That is to say, it was a
revival of the intellectuals, not of the theatre. You do not revive the drama by pouring
into it a mass of sociological or philosophical theories, any more than you could be said
to have revived poetry by suddenly writing verses about machines. One of the chief
objects of art is to keep alive in our minds the realisation of the extraordinary depth and
complexity of life. All the greatest dramatists do this; that is why people write books
called <i>The Problem of Hamlet</i>; but the characteristic of this modern school of realists is
not only that they are propagandists&mdash;that is to say, expounders of a certain point of view&mdash;but
that they really believe that they understand the world. With that amazing certainty
which is the hall-mark of the materialistic mind, the mind to which everything presents
a hard, distinct superficies, they have no doubts about anything, and they display a
set of characters who, to use a horrible but expressive phrase, are "all there." These
characters are worthy inhabitants of the world as it appears to their creators. A world
whose stupidity and wrong-headedness is so extraordinarily obvious&mdash;a world in which
it is always so patent what ought to be done, that when one lives in it for the space of
two or three hours during the play's performance one feels like a higher mathematician
with a child's problem out of Euclid. This outrageous simplification and externalising
of life is an intellectual mania fatal to great drama. It is the antithesis of poetry, just as
we have seen war become the antithesis of sport, thereby offending the soundest instincts
of the English people who, though they could find no arguments against the Prussian
intellectual logic, yet felt dumbly but intensely that this simplification of war to something
which shut out all ethics and all play made war damnable and finally unendurable.</p>

<p>We find now the war is over that this drama, whether written to get slums
abolished, to expose prostitution, to draw attention to our prison laws, to expound
socialism, to influence our marriage customs, to kill conventions, to explain strikes, or
merely to be witty at the stupidity of mankind, is no longer in demand. There will
always be a place for comedy, however bitter, savage, and loveless, and all the subjects
named are traditional and excellent for the comic dramatist; but a comedy which is
cold at heart, a comedy in which there is no love, occupies a very insignificant position
in dramatic literature. At this moment the stage is mainly held by the stage play, which
is little more than the bare bones of drama, the actors' device for entertaining an
audience, resembling conjuring and the displays of acrobats. This kind of thing will
always be more plentiful than poetic drama, for the simple reason that it is easier to
obtain and easier to appreciate. Mr. Sutro's <i>The Choice</i>, as well as <i>The Voice from the
Minaret</i>, by Mr. Robert Hichens, and Mr. Arnold Bennett's <i>Sacred and Profane Love</i>
belong to this category. I find them often much more entertaining than the drama of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
ideas which to-day lives on the first ghost of its former self, in such a play as Mr.
Maltby's <i>A Temporary Gentleman</i>, which has naturally won the approval of no less a
person than Mr. William Archer. Mr. Archer has lately had the courage to declare that
he has no use for the poetic drama of the Elizabethans (Shakespeare excepted). This
is not surprising. Mr. Archer has been the champion of the school of modern English
dramatists gathered around Ibsen and Mr. Shaw. It is natural to most Scotsmen to
prefer argument to poetry, and Mr. Archer's animadversions on the Elizabethans only
reveal Mr. Archer's limitations. But he will find that whereas a quarter of a century
ago what he wanted to say was exactly what the young men and women wanted to
hear, now nobody has the slightest interest in discussing social problems on the stage,
and <i>A Doll's House</i> and <i>Man and Superman</i> are more absolutely dead than Tennyson's
<i>Becket</i>. It is amazing to feel the change. I was at Oxford a short time ago, and I found
that the forthcoming performances by the newly-formed Phœnix Society of Webster's
<i>Duchess of Malfi</i> and other Elizabethan plays aroused the same interest and excitement
there as I had felt myself. It is evident that the last wave of Victorian materialism is
rapidly ebbing. The Age of Drains is past. This does not mean that we shall sink back
into the diphtheric state from which the Victorians rescued us; it is simply that after two
or three decades during which the young intellectuals have been annually sucked into a
frenzied enthusiasm for social reform there has come a reaction in which we have
suddenly had quite another vision of life&mdash;a vision far more profound and closer to
reality than the one concentrated in the famous saying: "What is the matter with the
poor is their poverty"&mdash;which has been the social slogan of the last decade.</p>

<h4 class="left">Materialism and Poetry</h4>

<p>It is important to stress this connection of the drama with life, because if we are going
to have, as I believe, poetic drama in the near future, it will be because it is the best
dramatic form for expressing what we feel, and as the demand must come in the first
place from the intellectuals&mdash;since in them alone are the common desires sufficiently
conscious&mdash;it was impossible to get a flowering of poetic drama until the intelligentsia
had recovered from the epidemic of materialism, and had begun to feel the need of
something more satisfying than glittering theories of reforming mankind by pure
economics. The leaders of materialistic thought have always been uncomfortable about
art, and have never been completely honest. In their uneasiness as to its practical value
they have explained it on the ground that art develops and trains the senses&mdash;pictures
train the eye, music trains the ear, drama presumably trains both.</p>

<p>To knock the bottom out of this ridiculous nonsense one has only to ask: What
drama would you give a man in order to train him to pick up pins in the dark? Is it
any wonder that the leaders of this precious substitute for thought could not appreciate
Shakespeare, and is it any wonder that under their influence poetic drama has been
extinct? The deadening influence of this utilitarian materialism has not only been felt
in drama, it has been present in the whole life of the community; but the masses have
been less subject to it than the intelligentsia, that is why the masses on the whole have
stayed away from the intellectual theatre and have patronised the purely sporting,
purely poetic, utterly useless Revue, Musical Comedy, and Farce. And their instinct
has been sound, as sound as it is when they ignore the offer from the same quarter of
a social millennium to be obtained merely by the exercise of logic. But the result has been
a wider cleavage between the people and the intelligentsia than has ever existed before,
and most of the dissatisfaction with the present state of the theatre is due to this fact.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing, but Mr. Herbert Trench, in his fine play <i>Napoleon</i>, which was
produced last month at the Stage Society, and made a strong impression, occasionally
touches on the very idea I have been setting forth. His <i>Napoleon</i> is a type of the
materialistic intellectual who has a routine plan for the universe, and he harps continually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
on "order," as if "order" were something simple, something he had invented
to enable the universe to run smoothly: "Your tide-work taught you poetry. I seek
order," he says to Wickham&mdash;and it sounds like Mr. Shaw or some intellectual dramatist
speaking. I will quote one passage from the central scene&mdash;the scene between Napoleon
and Wickham&mdash;which really puts the case against the intellectuals:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i9">Bubbling with ten thousand springs of life&mdash;clans, nations,<br /></span>

<span class="i9">To be twice Roman'd? Never!<br /></span>
<span class="i9">The grass will lift you as it lifts the stone.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Trench's play is a beginning. If we had&mdash;what is an elementary requirement of
civilisation&mdash;a National Theatre, we would certainly see Mr. Trench's play there, and
I should not be in the least surprised to find it a popular success. The public will never
demand Mr. Trench's play; but then the public never demanded compulsory education,
much as it needed it. I have little doubt but that what the public needs in the theatre
to-day is poetic drama.</p>

<h3>DRAMATIC LITERATURE</h3>

<h4 class="left">BEN JONSON'S EVERY MAN IN HIS HUMOUR. Edited by <span class="smcap">Percy Simpson</span>.
Clarendon Press. 6<i>s.</i></h4>

<p>This is a pioneer volume to a complete edition of Ben Jonson's works, projected by
Professor C. H. Herford and Mr. Percy Simpson, and its excellence is such that it is
fervently to be hoped that we shall not have to wait long for the companion volumes.
When these appear nothing more will be needed, and it will be possible for the ordinary
person to read Jonson without floundering hopelessly among the maze of queries which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
the text at present available raises, and which its paucity of notes does nothing to
explain. Mr. Simpson's admirable introduction deals with the quarto and folio texts,
the date of the play's revision, and the general question of the portraiture of humours.
It contains some excellent criticism of Jonson's revisions, and Mr. Simpson comes to
the conclusion that Jonson began preparing the folio edition in 1612, and his reasons
are, on the whole, convincing. There are sixty pages of notes.</p>

<h4 class="left">SACRED AND PROFANE LOVE. By <span class="smcap">Arnold Bennett</span>. Chatto &amp; Windus. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></h4>

<p>A writer of Mr. Arnold Bennett's eminence and great sagacity would be the last person
to expect us to take this play seriously as a contribution to dramatic literature. Although
it is a play of modern life in the most colloquial prose, it has less reality than the wildest
and most phantasmagoric drama of the Elizabethans. We may not expect Mr. Arnold
Bennett to create for us an imaginative world of his own in which there is an inner
and satisfying truth, but we look to him to mirror in his own peculiarly brilliant fashion
a part of contemporary life with that precision which has so often delighted us. There
is nothing in this play that could not actually have happened, but it is impossible to
believe in it as it is happening. Mr. Bennett has not visualised his people intensely
enough; they are mere puppets borne along by the machinery of the play. This
machinery is from the theatrical point of view effective, and it leaves the creation of
the illusion of life to the flesh and blood of the actors, so that on the stage the play may
have an effect which it can never have when read. The play, of course, has absolutely
nothing to do with sacred or profane love; no hint of the tremendous reality of love in
any sense appears between its covers.</p>

<h2>THE FINE ARTS</h2>

<h3 class="left">Group Making and Group Breaking</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THERE</span> is a distemper prevalent amongst artists of to-day. I refer to the mania
for group forming. We are told by grave scientists that we carry in us the
germs of various diseases; the latent microbe is in our system, apt to be
shaken into active life by some unforeseen circumstance. Artists, it would
appear, have the germ of "group making" inborn in their systems; less
quiescent than other microbes, it awaits the often trivial cause for its activity&mdash;in some
cases too much fame, in other cases the gall of unnoticed mediocrity. Given, then, one or
other of these causes, a series of events is set in motion.</p>

<p>Mr. Maguilp gathers round him various fellow-brushmen of whose work he approves
and, if he is wise and is conversant with the recipe of group making, he will exclude
from the number any one who will be likely to offer serious rivalry to his own position;
he may also luckily procure someone who can make play with the quill as well as the
brush to boost him and his band of worthies with the public. A manifesto is next
issued in which the faithful band begs to be entirely dissociated from any form of
art movement prior to its own, and its members present themselves purged from
original influences, risen like several phœnixes from the fire. They offer, so to say, a firm breakwater to the untiring waves of mediocrity. Good! After a few exhibitions of
their united work the brothers may be considered established and perhaps not unnoticed
by the critics. But now, mark the subtlety of the evil genius which haunts artistic
circles, the group begins to think of self-aggrandisement. "Let us have other members,
let us enlarge, let us, in fact, become (fatal word) representative." But these good men
do not really mean "representative," their exact intentions are rather to increase their
numbers by a process of eclecticism. Alas! The most carefully selected members may
develop different ideas after their election. What trouble might not be averted if we
could see the mental condition, as it were, of every chicken's egg through the shell;
to emphasise this point, however carefully you choose your cabbage there may always
be a slug in it. So, in this little band, which has now become a "group," there are
already forces of unrest, as the papers say. The stages of dissolution from this point are
very rapid: the undesirables multiply, they question the authority of our original
worthies, they manage to introduce other undesirables, and on all sides there is mutual
suspicion and distrust of each other's motives. "I fear he intends to swamp us with the
work of his followers," or "He intends to try and get control of the Group" is whispered
round. Then the rot sets in. One member, for convenience A., refuses to show in the
same room as B., as if the mere presence of the latter's work would corrode the gilt on
his frames. Another disagrees with the gallery, a third has been maliciously hung.
Worse follows, for one of our original friends secedes and forms another group, drawing
others away with him: fresh manifestos are issued, and all original ideas revised, "We
shall burst upon the public," and so on, <i>da capo al fine</i>. The public! What do they
think of it all, does it interest them; do our friends, the artists, fancy that their petty
strife is watched with eager anxiety? Surely to the public this formation and dissolution
of groups must be as puzzling as were the military categories of the war. A layman,
having once become accustomed to one artistic movement, has his attention diverted
to another; on refixing his attention to the first he finds it split up into other formations.
He is as a man watching a parade of soldiers, he sees each battalion form and reform,
wheel and turn, flaunting the while their separate banners as they march, a bewildering
kinetic display. Samuel Butler used to wonder why curates could not be hatched fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
fledged in surplice and gown, without the troublesome prelude of ordination. Could not
artists be allocated at birth in a system of unchangeable groups? Now all this lamentable
state of affairs is largely due to "cliquishness," and in a lesser degree to an inherent
distrust of each other which all artists seem to possess. There is also another contention
which hampers them in their deeper divans. One man regards the exhibition of pictures
as a purely business concern, whereby he hopes to sell his work; another man imagines it
to be an opportunity of displaying, for the education of the uncultured, the results of his
own deep inspiration. The possible difference in their position may be that the former
has to live by what work he sells, the latter has very likely a private income. If, for the
sake of convenience, we introduce our alphabetical friends again, B. will despise A.
for what appear to him to be mercenary feelings, while A. holds B. in contempt for
amateurishness. Of the two I prefer A.'s idea because, once he has carried out his
painting, his next idea (a very sensible one too) is to sell it; while B. affects indifference
and thinks A. has been calculating his possible assets between his brush strokes. This
idea is neither just nor relevant. What can be done for us all? We all want to sell our
pictures; what need is there for pretence, and why are we at the mercy only of a few
members of the "intelligentsia"? After all, I suppose group forming is in a sense a
protective instinct against the dealer, though the results are so inadequate. What then is
the alternative to group making, the remedy for group breaking?</p>

<p>At the back of my mind I have visions for the future. A huge emporium for pictures,
run on business-like lines, and on a scale which will put Mr. Gattie's warehouse scheme
completely in the shade. Here each artist may have his work shown in his turn, not one
or two isolated pictures disseminated among the exhibits of fifty other artists, but each
man's work hung in a group that all may see his development, note his improvement,
and criticise his faults. Why not a Selfridge Emporium for the pictorial arts? "Woodcuts,
Madame, fourth floor." Orders for drawings and paintings and sculpture might be
received, and commissions for decorations undertaken in any possible style. Then
imagine the satisfaction of procuring a Lewis or a Nevinson in the Bargain Basement: and
the sales! "Things <i>were</i> cheap!" as Little Tich says, especially after the failure of the
spring shows.</p>

<h3 class="left">Mr. Nevinson's Exhibition at the Leicester Galleries</h3>

<p>I do not imagine that Sisyphus in Hades ever wantonly let his stone roll down to the
bottom of the hill after his laborious ascent, yet this is what Mr. Nevinson appears to
have done in his passage up the incline of artistic endeavour. The simile is perhaps not
quite applicable because, to be just, his work has seldom shown outward evidence of
great stress: perhaps it were better if it had. He seems to have reached with extraordinary
ease a position in contemporary art which was entitled to our respect. We are
grieved then, rather than angry, to see his descent from that position. If this is his Peace
work then give me his War pictures. I suppose we are all conscious that reconstruction
is very slow in realising our anticipations; the business of changing from war to peace
makes this inevitable, but Mr. Nevinson seems to have rushed, over-hurriedly, from one
to the other. I think he has not considered reconstruction enough, for his outlook at
present is chaotic and rather vulgar. This might be excused on the ground that he was
pulling the public's leg, but the diversion is worn rather threadbare now. There are a
few exceptions in the show, and moreover his colouring remains good, even shows
improvement, and no one can deny his skill. "See," he cries, "how versatile I am. I
have catered for all sorts of people!" Yes, but <i>what</i> sort of people? No, we would speak
more in sorrow than in anger; as Ruskin addressed Millais in his decline&mdash;"If Mr.
Nevinson were to paint nothing but apricots for four years, etc...." But we
feel sure his relapse is only temporary.</p>

<h3 class="left">The London Group</h3>

<p>The eleventh exhibition at the Mansard Gallery does not differ greatly from previous
exhibitions. Probably most people have ceased to expect any great surprise, pleasant or
otherwise, though there may be still a few who mount by lift to the gallery with the feeling
rather of an airman approaching some planetary <i>terra incognita</i>. I was assured the other
day by a candid friend that "your" London Group was as dull as the Academy. This
uncomfortable sort of person must give us a moment's heart-searching, but I think
nevertheless that the London Group still holds its own pretty well amongst art exhibitions
of to-day. With these hopeful feelings uppermost let us examine the works displayed
for our notice. The absence of Charles Ginner's work is to be regretted, and the
rather alarming tendency of some artists to fasten on the characteristics of other artists'
work and mould them rather obviously to their own use is more marked this year than
formerly. I feel sure that several of the members will have to try and throw these
ingenious people off their trail, for it is disconcerting to the highest degree to find the
plagiarist out-doing the original worker at his own job. One would have thought that
Mr. Gertler's apple painting was the last word in that line, but some people appear
to differ and you will find many feeble echoes of these rare fruit and many paintings
also of the chipped corner variety <i>ad nauseam</i>. I do not really know to whom most
sympathy should be extended: to Mr. Gertler for his apples, to Mr. Fry who is very
hotly pursued by his admirers, or to the landscape painters who, I think, might almost
seek the assistance of the patent law. Mr. Bomberg has returned in great force, and his
<i>Barges</i>, No. 31, is indeed an earnest of further excellence; all his paintings have distinction.
Mr. Dickey has presented us with a very fine effort in his <i>Kentish Town</i>, a careful
and refined painting, very beautiful in colour. Mr. Gertler's paintings at the Goupil
Gallery are more interesting than his exhibit here. No. 36, <i>Still Life</i>, by Mr. Coria, is
a painting of note, despite its cold flatness of texture. The exhibition deserves more
detailed criticism than space permits. There is great character in the two paintings of
<i>Caledonian Market</i>, by Therese Lessore, whose exhibition at the Eldar Gallery is now
open. Mr. Duncan Grant's pleasant <i>Farmyard</i> painting should not go unmentioned,
and there is other good work by A. P. Allinson, Mrs. Bashford, Keith Baynes, Ethelbert
White, and Bernard Meninsky.</p>

<h3>ARTISTIC PUBLICATIONS</h3>

<h4 class="left">THE LIFE OF JOHN THOMSON OF DUDDINGSTON. By <span class="smcap">R. W. Napier,
F.R.S.A.</span> Oliver &amp; Boyd. Price 42<i>s.</i></h4>

<p>This is a vast book. Besides the usual foreword and introduction there are six
chapters in which Mr. Napier most anxiously assures us that Thomson's evangelical
labours and lack of artistic training in no way interfere with the exercise of his genius.
This seems a little unnecessary; for we are quite ready to take him on his merits. Then
comes the biography proper, and there are also five indices, a three-part appendix, and six
separate catalogues of his work, besides numerous illustrations, etc. All this immense
labour and care over an artist who I think was not a very significant figure among
British painters. Perhaps he was overshadowed by his contemporaries Turner and
Constable. He was not free, it appears, from the landscape tradition of Claude and
Poussin, which he applied to his own Scottish scenery, and there would also seem to
be a strong influence of Richard Wilson in his work. For all this, I think we may call
him a "great little man," and Mr. Napier's book will be most valuable to the student of
the history of British art.</p>

<h2>MUSIC</h2>

<h3 class="p0">THE BEECHAM OPERA</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> season of opera in English at Covent Garden, which opened at the
beginning of November, offers a programme of unusual interest. <i>Tristan</i>
and <i>Prince Igor</i> are its oldest classics; Mozart, so it is rumoured, is being
held in reserve for a special season of his own. The list contains hardly
a single work that is not either a masterpiece or at least a novelty.
Wagner is represented only by <i>Tristan</i> and <i>Parsifal</i>, Verdi by <i>Otello</i> and <i>Falstaff</i>.
Except for a few Puccini operas on Saturdays, the commonplace popular operas that
are obliged to form the backbone of every continental opera-house's repertory have been
struck out altogether. It is certainly to London's credit that for so uncompromising a
choice the response of the public has been enthusiastic.</p>

<p>As long as Sir Thomas Beecham was fighting the battle of English opera with dogged
persistence and unstinted expenditure of material in the face of apathy and indifference,
and possibly the hostility of vested interests as well, there was a very general feeling
that his courage and high idealism should not be hampered by a too searching criticism
of his performances. The Beecham opera has by now become an established institution,
and it is inevitable, now that it has taken possession of Covent Garden, that it should be
considered in a more impartial spirit. It need not fear comparison with the imported
opera of the summer season. It has made its own high standards; but it follows that
its performances must be judged in general by the standards of its highest individual
achievements.</p>

<p>The present season has so far been something of a disappointment. Several of the
operas to be seen have been given over and over again in the provinces if not in London.
In the case of an absolutely new opera insufficiency of rehearsal may be pardoned; but
it is not a sign of good management when the performance of stock classics is allowed to
become slack and indifferent. Sir Thomas has not been seen very often at the conductor's
desk, and this is the more to be regretted, since he has a most remarkable genius for
pulling through a performance which in other hands would be always trembling on
the verge of disintegration. He has very little sympathy with singers, it seems. He always
tends to regard the orchestra as the main thing, and the singers as mere adjuncts to it,
so that an opera under his beat might easily become a symphony with voices <i>ad libitum</i>
unless, as, for instance, in <i>Trovatore</i>, the composer has understood voices and written
for them in such a way that nothing could ever dominate them. Mr. Goossens follows
in the steps of his master, but with less genius. The performance of <i>Falstaff</i> was instructive
on this problem. Compared with that in the other Verdi operas, the treatment of the
orchestra is so complex as to make it almost symphonic in character. None the less, it
is an opera in which the voices must lead and the band accompany, for if this is not
done the work at once becomes patchy and formless. It requires, in fact, that the singers
should have a strong symphonic sense, should feel themselves all parts of a continuous
vocal <i>ensemble</i> which must be kept going not by the conductor but by their own
co-operative efforts. The orchestra can then accompany, and it must also play its part
with a sense of vocal expression and individual personality. This is the real difficulty of
<i>Falstaff</i>. As it was, the singers had little or no feeling for <i>ensemble</i>. I use the word in a
large sense, meaning not merely the passages where several voices are singing simultaneously,
but all those in which the phrase of one voice is answered directly, or even
at some bars' distance, by another. Mr. Goossens did his best to hold the singers to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
steady beat, but he allowed the orchestra to get very much out of hand. Mr. Percy Pitt
has probably suffered too much from the old conventional Covent Garden routine.
He lets the singers do more or less what they like, and allows the orchestra to play
Wagner and Rimsky-Korsakov as if their music were no more interesting than that of
Bellini and Donizetti. The one salvation of the opera season will be Mr. Albert Coates,
who, even considered merely as a concert conductor, is in a different category from
any of our English conductors. He adds to this a real knowledge and understanding of
the stage, and a personality which has the quality of being able to get the best possible
work out of every single person under his control. That quality is as rare as it is
important.</p>

<p>The stage-management of the season has been, on the whole, good. <i>Falstaff</i> went
with plenty of activity and comic business, if with nothing else. Indeed, there seems to
be a pretty general tendency to romping, which might well be put under restraint.
Romping may pass with some audiences as a substitute for acting, but it can never,
even in English opera, quite take the place of singing. Singers, it must be frankly
admitted, are the weak point of the Beecham company. Covent Garden, partly by its
own acoustic properties, partly by its traditions, which no one who enters the
house can quite forget, shows up vocal deficiency only too severely. Sir Thomas
Beecham possesses only one really first-class operatic artist&mdash;Mr. Frederick
Ranalow. He is a real actor, equally at home in comedy or tragedy, and
always a real singer. It is because he is a real singer, singing all the time, that one
never misses a single word that he says. He is a musician with a large understanding of
the deeper things of music. His Falstaff forms a continuous line; as King Mark he
makes what with most singers is a tedious recitative into a perfect song of rare beauty.
Mr. Frederick Austin is a good second; but whereas Mr. Ranalow is a singer who is also
a musician, Mr. Austin is a musician who also sings. Of the other male singers there is
not much to be said. Some have voices, some can sing, a few can act and throw their
words out. At the best they may in certain cases do remarkably good work in one or two
special parts. Among the ladies the most interesting is Miss Sylvia Nelis. At present she
is little more than a singer. As a singer she goes on steadily improving, in accomplishment
of technique, in diction, and in quality of tone; indeed, there can be little
doubt that if she continues at her present rate of progress she will from about 1970
onwards be annually enrapturing the Albert Hall with <i>Home, Sweet Home</i>. As an actress
she has a good deal to learn, but with her intelligence and undoubted capacity for hard
work there is no reason why she should not develop in this direction. Sir Thomas
Beecham has hitherto confined her almost exclusively to <i>coloratura</i> parts; it would be
well to give her a chance in some part that required bright and vivacious acting rather
than vocal agility. Miss Agnes Nicholls has worked so hard to become an operatic
actress that one regrets bitterly the non-existence of the Beecham company in the
days when she made her first appearance. As it is, she has obviously sung too often in
oratorio. That is the great fault of English singing. It has only two styles (apart from the
ballad concert style)&mdash;oratorio or Gilbert-and-Sullivan. Neither of these will take a
singer through <i>Falstaff</i>. Miss Nicholls did not happen to be in her best vocal form
that evening; but her acting was surprisingly good&mdash;indeed, she was the only character
on the stage, except Mr. Ranalow and sometimes Mr. Percy Heming as Ford, who gave
one a real impression of a Shakespearean character. Miss Rosina Buckman has also
improved, but is very unequal in different styles. As Isolde she sang with a firmer sense
of rhythm than before, and if she did not act very convincingly, at least looked&mdash;in a
black dress with a long white veil and a small crown&mdash;a figure of so queenly a dignity
that it was not surprising to see Mr. Mullings as Tristan keeping a respectful distance
even in the most passionate moments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
Stravinsky's <i>The Nightingale</i> was the nearest approach to a novelty that has yet
appeared. Evidently it had been very inadequately rehearsed. The performance fell far
below the level of the Russian production at Drury Lane in 1914. Miss Nelis as the
Nightingale seemed to be the only singer who was certain of the notes to be sung, and
almost the only singer who was taking the opera seriously. Stravinsky's music is a good
deal less bewildering now than it was five years ago. The first act has a good deal of
beauty: so has the third. The second seemed merely bizarre&mdash;but the performance did
not do the composer much justice. A modern opera of such intricate difficulty ought to
be staged properly and conscientiously or not at all.</p>

<p>There has not yet been time since the end of the war for foreign artists to visit
England in the large numbers which were inevitable five or six years ago. Yet even
though the givers of concerts are at the moment almost exclusively natives of this
country, or foreigners who have definitely made England their home, the scarcity of
concert halls is being very acutely felt. Almost every day there are three concerts at the
Æolian and Wigmore Halls, and when operas begin at 7.45 or earlier, music-lovers
have often to choose between their first act or their dinner. What is to happen when
travelling conditions become easier and the annual foreign invasion reaches its full tide?</p>

<p>A new and very attractive series of Sunday evening concerts has been inaugurated
at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, under the direction of Mr. Arthur Bliss. The
programmes have been generally of a simple and informal character, with a liberal
admixture of seventeenth and eighteenth century music, either for chamber combinations
or for what may be called a chamber orchestra. Designed originally to supply the
artistic needs of the Hammersmith neighbourhood, these concerts have, as a matter of
fact, attracted a great many of the habitual frequenters of the more central concert-rooms.
Mr. Bliss intends to continue his concerts after Christmas, and has announced
for performance several works, both modern and ancient, which are of exceptional
interest.</p>

<p>The Patrons Fund, originally founded by Sir Ernest Palmer, has resumed its concert-giving
activities, but on new and much improved lines. Instead of giving performances
of new English works at public concerts, the programmes of which contained nothing
else but the music of unknown or almost unknown composers, it is proposed to hold a
series of semi-private rehearsals in the hall of the Royal College of Music, at which the
works selected are tried over and properly studied, as far as is possible within the
limits of a single morning. The first of these rehearsals took place on November 13th,
and it was very generally agreed that the new system was an undoubted improvement
on the old. One could not help feeling that the atmosphere was both more friendly and
more genuinely critical. There is undoubtedly a very strong feeling among all lovers of
music in this country that the young British composer deserves far more encouragement
than he gets, although it must be admitted that the young British composer is actually
getting a great deal more than he did twenty or thirty years ago. Rehearsals of this kind
are also of great educational value to the representatives of the Press, for in the struggle
for publicity it is not always the most serious and genuinely original composers who
receive the most attention in this period of violent and natural reaction against the
overcharged emotionalism of the last generation.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDITORIAL NOTES</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> first whole year of peace has ended, and it is natural to throw
a backward look upon its literary production. It is certain that
to the historian it will be a year in which various tendencies
continued to act; it is possible that his eye, in long retrospect,
will observe in it the appearance, the sudden appearance, of new literary
developments and important personalities. But it is, as a rule, only in
long retrospect that such portents are recognised as such; and though we
think that during the year certain movements which have been for some
years in existence have been continued, that there are drifts which are easier
to perceive than to analyse, we cannot persuade ourselves that 1919 added
more than the normal amount to the existing volume of good English
literature. It was, in fact, as a literary year very much like one of the war
years. Perhaps it should properly be regarded itself as a war year. The
principal physical factor which, in our present relation, operated during the
war was the absence on service of the great majority of those young men who
would have been beginning to write. These were, with rare exceptions,
precluded by sheer force of outer circumstances from literary enterprises
of a sustained kind; and, as most of those who survived have left the Army
within the last year, we could scarcely expect so soon as this to find them
producing large and ambitious books. It may also reasonably be argued
that the war-atmosphere still prevails. Peace has come&mdash;and it has not yet
come universally or conclusively&mdash;not suddenly but with the slowness of a
northern dawn. Problems from which even the most self-sufficing mind
cannot escape harass the intellect and weigh on the spirit of the civilised
world. We are not yet in a position to estimate post-war literature, for we
have not yet got post-war literature.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The opinions of intelligent men may differ to some extent as to which
were the most remarkable novels of 1919; that they were very few is, we
conceive, a matter of general agreement. Of the older novelists, Mr. Conrad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
produced in <i>The Arrow of Gold</i> (a work begun long ago and recently
completed) a book which, though not among his masterpieces, was worthy
of him. Mr. Wells, in <i>The Undying Fire</i>, a modernisation of the Book of Job,
wrote an imaginative, an exciting, and an eloquent book. It was much better
shaped and trimmed than has lately been usual with his books, and, for the
first time since he abandoned scientific romance, he concentrated entirely
on doing what he can do better than other people instead of trying to do
what he cannot do. The other elder novelists did nothing that was unexpected
and little that was good; and their successors have not appeared. A Fielding
or a Dickens is a rare product; but we see no young novelists of whom it can
be predicted with any assurance that ten years hence they will occupy places
such as are now occupied by Mr. Wells and Mr. Bennett. It seems certain
that they will not be found amongst that pre-war group whose merits Henry
James examined with such generous consideration, whose defects he indicated
with such delicate diffidence, in a famous article which "betrayed"
rather than stated his alarm, even his pity, for the English Novel. There have
been a few books which have attracted attention by their qualities of construction
and detail or by touches of original genius; but of most of their
authors we could not be sure that they will become even habitual, much less
great, novelists. The book which more than any other appeared to us to be
notable, both for its workmanship and for its imaginative power, was Mr.
Joseph Hergesheimer's <i>Java Head</i>&mdash;and Mr. Hergesheimer is an American.
It was not so good a book (we think <i>Java Head</i> was the earlier written) as
<i>The Three Black Pennys</i>; but the two books are certainly the work of a born
novelist. Miss Romer Wilson, whose <i>Martin Schuler</i> (1918) was a vivid,
vigorous, and original book, published another, and a dull, novel, <i>If All
These Young Men</i>, the subject and setting of which offered less scope to her
peculiar gifts: but she is clearly capable of doing something surprising.
Miss Dane's <i>Legend</i> was a remarkable technical achievement; and Mr.
Cournos's <i>The Mask</i>, Miss Macaulay's fantasia, <i>What Not</i>, and Mr. Brett
Young's <i>The Young Physician</i> were all, in their degrees, notable for a poetic
quality.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Mr. Beerbohm's <i>Seven Men</i> could scarcely be classed with novels. It was
Mr. Beerbohm's best book, than which those who appreciate him could pay
no higher compliment; but Mr. Beerbohm is an artist who stands outside
contemporary movements, literary and other, and one of whose charms
arises from that very detachment. "W. N. P. Barbellion's" <i>Journal of a
Disappointed Man</i> was a full and poignant record which will probably
continue to be read in a narrow circle as Marie Bashkirtseff's memoirs are
read; his posthumous essays, <i>Enjoying Life</i>, are even more convincing
evidence of what their author might have done had he not been stricken by
disease. Amongst works of critical and miscellaneous literature those which
will continue to be enjoyed, or&mdash;in some cases&mdash;used, are Mr. Festing-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>Jones's
<i>Life of Samuel Butler</i>, Professor Gregory-Smith's <i>Ben Jonson</i>, Mr.
Gosse's <i>Diversions of a Man of Letters</i>, the late George Wyndham's <i>Essays
in Romantic Literature</i>, certain books on the old Drama (Swinburne's
<i>The Contemporaries of Shakespeare</i>, and Mr. J. M. Robertson's study of
Hamlet especially), and Miss Ethel Smyth's <i>Impressions that Remained</i>.
This last is one of the best autobiographies that have appeared in our time,
and Dr. Smyth during a long and active life as a composer has been nursing
a rich and racy English style.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The department&mdash;it is difficult in making such a summary to avoid the
language of the catalogue&mdash;in which life has been healthiest has certainly
been poetry. Several of the best and most promising of our living poets
published no book in 1919, but what is incontestably a revival has continued.
Several poets of established reputation have done better work than ever
before. Mr. Hardy has published little, but his <i>Collected Poems</i>, now
published, establish once and for all&mdash;and, old as he is, he belongs as a
poet to this generation&mdash;his right to a place among the great poets. Mr.
Masefield's <i>Reynard the Fox</i> is as certainly his finest book, as Mr. Herbert
Trench's play <i>Napoleon</i>, whatever its defects on the stage, is Mr. Trench's.
There is the largeness about this long and ambitious piece that there was
about some of his earlier and shorter poems, and supremely in his <i>Requiem
of Archangels</i>. Mr. Binyon's <i>The Four Years</i> was a collection of the verses
its author had written concerning the war. It contained several poems made
beautiful by the straightforward utterance of a noble and suffering spirit.
Mr. Yeats's <i>The Wild Swans at Coole</i> it would be affectation to describe as
equal in interest to his earlier volumes, but there were one or two lyrics in
it which would adorn any anthology of English verse; and in Mr. Kipling's
<i>The Years Between</i> there were also flashes of genius. From Mr. Yeats and
Mr. Kipling, however, we do not now expect the unexpected. It is in the
hands of the young that the immediate future of our literature lies. The
most notable volumes by young poets have been (we are tempted to add
Mr. Waley's <i>More Translations from the Chinese</i>) Mr. Brett Young's <i>Poems</i>
and Mr. John Freeman's <i>Memories of Childhood</i>. But in periodicals and
anthologies there has appeared much new and genuine work. A great deal
is to be found in the fourth volume of <i>Georgian Poetry</i>, which was reviewed
in our last number. Mr. de la Mare's latest poems show that his thought is
steadily deepening, whilst he is losing none of that delicacy of music and
beauty of phrase that made his early lyrics as lovely as any in the language;
and both Mr. Sassoon and Mr. Nichols have done work which makes their
future a matter for profound curiosity. Scattered about in other volumes
there have been many single good poems: and it is the characteristic
of a prolific lyrical age that a few good things are written by many men.
We would mention as especially interesting, in that it is one of the few long
successful narrative poems of recent years, Mr. Aldous Huxley's <i>Leda</i>; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
myth was difficult and dangerous, the versification often ungainly, but the
poem contained passages of great strength and beauty. We may add finally
Captain Scott-Moncrieff's fine translation of the <i>Song of Roland</i>.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>We used the term "a lyrical age." Opinions may and do differ as to
the number and quality of good short poems that have been written in the
last ten years, but that the prevalent tendency amongst the most intelligent
young men is to write poems, and short poems, cannot be disputed.
The paucity of good novels, and especially good novels by young writers,
is not entirely to be ascribed to the fact that during the war many of those
who might have written, and may write, good novels were not in a position
to write books at all. The deflation, temporary perhaps, of the Novel has
been proceeding for some years; the absence of even tolerable new novelists
has been too nearly complete to be attributable to the peculiar war conditions.
The novel of "psychology," the novel of minute observation, the
propagandist novel are still produced in quantities; but the best literary
brains are not going into them. The drift towards poetry was noticeable before
the war; the war accelerated it. It is not a mere matter of change of fashion,
of a form being worked out and becoming tedious&mdash;though we do, in fact,
believe that the next revival of the novel will see a new development of the
novel. It is a matter of a change in attitude towards life; a return on the
broader emotions; a desire to acknowledge and praise the things men love
and find beautiful rather than to labour at analysis and at speculation&mdash;not
to mention sophistry. It is mostly lyric poetry that men are writing; and
it is one of the results of the war, which has intensified our awareness of
the old familiar things around us, which were in a sense threatened for all,
and the loss of which was imminently before millions of individuals, that
much of it is poetry of the English landscape and especially of the English
landscape as a historic thing.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Long poetical works, large essays in the poetic drama, are complacently
manufactured by mediocre writers in most literary epochs. But it is
commonly remarked that in this age men of genius, and particularly young
men in whom genius is suspected, are mostly content with "short pieces."
It is rash to theorise about such things, as the wind has a way of blowing
where it listeth. No one can desire that men should systematically force
themselves to literary undertakings which are uncongenial and towards
which they feel no inner impulse. If a man agree with that poet who&mdash;acutely
conscious, it may be, of the nature of his own talent&mdash;said that no
good poem should or could be longer than a couple of hundred lines, he will
serve no useful purpose by manufacturing large patchworks in cold blood.
The presumption that any long work is better than any short one by the
same hand is made by those (we are referring to intelligent men) who do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
not go to poetry for the quintessence of poetry, the thing peculiar to it: it
is from those that we hear most insistently the demand for works on the
large scale, and the complaint that modern writers mostly insist (these are
the stock, if unjust and inaccurate, phrases) on writing sonnets to their
mistresses' eyebrows and carving peach-stones.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The fact remains that by the common consent of mankind lyrics alone&mdash;even
the lyrics of a Heine, a Herrick, or a Burns&mdash;will not give a man rank
with the greatest poetic artists. It may be that in Poe's sense a work of
thousands of lines, which maintains the highest level of poetry, is impossible;
that what Professor Quiller-Couch calls "the Capital Difficulty of
Verse" is insuperable: but this does not invalidate the claim of the <i>Iliad</i> or
<i>Paradise Lost</i> to be considered greater than <i>Lycidas</i> or the songs of Meleager.
That they share in some measure the defects of <i>The Purple Island</i> and
<i>Pharonnida</i> does not prevent <i>The Fairy Queen</i> and <i>Faust</i> being the greatest
of their respective authors' works. From a poet as from another we want
something beyond "jewels five foot long," the loveliest impressions of the
most beautiful particular scenes, reflections of moods, verbal chamber
music, momentary vision, sensibility, song. By the common consent of
mankind the greatest things in the world are those works which, while full
of beautiful details and informed with the poetic spirit, are moulded to a
larger conception and attempt a larger picture of the Universe, of the destiny
of man, or of the moving life of the world. We can, therefore, to some extent
sympathise with those, however broody and disgruntled, who, when they
meet a volume of new and exquisite lyrics, complain that the author has not
written an epic or a tragedy. Is it likely that the present imaginative revival,
assuming it to exist, will produce tragedies or epics, or works on the scale
of such?</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>To us it is difficult to believe that it will not: unless the nervous unrest,
the absence of leisure and of the inclination so to employ leisure, are worse
even than we suppose them to be. We see in much of the work of the younger
men a vigour, a passion, a catholicity of interest, a zest for all life, that
nothing but the most ambitious tasks could satisfy. But when we ask of
what nature such works are likely to be we cannot answer. This one observation
may be made: the demand for long poems is commonly coupled with
a demand for doctrine. The poets are to add to scientific knowledge or to
contribute new notions towards political or moral development: they are to
dogmatise, to enlighten, to direct. Well, poets have done such things. But
not all poets have considered it their business to be religious teachers,
political liberators, or contentious intellectuals. The question: What did
Shakespeare stand for? is disputed to this day. They have read many
theories into him but got very few out of him. That he admired fidelity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
hated cruelty, believed in honour, and loved his country, might be
postulated of him; but the truths he stated there were old truths, and
he stated them only incidentally: he did not write his plays with
the primary object of illustrating principles, above all principles invented
by himself. Milton has been called the poet of Puritanism, and Shelley
the poet of Liberalism, but there is no "ism" for Shakespeare, and a
very, very small one for Keats. The very persons who most insistently
demand "ismatic" poetry are most contemptuous of the didactic,
informative and disputatious parts of the works of the late Lord Tennyson,
who began as a pure Keatsiam poet. <i>Non omnia possumus omnes</i>: and,
over and above this, it is most important to remember that poets, like
other men, are affected by the intellectual conditions of their own times. If
there is a clear tendency some of the poets will be caught up in it. But the
men are very rare who generate their own spiritual revelations in some
secluded corner of an antipathetic world. Wordsworth and Shelley were
what is called "philosophic poets," but their age was the age of Rousseau
and Godwin, of the Libertarian movements that were part cause and part
effect of the French Revolution. If the human spirit is moving in one definite
direction at this moment we can only say that we do not know what that is.
A generation of thorough and often conscienceless scepticism, followed by
a breakdown of civilisation, has produced a mental and moral chaos, a
welter of doubt amid which numbers of the doubters make random and
mutually contradictory affirmations. Something concrete will, if the race is
to live, emerge; but we are not yet in a position to see it. Nor are we, as
mere holders up of the mirror of nature, in a position as yet to see the vast
events in our own material world. For the great philosophic poem we have
probably still many years to wait; for the epic of the German war we may
have a century to wait; for a great drama we may arguably, owing to the
peculiar conditions of the theatre, have to wait for a generally accepted
scale of values which does not at present exist. But the imaginative temper
is abroad, and the next generation may be a great era in English literature.</p>

<h2>LITERARY INTELLIGENCE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> announcement of a new and especially sumptuous edition of the works of
Mr. Thomas Hardy, to be known as the <i>Mellstock</i>, reminds us that there are
other authors to whom the same process might be applied with equal benefit
to themselves and to their readers. The collected edition presents a writer's
career in an orderly shape and in proper perspective: it first permits a sober
and probable judgment to be passed on his achievement. We understand that the works
of Mr. Joseph Conrad will shortly be collected and issued as a whole; and this will
certainly reveal in a definite manner what is now vaguely felt as to his greatness. We
believe also that a definitive issue of the writings of Mr. Max Beerbohm is in contemplation.
It is to be hoped that it will be found possible to include the full list of his
drawings, in some shape not too incompatible with the rest of the volumes. The <i>Collected
Poems</i> of Mr. Walter de la Mare have been announced as in preparation; and this will, we
think, mark a definite stage in the career of a poet whose real value is not yet fully appreciated.
But there are authors, concerning whom no announcement is made, who might be
added to the list with advantage. What might be called "selected-collected" editions of
Mr. Belloc and Mr. Chesterton would very likely secure for these writers a much higher
place in contemporary literature than current opinion is always ready to give them.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Mr. Chesterton will shortly start for the Holy Land. He intends to write a book
about it. The book may, and probably will, be his best, for obvious reasons. It is
commonly remarked even by those who think him one of the greatest natural geniuses
and, at bottom, one of the wisest men of our time that he has never yet written the
books of which he is capable. His best books, such as <i>The Ballad of the White Horse</i> and
<i>A Short History of England</i>, are, for all their fine qualities, too slight to give his
powers full room for display. As a rule, though he cannot be accused of a lack of energy,
he has seemed never to put into a whole book that last effort which is necessary if a work
is to be completely satisfactory; he has bothered too little, content to waste his imaginative
largesse on hastily-written romances and polemical articles. How good <i>The Flying
Inn</i> might have been had a little more trouble been taken with it! In Palestine, away
from politics and journalism, with a new and romantic landscape around him, in the
home of our religion and on the fields of the Crusades, he may provide the last answer
to those who do not see an artist in him.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Mr. Percy Lubbock's edition of Henry James's letters will, it is expected, be published
in the spring. Mr. Edmund Gosse, with the letters as a starting-point, has written his
memories of James. These will be published, in two instalments, in the <span class="smcap">London
Mercury</span>.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>It is five years since James Elroy Flecker died and over three since his <i>Collected Poems</i>
were published. Some of his other literary remains will probably appear this year.
There will be a collected volume of prose studies and critical articles, and another
volume containing his play <i>Hassan</i>, which is awaiting production by Mr. Basil Dean.
Some of those who have read this play say that it is the best tragedy since Shakespeare.
The claim is not so large a one as it may appear at first sight. There are Ford and
Webster. There is <i>Venice Preserved</i> and there is <i>The Cenci</i>, which last is not a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
acting play, though it has magnificent scenes in it and contains sublime poetry. He
who reflects on the history of the English drama since the age of Elizabeth and
James I will be surprised at the paucity of plays of permanent interest, other than
comedies, that have been produced.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Monsieur Yves Delage has presented before the Académie des Sciences a most
interesting note by Monsieur V. Galippe on micro-organisms in paper. It was, of
course, known that paper-making materials of all kinds abounded with these low forms
of life, but it was generally assumed that they were destroyed by the chemicals and
heat employed during the processes of manufacture. Monsieur Galippe's exhaustive
experiments prove that this is not the case, and, moreover, the micro-organisms retain
their vitality even in printing paper, apparently irrespective of the lapse of time. Ovoid
bacilli were found both free in the mass and in the fibres of papers of all ages.</p>

<p>The method of examination employed was the following: The paper was reduced to
fragments and steeped in sterilised distilled water, being frequently stirred. The paper
was then dried and again steeped for several hours in sterilised water saturated with
ether. After once more drying, cultures were taken from the paper.</p>

<p>Eighteenth-century paper thus treated gave positive results within twenty-four hours,
microscopic examination revealing large numbers of rodlike organisms as well as ovoid
diplo-bacilli. A leaf from a printed book of 1496 gave a quantity of large micrococci,
those from the mass being endowed with movement, and those from the fibre remaining
immobile, though preserving the faculty of multiplication. Old Chinese manuscripts and
Egyptian papyri dating back ten centuries gave similar results. It is to be noted that
exposure to light and air does not appear to have the slightest influence on these
organisms.</p>

<p>Although the bibliophile is more particularly concerned in problems relating to fox-marks
and the ravages of the borer insect, nevertheless these experiments are of great
interest. These investigations, if carried further, may well furnish some explanation of
the processes leading to the ageing of paper. From such a vantage-point the technologist
might possibly go forward to discover a palliative against the decay of documents and
printed paper. Pessimists would probably consider this a doubtful blessing, but, on
the whole, it would prove a great boon.</p>

<h2>THE CREATURES</h2>

<p class="center">By WALTER DE LA MARE</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IT</span> was the ebbing light of evening that recalled me out of my story
to a consciousness of my whereabouts. I dropped my little red book to
my knee and glanced out of the narrow and begrimed oblong window.
We were skirting the eastern coast of cliffs, to the very edge of which
a ploughman, stumbling along behind his two great horses, was driving
the last of his dark furrows. In a cleft far down between the rocks a cold
and idle sea was soundlessly laying its frigid garlands of foam. I stared over
the flat stretch of waters, then turned my head, and looked with a kind of
suddenness into the face of my one fellow-traveller.</p>

<p>He had entered the carriage, all but unheeded, yet not altogether unresented,
at the last country station. His features were a little obscure in the
fading daylight that hung between our four narrow walls, but apparently
his eyes had been fixed on my face for some little time.</p>

<p>He narrowed his lids at this unexpected confrontation, jerked back his
head, and cast a glance out of his mirky glass at the bit of greenish-bright
moon that was struggling into its full brilliance above the dun, swelling
uplands.</p>

<p>"It's a queer experience, railway-travelling," he began abruptly, in a low,
almost deprecating voice, drawing his hand across his eyes. "One is cast into
a passing privacy with a fellow-stranger and then is gone." It was as if
he had been patiently awaiting the attention of a chosen listener.</p>

<p>I nodded, looking at him. "<i>That</i> privacy, too," he ejaculated, "all
that!" My eyes turned towards the window again: bare, thorned, black
January hedge, inhospitable salt coast, flat waste of northern water. Our
engine-driver promptly shut off his steam, and we slid almost noiselessly
out of sight of sky and sea into a cutting.</p>

<p>"It's a desolate country," I ventured to remark.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, 'desolate'!" he echoed a little wearily. "But what always
frets me is the way we have of arrogating to ourselves the offices of judge,
jury, and counsel all in one. For my part, I never forget it&mdash;the futility,
the presumption. It <i>leads</i> nowhere. We drive in&mdash;into all this silence, this&mdash;this
'forsakenness,' this dream of a world between her lights of day and
night time. Consciousness!... What itching monkeys men are!"
He recovered himself, swallowed his indignation with an obvious gulp.
"As if," he continued in more chastened tones&mdash;"as if that other gate
were not for ever ajar, into God knows what of peace and mystery." He
stooped forward, lean, darkened, objurgatory. "Don't we <i>make</i> our world?
Isn't <i>that</i> our blessed, our betrayed responsibility?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
I nodded, and ensconced myself, like a dog in straw, in that basest of
all responses to a rare, even if eccentric, candour&mdash;caution.</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, a little weariedly, "that's the indictment. Small
wonder if it will need a trumpet to blare us into that last 'Family Prayers.'
Then perhaps a few solitaries&mdash;just a few&mdash;will creep out of their holes and
fastnesses, and draw mercy from the merciful on the cities of the plain.
The buried talent will shine none the worse for the long, long looming of
its napery spun from dream and desire.</p>

<p>"Years ago&mdash;ten, fifteen, perhaps&mdash;I chanced on the queerest specimen
of this order of the 'talented.' Much the same country, too. This"&mdash;he
swept his glance out over a now invisible sea&mdash;"this is a kind of dwarf
replica of it. More naked, smoother, more sudden and precipitous, more
'forsaken,' moody. Alone! The trees are shorn there, as if with monstrous
shears, by the winter gales. The air's salt. It is a country of stones and
emerald meadows, of green, meandering, aimless lanes, of farms set in their
clifts and valleys like rough time-bedimmed jewels, as if by some angel of
humanity, wandering between dark and daybreak.</p>

<p>"I was younger then&mdash;in body: the youth of the mind is for men of an
age&mdash;yours, maybe, and mine. Even then, even at that, I was sickened of
crowds, of that unimaginable London&mdash;swarming wilderness of mankind
in which a poor lost thirsty dog from Otherwhere tastes first the full meaning
of that idle word 'forsaken.' 'Forsaken by whom?' is the question I
ask myself now. Visitors to my particular paradise were few then&mdash;as if, my
dear sir, we were not all of us visitors, visitants, revenants, on earth, panting
for time in which to tell and share our secrets, roving in search of the marks
that shall prove our quest not vain, not unprecedented, not a treachery.
But let that be.</p>

<p>"I would start off morning after morning, bread and cheese in pocket,
from the bare old house I lodged in, bound for that unforeseen nowhere
for which the heart, the fantasy aches. Lingering hot noondays would
find me stretched in a state half-comatose, yet vigilant, on the close-flowered
turf of the fields or cliffs, on the sun-baked sands and rocks,
soaking in the scene and life around me like some pilgrim chameleon. It
was in hope to lose my way that I would set out. How shall a man find
his way unless he lose it? Now and then I succeeded. That country is
large, and its land and sea marks easily cheat the stranger. I was still of an
age, you see, when my 'small door' was ajar, and I planted a solid foot to
keep it from shutting. But how could I know what I was after? One just
shakes the tree of life, and the rare fruits come tumbling down, to rot
for the most part in the lush grasses.</p>

<p>"What was most haunting and provocative in that far-away country
was its fleeting resemblance to the country of dream. You stand, you sit,
or lie prone on its bud-starred heights, and look down; the green, dispersed,
treeless landscape spreads beneath you, with its hollows and mounded
slopes, clustering farmstead, and scatter of village, all motionless under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
the vast wash of sun and blue, like the drop-scene of some enchanted playhouse
centuries old. So, too, the visionary bird-haunted headlands, veiled
faintly in a mist of unreality above their broken stones and the enormous
saucer of the sea.</p>

<p>"You cannot guess there what you may not chance upon, or whom.
Bells clash, boom, and quarrel hollowly on the edge of darkness in those
breakers. Voices waver across the fainter winds. The birds cry in a tongue
unknown yet not unfamiliar. The sky is the hawks' and the stars'. <i>There</i> one
is on the edge of life, of the unforeseen, whereas our cities&mdash;are not our
desiccated jaded minds ever continually pressing and edging further and
further away from freedom, the vast unknown, the infinite presence, picking
a fool's journey from sensual fact to fact at the tail of that he-ass called
Reason? I suggest that in that solitude the spirit within us realises that it
treads the outskirts of a region long since called the Imagination. I
assert we have strayed, and in our blindness abandoned&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>My stranger paused in his frenzy, glanced out at me from his obscure
corner as if he had intended to stun, astonish me with some violent heresy.
We puffed out slowly, laboriously, from a "Halt" at which in the gathering
dark and moonshine we had for some while been at a standstill. Never was
wedding-guest more desperately at the mercy of ancient mariner.</p>

<p>"Well, one day," he went on, lifting his voice a little to master the
resounding heart-beats of our steam-engine&mdash;"one late afternoon, in my
goal-less wanderings, I had climbed to the summit of a steep grass-grown
cart-track, winding up dustily between dense, untended hedges. Even then I
might have missed the house to which it led, for, hair-pin fashion, the track
here abruptly turned back on itself, and only a far fainter footpath led on over
the hill-crest. I might, I say, have missed the house and&mdash;and its inmates,
if I had not heard the musical sound of what seemed like the twangling
of a harp. This thin-drawn, sweet, tuneless warbling welled over the close
green grass of the height as if out of space. Truth cannot say whether
it was of that air or of my own fantasy. Nor did I ever discover what
instrument, whether of man or Ariel, had released a strain so pure and yet
so bodiless.</p>

<p>"I pushed on and found myself in command of a gorse-strewn height,
a stretch of country that lay a few hundred paces across the steep and
sudden valley in between. In a V-shaped entry to the left, and sunwards,
lay an azure and lazy tongue of the sea. And as my eye slid softly thence
and upwards and along the sharp, green horizon line against the glass-clear
turquoise of space, it caught the flinty glitter of a square chimney.
I pushed on, and presently found myself at the gate of a farmyard.</p>

<p>"There was but one straw-mow upon its staddles. A few fowls were
sunning themselves in their dust-baths. White and pied doves preened
and cooed on the roof of an outbuilding as golden with its lichens as if the
western sun had scattered its dust for centuries upon the large slate slabs.
Just that life and the whispering of the wind, nothing more. Yet even at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
one swift glimpse I seemed to have trespassed upon a peace that had endured
for ages; to have crossed the viewless border that divides time from eternity.
I leaned, resting, over the gate, and could have remained there for hours,
lapsing ever more profoundly into the blessed quietude that had stolen
over my thoughts.</p>

<p>"A bent-up woman appeared at the dark entry of a stone shed opposite
to me, and, shading her eyes, paused in prolonged scrutiny of the stranger.
At that I entered the gate and, explaining that I had lost my way and was
tired and thirsty, asked for some milk. She made no reply, but after peering
up at me, with something between suspicion and apprehension on her
weather-beaten old face, led me towards the house which lay to the left
on the slope of the valley, hidden from me till then by plumy bushes of
tamarisk.</p>

<p>"It was a low grave house, grey-chimneyed, its stone walls traversed
by a deep shadow cast by the declining sun, its dark windows rounded and
uncurtained, its door wide open to the porch. She entered the house, and
I paused upon the threshold. A deep unmoving quiet lay within, like that
of water in a cave renewed by the tide. Above a table hung a wreath of
wild flowers. To the right was a heavy oak settle upon the flags. A beam of
sunlight pierced the air of the staircase from an upper window.</p>

<p>"Presently a dark long-faced gaunt man appeared from within, contemplating
me, as he advanced, out of eyes that seemed not so much to fix
the intruder as to encircle his image, as the sea contains the distant speck
of a ship on its wide blue bosom of water. They might have been the eyes
of the blind; the windows of a house in dream to which the inmate must
make something of a pilgrimage to look out upon actuality. Then he smiled,
and the long, dark features, melancholy yet serene, took light upon them, as
might a bluff of rock beneath a thin passing wash of sunshine. With a
gesture he welcomed me into the large, dark-flagged kitchen, cool as a cellar,
airy as a belfry, its sweet air traversed by a long oblong of light out of
the west.</p>

<p>"The wide shelves of the painted dresser were laden with crockery. A
wreath of freshly-gathered flowers hung over the chimney-piece. As we
entered, a twittering cloud of small birds, robins, hedge-sparrows, chaffinches
fluttered up a few inches from floor and sill and window-seat, and once
more, with tiny starry-dark eyes observing me, soundlessly alighted.</p>

<p>"I could hear the infinitesimal <i>tic-tac</i> of their tiny claws upon the slate.
My gaze drifted out of the window into the garden beyond, a cavern of
clearer crystal and colour than that which astounded the eyes of young
Aladdin. Apart from the twisted garland of wild flowers, the shining metal
of range and copper candlestick, and the bright-scoured crockery, there was
no adornment in the room except a rough frame, hanging from a nail in
the wall, and enclosing what appeared to be a faint patterned fragment of blue
silk or fine linen. The chairs and table were old and heavy. A low light
warbling, an occasional <i>skirr</i> of wing, a haze-like drone of bee and fly&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>these
were the only sounds that edged a quiet intensified in its profundity
by the remote stirrings of the sea.</p>

<p>"The house was stilled as by a charm, yet thought within me asked no
questions; speculation was asleep in its kennel. I sat down to the milk
and bread, the honey and fruit which the old woman laid out upon the
table, and her master seated himself opposite to me, now in a low sibilant
whisper&mdash;a tongue which they seemed to understand&mdash;addressing himself
to the birds, and now, as if with an effort, raising those strange grey-green
eyes of his to bestow a quiet remark upon me. He asked, rather in courtesy
than with any active interest, a few questions, referring to the world, its
business and transports&mdash;<i>our</i> beautiful world&mdash;as an astronomer in the
small hours might murmur a few words to the chance-sent guest of his
solitude concerning the secrets of Uranus or Saturn. There is another,
an inexplorable side to the moon. Yet he said enough for me to gather
that he, too, was of that small tribe of the aloof and wild to which our
cracked old word 'forsaken' might be applied, hermits, clay-matted fakirs,
and such-like, the snowy birds that play and cry amid mid-oceanic surges,
the living of an oasis of the wilderness, which share a reality only distantly
dreamed of by the time-driven, thought-corroded congregations of man.</p>

<p>"Yet so narrow and hazardous I somehow realised was the brink of
fellow-being (shall I call it?) which we shared, he and I, that again and
again fantasy within me seemed to hover over that precipice Night knows
as fear. It was he, it seemed, with that still embracive contemplation of
his, with that far-away yet reassuring smile, that kept my poise, my balance.
'No,' some voice within him seemed to utter, 'you are safe; the bounds
are fixed; though hallucination chaunt its decoy, you shall not irretrievably
pass over. Eat and drink, and presently return to "life."' And I listened,
and, like that of a drowsy child in its cradle, my consciousness sank deeper
and deeper, stilled, pacified, into the dream amid which, as it seemed,
this soundless house of stone now reared its walls.</p>

<p>"I had all but finished my meal when I heard footsteps approaching on
the flags without. The murmur of other voices, distinguishably shrill yet
guttural, even at a distance, and in spite of the dense stones and beams
of the house which had blunted their timbre, had already reached me.
Now the feet halted. I turned my head&mdash;cautiously, even perhaps apprehensively&mdash;and
confronted two figures in the doorway.</p>

<p>"I cannot now guess the age of my entertainer. These children&mdash;for
children they were in face and gesture and effect, though as to form and
stature apparently in their last teens&mdash;these children were far more
problematical. I say 'form and stature,' yet obviously they were dwarfish.
Their heads were sunken between their shoulders, their hair thick, their
eyes disconcertingly deep-set. They were ungainly, their features peculiarly
irregular, as if two races from the ends of the earth had in them intermingled
their blood and strangeness, as if rather animal and angel had
connived in their creation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
"But if some inward light lay on the still eyes, on the gaunt, sorrowful,
quixotic countenance that now was fully and intensely bent on mine,
emphatically that light was theirs also. He spoke to them, they answered&mdash;in
English, my own language, without a doubt: but an English slurred,
broken, and unintelligible to me, yet clear as bell, haunting, penetrating,
pining as voice of nix or siren. My ears drank in the sound as an Arab
parched with desert sand falls on his dried belly and gulps in mouthfuls of
crystal water. The birds hopped nearer, as if beneath the rod of an
enchanter. A sweet continuous clamour arose from their small throats.
The exquisite colours of plume and bosom burned, greened, melted in the
level sun-ray, in the darker air beyond.</p>

<p>"A kind of mournful gaiety, a lamentable felicity, such as rings in the
cadences of an old folk-song, welled into my heart. I was come back to the
borders of Eden, bowed and outwearied, gazing out of dream into dream,
homesick, 'forsaken.'</p>

<p>"Well, years have gone by," muttered my fellow-traveller deprecatingly,
"but I have not forgotten that Eden's primeval trees and shade.</p>

<p>"They led me out, these bizarre companions, a he and a she, if I may
put it as crudely as my apprehension of them put it to me then. Through
a broad door they conducted me&mdash;if one who leads may be said to be
conducted&mdash;into their garden. Garden! A full mile long, between undiscerned
walls, it sloped and narrowed towards a sea at whose dark unfoamed
blue, even at this distance, my eyes dazzled. Yet how can one call that a
garden which reveals no ghost of a sign of human arrangement, of human
slavery, of spade or hoe?</p>

<p>"Great boulders shouldered up, tessellated, embossed, powdered with
a thousand various mosses and lichens, between a flowering greenery
of weeds. Wind-stunted, clear-emerald, lichen-tufted trees smoothed and
crisped the inflowing airs of the ocean with their leaves and spines, sibilating
a thin scarce-audible music. Scanty, rank, and uncultivated fruits hung
close their vivid-coloured cheeks to the gnarled branches. It was the
harbourage of birds, the small embowering parlour of their house of life,
under an evening sky, pure and lustrous as a water-drop. It cried
'Hospital' to the wanderers of the universe.</p>

<p>"As I look back in ever-thinning, nebulous remembrance, on my two
companions, hear their voices gutturally sweet and shrill, catch again their
being, so to speak, I realise that there was a kind of Orientalism in their
effect. Their instant courtesy was not Western, the smiles that greeted me,
whenever I turned my head to look back at them, were infinitely friendly,
yet infinitely remote. So ungainly, so far from our notions of beauty and
symmetry were their bodies and faces, those heads thrust heavily between
their shoulders, their disproportioned yet graceful arms and hands, that
the children in some of our English villages might be moved to stone them,
while their elders looked on and laughed.</p>

<p>"Dusk was drawing near; soon night would come. The colours of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
sunset, sucking its extremest dye from every leaf and blade and petal,
touched my consciousness even then with a vague fleeting alarm.</p>

<p>"I remember I asked these strange and happy beings, repeating my
question twice or thrice, as we neared the surfy entry of the valley upon
whose sands a tiny stream emptied its fresh waters&mdash;I asked them if it was
they who had planted this multitude of flowers, many of a kind utterly
unknown to me and alien to a country inexhaustibly rich. 'We wait; we
wait!' I think they cried. And it was as if their cry woke echo from the
green-walled valleys of the mind into which I had strayed. Shall I confess
that tears came into my eyes as I gazed hungrily around me on the harvest
of their patience?</p>

<p>"Never was actuality so close to dream. It was not only an unknown
country, slipped in between these placid hills, upon which I had chanced
in my ramblings. I had entered for a few brief moments a strange region
of consciousness. I was treading, thus accompanied, amid a world of welcoming
and fearless life&mdash;oh, friendly to me!&mdash;the paths of man's imagination,
the kingdom from which thought and curiosity, vexed scrutiny and
lust&mdash;a lust it may be for nothing more impious than the actual&mdash;had prehistorically
proved the insensate means of his banishment. 'Reality,'
'Consciousness': had he for 'the time being' unwittingly, unhappily
missed his way? Would he be led back at length to that garden wherein
cockatrice and basilisk bask, harmlessly, at peace?</p>

<p>"I speculate now. In that queer, yes, and possibly sinister, company,
sinister only because it was alien to me, I did not speculate. In their garden,
the familiar was become the strange&mdash;'the strange' that lurks in the inmost
heart, unburdens its riches in trance, flings its light and gilding upon
love, gives heavenly savour to the intemperate bowl of passion, and is the
secret of our incommunicable pity. What is yet queerer, these beings were
evidently glad of my company. They stumped after me (as might yellow men
after some Occidental quadruped never before seen) in merry collusion of
nods and wreathed smiles at this perhaps unprecedented intrusion.</p>

<p>"I stood for a moment looking out over the placid surface of the sea. A
ship in sail hung phantom-like on the horizon. I pined to call my discovery
to its seamen. The tide gushed, broke, spent itself on the bare boulders.
I was suddenly cold and alone, and gladly turned back into the garden,
my companions instinctively separating to let me pass between them. I
breathed in the rare, almost exotic heat, the tenuous, honeyed, almond-laden
air of its flowers and birds&mdash;gull, mandrake, plover, wagtail, finch,
robin, which as I half-angrily, half-sadly realised fluttered up in momentary
dismay only at <i>my</i> presence, the embodied spectre of their enemy, man.
Man? Then who were these?...</p>

<p>"I lost again a way lost early that morning, as I trudged inland at night.
The dark came, warm and starry. I was tired, dejected, exhausted beyond
words. That night I slept in a barn and was awakened soon after daybreak
by the crowing of cocks. I went out, dazed and blinking into the sunlight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
bathed face and hands in a brook near by, and came to a village before a
soul was stirring. So I sat under a thrift-cushioned, thorn-crowned wall in a
meadow, and once more drowsed off and fell asleep. When again I awoke, it
was ten o'clock. The church clock in its tower knelled out its strokes, and
I went into an inn for food.</p>

<p>"A corpulent, blonde woman, kindly and hospitable, with a face comfortably
resembling her own sow's, that yuffed and nosed in at the open
door as I sat on my stool, served me with what I called for. I described&mdash;not
without some vanishing shame, as if it were a treachery&mdash;my farm, its
whereabouts.</p>

<p>"Her small blue eyes 'pigged' at me with a fleeting expression which I
failed to translate. The name of the farm, it appeared, was Trevarras. 'And
did you see any of the Creatures?' she asked me in a voice not entirely her
own. 'The Creatures'! I sat back for an instant and stared at her; then
realised that Creature was the name of my host, and Maria and Christus
(though here her dialect may have deceived me) the names of my two
gardeners. She spun an absurd story, so far as I could tack it together and
make it coherent. Superstitious stuff about this man who had wandered in
upon the shocked and curious inhabitants of the district and made his home
at Trevarras&mdash;a stranger and pilgrim, a 'foreigner,' it seemed, of few
words, dubious manners, and both uninformative.</p>

<p>"Then there was something (she placed her two fat hands, one of them
wedding-ringed, on the zinc of the bar-counter, and peered over at me,
as if I were a delectable 'wash'), then there was something about a
woman 'from the sea.' In a 'blue gown,' and either dumb, inarticulate,
or mistress of only a foreign tongue. She must have lived in sin, moreover,
those pig's eyes seemed to yearn, since the children were 'simple,'
'naturals'&mdash;as God intends in such matters. It was useless. One's stomach
may sometimes reject the cold sanative aerated water of 'the next morning,'
and my ridiculous intoxication had left me dry but not yet quite sober.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, this she told me, that my blue woman, as fair as flax, had died
and was buried in the neighbouring churchyard (the nearest to, though
miles distant from, Trevarras). She repeatedly assured me, as if I might
otherwise doubt so sophisticated a fact, that I should find her grave there,
her 'stone.'</p>

<p>"So indeed I did&mdash;far away from the elect, and in a shade-ridden northwest
corner of the sleepy, cropless acre: a slab, scarcely rounded, of
granite, with but a name bitten out of the dark rough surface, '<i>Femina
Creature</i>.'"</p>

<h2>ON BLAKE AS A PROPHET</h2>

<p class="center">By A. CLUTTON-BROCK</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">MEN</span> have always lost their heads over prophets, and prophets have
often lost their heads over themselves. The word itself expresses
a common misunderstanding. The prophet is not a tipster&mdash;if
he has any power of foretelling, it is only a part of his
wisdom; he is a man in whom the universal man speaks, not the lower or
generic or animal universal, but that higher universal to which individuals
and societies sometimes attain. You may, of course, disbelieve in it altogether,
in which case the prophet is to you merely one who talks nonsense; but he
himself is aware of it when it speaks in him, and it makes him vehement,
hasty, impatient both of his own medium of language and of all opposition
or failure to understand. It is to him an absolute which forces him to utter
that, true always and everywhere; but he has to express it in human language,
a medium relative to human wants and human conditions. So his expression
is always imperfect and cannot be understood except with the goodwill of
the hearer. This goodwill he demands, not from egotism, but because he
is uttering the universal, and the refusal of it exasperates him. I have piped
to you and you have not danced&mdash;is always the cry of the prophet. Argument
he hates and the dialectic of Dons, because his universal is not to be proved,
its convincing power is in itself. It is the truth which, like beauty, is believed
when seen; and, if you will not believe it, that is because you refuse to see or
hear it. You are like the deaf adder that stoppeth its ears, and you are refusing
to see your own truth as well as his; you are refusing to find yourself in the
universal. Who are you, says Whitman, that wanted a book to encourage you
in your nonsense? Your nonsense is your private opposition to the universal,
the obstacle which you set up in yourself to your own wisdom and happiness;
and with this the prophet has no patience. He will make no terms with it; he
will not attempt a worldly lucidity or even the contrivance of the artist. It
is not he who speaks but the universal that speaks in him, often beautifully
but careless even of beauty, finding what human words it can; and men
must not look this gift-horse in the mouth, must not criticise him, for
it is not he who speaks as an individual but&mdash;my father that speaketh
in me.</p>

<p>So many men, whether they stone the prophet or accept him, misunderstand
him always; after they have stoned or ignored him, they worship him
as a magician. In the past he was to them one who foretold the future; now
they find an equal value in all that he says and does. Any words of his have
a biblical authority, and he is the one genuine prophet, compared with
whom all others are impostors. They do not know that the chief reason for
believing prophets is that they all say the same thing, that this universal of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
theirs is a real universal, <i>quod semper</i>, <i>quod ubique</i>, <i>quod ab omnibus</i>. When
they assert that their particular prophet has a monopoly of the truth, they
are depriving him of his chief authority, turning his universal into a particular;
and this they do because they will not be at the pains to seek the
universal in his works. It must be recognised by its own quality, and every
man must recognise it for himself; but they, flinching from the effort of
recognition, seek a gospel made authentic by the name of its author; the
prophet has said it and it must be true.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the prophet himself often shares this infirmity and believes
that he is always a prophet; he becomes a disciple of himself, and sets
himself above criticism, not from mere egotism and conceit so much as
because he too flinches from the task of discerning his own universal.
The prophetic vehemence becomes a habit with him; and he despises the
artist's patience and contrivance; he may even believe that he is a prophet
because he himself does not clearly understand what he says; he may mistake
the automatism, which lies in wait for everyone who constantly practises
any art, for the universal speaking in him and imperiously snatching at
language to express itself.</p>

<p>Now Blake was artist as well as prophet, a great artist in two arts; but
everything conspired to make him confuse the functions of artist and prophet,
which indeed are easily confused. A man is helped to understand himself
by the understanding of others; and Blake had no one to understand him,
as artist or as prophet. His masters were in the past; his own achievements
belonged to the future; he lacked that contemporary education which is best
worth having. There was no one even for him to talk to, but only a few
listeners who were not sure that he was sane. As artist, he was a prophet in
the literal sense; he did what men were going to do as well as what they had
done long ago. Naturally he believed that, as artist, he was always right,
while Reynolds and the other popular ones of his own time were always
wrong. He had a blood-feud with them, and was in love with his own work;
he believed that the universal, which sometimes possessed him, possessed
him always, because his writing and his drawing were unlike those of other
men of his time. So he made a myth about himself to express his lack of
criticism, namely, that his works were dictated to him by an angel, they were
not his, and it was not his business to improve or judge them.</p>

<p>In his own time he was neglected; but now he is subject to the other kind
of misunderstanding. He has disciples who are as uncritical of his works as
he was, for whom he is always prophet, never artist, or rather an infallible
artist because a prophet. They tell us that, if we enjoy his poems as poems
or his pictures as pictures, we have not found the key to them. With the key
of his symbolism we can enter a sanctuary beyond beauty in which the
secrets of the universe are revealed. But they cannot tell us what these secrets
are any more than Blake could; and I would rather believe that he told us all
he could by the methods proper to a writer, and that the faults of the artist
are not the virtues of the prophet; that where in verse that begins beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
he becomes incoherent, uses catchwords not to be understood except by
reference to other writings and often not then, he is himself confusing the
artist with the prophet and making the mistake of his disciples.</p>

<p>If you are in danger of believing in the magic of Blake, of treating him
as our pious grandparents treated the Hebrew prophets, you may recover
your senses by considering his other art; for in that the difference between
his artistic failures and successes is plain. I myself believe that Blake was the
greatest master of design among all modern artists, that for the shaping
imagination you must go back to Tintoret to find his equal. But, whereas in
poetry he freed himself easily from all influences foreign to his own character
and genius, in his other art he was free only intermittently and blindly.
There are two kinds of drawing which I will call rhythmical and constructional,
although, of course, there is rhythm in all good constructional drawing
and some construction in all good rhythmical drawing. But the difference is
one of kind, it is the difference between Cimabue and Michelangelo. Cimabue
expresses himself mainly in rhythm to which the descriptive shapes of things
are subordinate&mdash;it is enough if you can recognise them. Michelangelo's
line itself constructs, it tells us how things are made and insists upon their
functions. It is the line natural to an age eager for consecutive thought;
it is, as it were, an arguing line. Now, Blake was by nature, by conviction, by
habit, a rhythmical draughtsman, and all his best work is rhythmical rather
than constructive; he is not arguing with us, he is telling us, in line as in
words. It is enough for him if we can recognise his shapes for what they
are; he expresses his real content in the sway of lines, as if it were a dance
or a gesture, and he is most at his ease when his shapes are like flames blown
in the wind, almost transformed by his own emotion. And yet he was not
often at his ease in drawing, for all his life he was, like Fuseli, haunted by the
ghost of Michelangelo, whose actual works he had never seen. Even he was
subdued by the prestige of a master whose method was poison to his genius.
In poetry he could be inspired by the past art of his own country, and
in his earliest poems alone does he speak for a few words, in the language of
his time. "And Phœbus fired my vocal rage"; but his drawings are infested
by formulæ taken second-hand from Michelangelo. It is only now and then,
in the decorations to books which he printed himself, in the magnificent
woodcuts for Thornton's Pastorals, in some of the Dante illustrations, that
he quite frees himself from a pretence of constructional drawing. If you
would excel in that, you must study the particular fact passionately, you
must get your construction from the fact, not from your own mind; but
Blake, like so many imitators of Michelangelo, did not study the
fact; he gives us a pretence of constructional drawing in formulæ often
struggling to be rhythmical and failing because they are formulæ of construction.
There he is like St. Paul, who sometimes spoils matter that should
be prophetic with a pretence of Greek dialectic, who makes a bad argument
for the Resurrection out of an image. Even in his most famous design, the
Morning Stars of the Book of Job, the rhythm of the wings and garments is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
cramped by the drawing, anatomical without freshness, of the bodies.
Compare this with the last drawing but one of the series, where rhythm is
master of all, and you will see how Blake, even in his great maturity, only
practised his true method by accident, and when there was no association to
mislead him; the nude was a snare to him, and seldom could he find a method
of his own for it. Often he was merely an inferior Fuseli; and bits of Fuseli
obtrude even in his finer works. Nothing could be more tiresome than the
drawing of some of his faces, and no one could for a moment suppose that
there was any prophetic infallibility in these failures; they are as dull as late
Roman sculpture or the efforts of Reynolds in the grand style.</p>

<p>But, if Blake is not infallible as a draughtsman, he is not infallible at all;
for he himself would sometimes claim infallibility in all his works; by the
common infirmity of prophets, when they cease to be prophetic, he assumed
a status different from that of the artist, and so was induced to set down
whatever came into his mind, as if an angel were dictating to him or he had
command of the pencil of the Holy Ghost. But the artist and the prophet are
both what they are by effort not by status; if they rely on status they become
bores or charlatans; and that is true of all human beings, of Blake no less
than of Habakkuk. If ever he seems to have written nonsense, then we must
take it to be nonsense until we find sense in it; we must pay no heed if we
are told that the seeming nonsense is symbolism.</p>

<p>Even in his finest poems we must not assume a clearer purpose than we
find. Take, for instance, the third verse of the Tiger:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And what shoulder, and what art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could twist the sinews of thy heart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when thy heart began to beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What dread hand? and what dread feet?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">We may persuade ourselves that there is some peculiar virtue in the two
broken questions of the last line; but the original draft of the <span class="locked">poem<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span>
proves that Blake did not at first mean them to be broken questions at all.
They were continued in the next stanza:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9" href="#FNanchor_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> <i>The original draft is given in the excellent Oxford edition of Blake's </i>Poetical Works<i>,
published by Mr. Milford, and edited by Mr. John Sampson, at the price, in 1913, of 1s. 6d.
net. In spite of the price, it is the most complete edition of the poems, and contains all the
shorter Prophetic Books, including the French Revolution, with extracts from the longer ones.</i></p></div>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Could fetch it from the furnace deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in thy horrid ribs dare steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the well of sanguine woe, etc.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Blake seeing, what was obvious, that this did not promise well and was
leading nowhere, gave it up and changed the punctuation of the preceding
stanza which had run simply&mdash;"What dread hand and what dread feet"&mdash;to
its present form, so as to finish off the stanza to the eye, if not
to the mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
It is a masterful way out of a difficulty, but it takes the risk that we shall
ask what the dread hand and feet are there to do? The original draft tells us&mdash;to
fetch the tiger's heart from the furnace deep; but in the poem as we know
it we may guess for ourselves, and there is no answer. This is not the dark
sublimity of the prophet, but the wilfulness of the poet, who, having hit upon
a fine sounding line, prefers it to sense. (There is also another reading which
may come from Blake himself&mdash;"What dread hand forged thy dread feet?"
It is not "prophetic," but it does make sense.)</p>

<p>It does not matter much, for the rhythm of the poem carries one through
obscurities of detail; but the broken questions are not an added beauty or
sublimity, they are merely Blake's way out of a difficulty that may beset
any poet.</p>

<p>So I come, gradually and cautiously, to the Prophetic Books themselves,
and to my contention that they too are to be judged, like the works of the
Hebrew Prophets, as literature, since they were written for men to read.
We must make a reasonable allowance for all mystics; they try to say what
is very hard to say, what they have seen as in a glass darkly. If you think them
worth reading at all, you believe that they are concerned with a reality men
do not perceive naturally and immediately with the senses, a reality that we
are aware of, if at all, only by hints and whispers. There are no commonly
accepted sense-data for this reality, upon which we can reason as we can
reason about the movements of the stars. Men are most fully aware of it
when they are in an exalted state of mind&mdash;a state which expresses itself in
images rather than in syllogisms. You may say, of course, that this state of
mind is "purely subjective" and therefore only of artistic value; but the
mystic himself denies that. He believes that he is aware of a reality not
himself, though himself is a part of it; and aware of it, not by the normal use
of the senses, but by a more immediate perception of the spirit. He knows it,
perhaps, through sense perceptions, but by means of a faculty beyond them;
he knows it with the whole of himself, that self which is not often enough of
a unity to attain to this kind of knowledge. This you too must believe, or at
least not refuse to believe, if you are to take him seriously; but the mystic,
even if he does speak to us of an independent reality, speaks with a personal
expression of his own, like the artist. Lâo-tsze has put it better than anyone:
"It is the way of Heaven not to speak, but it knows how to obtain an answer."
When he says Heaven he implies an independent reality; but men make
other men aware of it by the answer they give to it, and this answer is personal
to them.</p>

<p>So a man must convince us of his experience of this Heaven, this reality
not perceived by the senses, by his own expression of it, his own answer.
He must say what moves us by the ordinary means of expression; he must
not pretend that he has a secret to tell us which we can understand only if
he will play his game with his counters, his symbols, and allegories. If he has
seen heaven, then it knows how to obtain an answer from him, exoteric in
its power if esoteric in its meaning, and leading men into its meaning by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
power. The power is in the answer, if the meaning is in the heaven he has
seen, and that heaven is to be known by its fruits.</p>

<p>You must, of course, read a mystic with attention; but you should be able
to gather his meaning as you read; it is to be found in each sentence and in
the whole of each work, not by reference to some other work; for it is the
mark of a bad writer not to be able to say what he has to say in the sentence
he is writing, to give us always jam yesterday, or jam to-morrow, but never
jam to-day. Yet that is what the Blake-fanatics offer us in the Prophetic
Books. You cannot understand this unless you know that the key to it is
in that. You must grasp Blake's "system" if you are to profit by him.
They are like the Gnostics for whom nothing in the Gospels meant what it
seemed to mean; they alone could give you the key to Christ's inner meaning.</p>

<p>Master Eckhart says that the eternal birth which God the father bore and
bears unceasingly in eternity is now born in time and in human nature.
"St. Augustine says this birth is always happening. But, if it happen not in
me, what does it profit me? What matters is that it shall happen in me."
So what matters for the mystic, and his readers, is that the eternal truth shall
happen and be expressed in him, in his actual words. We must not be told
that we can find it by turning from one work to another and by piecing them
all together. He must utter it sentence by sentence, and it must happen in
his sentences, with pain and labour perhaps, but still here and now and in
these very words.</p>

<p>In Blake's Prophetic Books sometimes it happens and sometimes it does
not, and often Blake by his very method seems to prevent it from happening.
He has the weakness of many mystics, the desire for a vast geometrical
system equivalent to the reality he believes himself to be aware of. Such
a system, if once a man will abandon his mind to it, can unroll itself almost
automatically, like a fugue. But many fugues are empty of content; they
persuade the composer that he is saying something with the mechanical
inevitability of their form; and they may also persuade the hearer. It is the
very mechanism that prevents him from saying anything and the hearer from
seeing its emptiness. We do not yet understand that automatism of the mind
which can produce form without content so easily; the automatism of
improvisation in many arts, which you find in some cubist pictures, in much
music, and in Prophetic Books of all ages, especially in the Bible. Blake
himself speaks of it, with seeming inconsistency, in his preface to <i>Jerusalem</i>:
"When this verse was first dictated to me, I considered a monotonous
cadence like that used by Milton and Shakespeare, and all writers of English
Blank Verse, derived from the modern bondage of Riming, to be a necessary
and indispensable part of verse. But I soon found that in the mouth of a true
Orator such monotony was not only awkward but as much a bondage as rime
itself. I therefore have produced a variety in every line, both of cadences and
number of syllables. Every word and every letter is studied and put into its
fit place." You may ask how there could be this choice and study where the
verse was dictated; but Blake means, no doubt, to describe a process of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
writing half-conscious and half-unconscious, as a composer might choose to
write a fugue and then let it write itself. We may use Sheridan's words of this
method: "Easy writing makes damned hard reading"; and <i>Jerusalem</i> is
not easy to read.</p>

<p>Yet it contains great passages and ideas, of which Messrs. Maclagan and
Russell give a very clear account in their edition of it. Like all the great
mystics, Blake was a foreteller of the discoveries of modern psychology; he
knew the evils of "suppression"&mdash;Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than
nurse unacted desires&mdash;and his story, in so far as there is one, is the story of
the human mind in its effort to reach unity, not by suppression but by
"sublimation." Yet it seems to me that his ideas often lost their way in the
myth which he made about them; it is like allegorical painting in which there
is a conflict between the allegory and the people and things represented, and
a sacrifice of one conflicting element to the other. In Blake's story you have
to remember that the characters are not men and women but different parts
or faculties of the human mind; this requires a kind of double attention fatal
in itself to the experience of a work of art, a double attention like that sometimes
demanded by symphonic poems, in which you have to remember the
story while you are listening to the music. If you are writing about the
faculties of the human mind it must be best, both for yourself and for your
readers, to call them by their names and to see them as themselves; so will
you think most clearly and so will the reader understand most easily.</p>

<p>The subject-matter of <i>Jerusalem</i> is really philosophy and psychology, and
it is better expressed in the prose sentences of the <i>Marriage of Heaven and
Hell</i> than in myth. This should be read first by those who wish to understand
Blake's ideas. Like Nietzsche, he went "beyond good and evil." Good
according to the religious, he says, is the passive that obeys reason; evil is the
active that springs from energy; but for Blake himself the conflict between
this active and passive is the real evil; it is what makes men prefer dreams
to reality. By the <i>Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> he means the reconciliation
of reason and energy and the destruction of the delusive, dreamer's,
sense of a sin which yet allures. He who desires but acts not breeds
pestilence. If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise.
The pride of the Peacock is the glory of God. Exuberance is beauty.
Energy is eternal delight. "Those who restrain Desire," he says, "do so
because theirs is weak enough to be restrained; and the restrainer or Reason
usurps its place and governs the unwilling." To Blake Christ means the
harmonious man in whom desire is master, and uses reason as an instrument.
From this follows his belief, which is the belief underlying all religion, that
true, supreme and harmonious desire is for reality, and that from it alone can
reality be discovered. "Everything possible to be believed is an image of the
truth." But, of course, belief to Blake means real belief, belief of the whole
self, belief that is acted upon, not the acceptance of anything on authority.
"I asked&mdash;Does a firm persuasion that a thing is so, make it so? He replied&mdash;All
poets believe that it does, and in ages of imagination this firm persuasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
removed mountains; but many are not capable of a firm persuasion of
anything." Firm persuasion is that unity of the self which, for Blake as for all
mystics, is salvation.</p>

<p>Blake is united to Christianity by his mystical doctrine of forgiveness;
that is what makes him one of the great designers or creators of Christianity,
those who know what Christ himself meant, in whom his passion is born
anew, and to whom his theology is natural truth. This doctrine expresses
itself in Blake's poetry without symbol; we need no key to understand it,
and, whenever it possesses him, it lifts him to its own height and clearness.
The evil of unforgivingness, to him, is in the remembrance of sin which
keeps the sin itself alive:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To record the sin for a reproach, to let the Sun go down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a remembrance of the sin, is a woe and a horror,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A brooder of an evil day, and a Sun rising in blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come then, O Lamb of God, and take away the remembrance of sin.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">That is so, whether a man remembers the sin of others or his own; and he
who remembers the sin of others will remember his own. The sense of sin
comes of the conflict between reason and desire; what we have to do is to end
that conflict and attain to supreme desire and firm persuasion; thinking of the
conflict only perpetuates it. The religion of Jesus was for Blake freedom from
the past, and we attain to it by forgetting the sins of others; then we can
forgive, and forget, our own past selves. Hence his doctrine that Jesus, the
child of desire, was born in the forgiveness of sin; and the most beautiful
passage in <i>Jerusalem</i> is the forgiveness of Mary by Joseph and her song that
follows, "O Forgiveness and Pity and Compassion! If I were pure I should
never have known Thee: If I were unpolluted I should never have glorified
thy Holiness, or rejoiced in thy great Salvation." There is the same doctrine
in the last section of the Everlasting Gospel, and it runs all through the
Songs of Innocence and Experience. God Himself for Blake, as for Christ,
is, by the very logic of the idea God, He who pities and forgives, He who
blots out the past; the divine energy pours itself out in pity and forgiveness,
making life and growth and beauty out of sin itself, justifying even evil,
since, by the forgiving and forgetting of it, it is changed into a good more
subtle, more entrancing, more assured of an infinite increase than any pure
good that needs no change or forgiveness.</p>

<p>In his expressions of this doctrine Blake rises above all our poets by reason
of the richness of his mastered content. He is simpler and deeper, more
passionate and more philosophic, and attains in art to that harmony which
he foretells in life. When I think of it, I am in danger myself of seeing in him
the one prophet, the one poet, the infallible. I am sure, at least, that he will
seem greater through all the new discoveries and enlarged experience of
posterity.</p>

<h2>SHELLEY AND HIS PUBLISHERS</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With Some New Letters</i>)</p>

<p class="center b1">By ROGER INGPEN</p>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">SHELLEY'S</span> transactions with his publishers were numerous; the
books of no great English poet, and certainly none whose literary
career at the most extended for not more than thirteen years,
can have borne the names of so many separate firms. Until he
placed his poems in the hands of the Olliers, almost every book was
issued by a new publisher. Every one of his works was a failure, and
only one went into a second edition; his wide fame as a poet was entirely
posthumous. Although none of Shelley's publishers was sufficiently interested
to repeat the experience of issuing a second book by him, he was not
discouraged by this want of sympathy. He continued until the end to write
and to print his works at his own expense, and, if possible, to find publishers
for them. In the absence of a publisher he issued them himself. He began
and ended by verse-writing, but in the interval his work was varied enough,
comprising novels, drama, philosophy, satire, religious polemics, and
politics. In recalling some facts connected with Shelley's literary enterprises
a curious repetition of names and incidents will be noticeable. There were
two separate publishers of the name of Stockdale with whom he treated,
one in Pall Mall and the other in Dublin. There was an Eton and an Eaton,
the former a printer in Dublin, and the latter the publisher of the Third
Part of Paine's <i>Age of Reason</i>, on behalf of whom Shelley wrote his <i>Letter
to Lord Ellenborough</i>. Stockdale, of Pall Mall, and Munday, of Oxford, both
listened with astonishment to his unrestrained conversation on matters of
religion, and endeavoured to lead him into an orthodox frame of mind. His
boyish appearance and engaging enthusiasm undoubtedly made a strong
appeal to them. There was a prolonged similarity in the fate of some of his
early productions. Practically the whole edition of the <i>Victor and Cazire</i>
volume was destroyed at the author's request, and <i>The Necessity of Atheism</i>
and the <i>Letter to Lord Ellenborough</i> shared a like fate, though without
Shelley's consent.</p>

<p>In the year 1809 Shelley and his cousin, Tom Medwin, wrote a poem in
the style of Scott's narrative verse on <i>The Wandering Jew</i>. It was sent to
Scott's publisher, Ballantyne, of Edinburgh, who replied that it was "better
suited to the character and liberal feelings of the English than the bigoted
spirit" which the writer declared "yet pervades many cultivated minds in
this country. Even Walter Scott is assailed on all hands at present by our
Scotch spiritual and evangelical magazines and institutions for having
promulgated atheistical doctrines with <i>The Lady of the Lake</i>." This astonishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
statement was evidently an excuse for declining <i>The Wandering Jew</i>, which
found no publisher during Shelley's lifetime. He was, however, at that date
busily occupied with his novel <i>Zastrozzi</i>, which he offered to Longmans.
He may have been drawn to that firm as the publishers of a romance, which
he is said to have admired and indeed to have imitated in <i>Zastrozzi</i>, entitled
<i>Zofloya, or the Moor</i>, by Mrs. Byron, or Charlotte Dacre, better known by
her pseudonym, Rosa Malilda. Although rejected by Longmans, <i>Zastrozzi</i>
was published while Shelley was still at Eton by another Paternoster Row
firm, Wilkie and Robinson. We are told that the young author received
£40 or £50 for the book, apparently the only money he ever earned by his
pen, which sum he spent in providing a farewell banquet to twelve of his
schoolfellows.</p>

<p>There is a tradition that Shelley's grandfather, Sir Bysshe, paid for the
printing at Horsham of some of the boy's earliest writings, but apparently
none of these efforts has survived. Local printing offices seem to have had
an attraction for Shelley; we shall see later that he printed books at Dublin,
Barnstaple, Oxford, Leghorn, and Pisa.</p>

<p>Shelley's selection of Worthing, rather than Horsham, for his next venture
may have been determined by his desire for secrecy. He made a selection of
seventeen poems by himself and his sister Elizabeth with the title of <i>Original
Poetry by Victor and Cazire</i>, and put it into the hands of C. and W. Phillips,
of Worthing. A daughter of the printer, "an intelligent, brisk young woman,"
was the active member of the firm, with whom Shelley was on very good
terms. Shelley took great interest in the technical side of the business, and
spent hours in the printing office learning typesetting. Some months
later when at Oxford he had occasion to find a printer for his pamphlet,
<i>The Necessity of Atheism</i>, he again resorted to Messrs. Phillips, who both
printed and added their names to the tract. When Shelley got into trouble
in connection with <i>The Necessity</i>, his father's solicitors drafted a letter
warning the printers of an impending prosecution, and recommending them
not to proceed with the printing of any manuscripts that they might have
by Shelley. Apparently the letter was never sent, and no prosecution was
instituted against the printers, as Munday, the Oxford bookseller, who had
been an unwilling agent in selling the pamphlet, sent a similar warning
to them.</p>

<p>Before the printing of the <i>Original Poetry of Victor and Cazire</i> was completed,
Shelley called on J. J. Stockdale, a publisher in Pall Mall, and
persuaded him to publish the volume. Stockdale was a man with a doubtful
past, who had issued a good deal of verse on commission for obscure verse-writers,
besides the scandalous <i>Memoirs of Harriette Wilson</i>. In later years
he described, in <i>Stockdale's Budget</i>, a curious publication which is to be seen
in the British Museum, how he received 1480 copies of the <i>Original Poetry</i>,
and how he discovered, after some of them had been sent out to the press,
that the volume contained a poem by M. G. Lewis. On inviting Shelley to
explain this circumstance, the poet "expressed the warmest resentment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
at the imposition practised upon him by the coadjutor," and instructed
Stockdale to destroy all the remaining copies; only three or four are now
known to have survived. In the meantime Stockdale had undertaken to
revive and publish Shelley's second novel, <i>St. Irvyne: or, the Rosicrucian</i>.
The author's expectation to get at least £60 for this romance from Robinson,
the publisher of <i>Zastrozzi</i>, was not realised, as the terms arranged with
Stockdale were that the book should be published at the author's expense.
The publisher mournfully recorded the fact some years later that the romance
did not sell, and that he was never paid for the printer's bill. While <i>St.
Irvyne</i> was going through the press Shelley used to call at Stockdale's shop.
The publisher became alarmed at the tone of Shelley's conversation, and,
in the hope that his intentions would be well received, he communicated his
suspicions to Shelley's father. Mr. Timothy Shelley, however, only snubbed
Stockdale for his pains. Shelley was furious at the interference, and all hopes
of obtaining a settlement of his bill vanished.</p>

<p>When Mr. Timothy Shelley took his son up to Oxford in October, 1810,
he called with him at the shop of Munday &amp; Slatter, the booksellers,
where he advised him to get his supplies of books and stationery. Then,
turning to the bookseller, he said, "My son here has a literary turn, he is
already an author, and do pray indulge him in his printing freaks." A month
later Shelley took some of his verses to Munday, who agreed to publish them.
His friend Hogg saw the proofs and, ridiculing their intended sincerity,
suggested that with some corrections they would make burlesque poetry.
Shelley somewhat reluctantly agreed, and the verses were altered to fit the
title of <i>The Posthumous Verses of Margaret Nicholson</i>, edited by her nephew,
John Fitzvictor. The lady in question was a mad washerwoman, who had
attempted the life of George III. in 1786, and was in 1810 still an inmate of
Bedlam, though nominally dead as far as the world was concerned.</p>

<p>The fictitious nephew Fitzvictor was apparently a son of the Victor who
had but recently collaborated with the peccant Cazire. When Shelley
informed the bookseller that he had changed his mind about publishing,
and showed him the altered verses, Munday was so pleased with the
idea that he offered to publish the book on his own account, promising
secrecy and as many gratis copies as might be required. The book was issued
as a bold quarto, and it became the fashion, says Hogg, among gownsmen to
be seen reading it in the High Street, "as a mark of nice discernment of a
delicate and fastidious taste in poetry and the very criterion of a choice
spirit." Shelley was frequently in Munday &amp; Slatter's shop, where he was
in the habit of talking on his favourite subjects. The booksellers, like Stockdale,
became uneasy at the tone of his conversation and endeavoured to
reason with him. Failing to make any impression, they persuaded him
to meet a Mr. Hobbes, for whom they afterwards published a poetical work
called <i>The Widower</i>. Mr. Hobbes undertook "to analyse Shelley's arguments,
and endeavoured to refute them philosophically." But Shelley was not
convinced; he declined to reply in writing to Mr. Hobbes' arguments, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
declared that he would rather meet any or all of the dignitaries of the Church
than one philosopher. If Mr. Hobbes' arguments were no better than his
verses, Shelley was fully justified in his objections. Mr. Slatter, who has left
a record of these facts, tells us that when some months later Shelley strewed
the windows and counters of Munday's shop with copies of <i>The Necessity
of Atheism</i>, which he had caused to be printed by his Worthing friends the
Phillips, he instructed their shopman to sell the pamphlet as fast as he could
at a charge of sixpence each. The result was magical. Mr. Walker, Fellow
of New College, dropped into the shop and examined the tract and drew the
booksellers' attention to its dangerous tendency. They resolved to destroy
the copies, and promptly made a bonfire of them in the back kitchen.
Shelley's expulsion from the University followed in due course.</p>

<p>Shelley's activities in Dublin, in February and March, 1812, made it
necessary for him to employ a printer, or printers, for his two pamphlets,
<i>An Address to the Irish People</i> and <i>Proposals for an Association of Philanthropists</i>,
but neither of these tracts bore the name of a publisher, and there
are no details forthcoming of the circumstances connected with their production.
Shelley, however, placed a collection of his poems in the hands of a
firm of Dublin printers, Messrs. R. and J. Stockdale, but they refused to
proceed with the book until they were paid, and it was never issued. The
manuscript was recovered after Shelley left Dublin, and remained unprinted
for seventy years, until Professor Dowden included some selections from it
in his <i>Life of Shelley</i>.</p>

<p>I can find no record of when or how Shelley first met Thomas Hookham,
but his earliest published letter to him, July 29th, 1812, was evidently
preceded by others that have not been preserved. Hookham's Library was an
old-established business in Old Bond Street, and about the year 1811 Thomas
Hookham the younger and his brother Edward started publishing on
their own account at their father's address. They issued the second edition
of Peacock's <i>The Genius of the Thames</i> and <i>The Philosophy of Melancholy</i>,
and Hogg's novel, <i>Memories of Prince Alexy Haimatoff</i>, of which Shelley
subsequently wrote a review. Shelley sent Thomas Hookham copies of his
<i>Letter to Lord Ellenborough</i>, which he had printed at Barnstaple, but the
tract shared the same fate as <i>The Necessity of Atheism</i>, and was destroyed by
the printer as a dangerous publication. One copy was preserved by Hookham,
the only one now known to exist; it is in the Bodleian Library. In March,
1813, when Shelley was in Dublin for the second time, he sent Hookham the
manuscript of <i>Queen Mab</i>, and added that he was preparing the notes to
be printed with the poem, which was to be long, philosophical, and anti-Christian.
"Do not," he said, "let the title-page be printed before the body
of the poems. I have a motto to introduce from Shakespeare and a preface.
I shall expect no success. Let only 250 copies be printed in a small neat
quarto, on fine paper, and so as to catch the aristocrats. They will not read
it, but their sons and daughters may." Nothing further seems to be known
about the printing of the poem. It was issued as a small octavo, with a title-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>page
bearing the name of Shelley as author as well as printer, and the address
of his father-in-law, 23 Chapel Street, Grosvenor Square. The late Mr.
Edward Hookham, Thomas Hookham's nephew, stated that <i>Queen Mab</i>
was the cause of Shelley's quarrel with Hookham. A coolness was certainly
evident between the poet and the publisher after Shelley came to London in
1813. <i>Queen Mab</i> may have been placed in the printer's hands before
Hookham saw the notes, and when he saw them he probably declined to go
on with the book or allow it to bear his name. But Shelley's connection with
Hookham, which previous to this rupture had been friendly, was not entirely
severed, for Hookham's imprint, with Ollier's, appears on <i>The History of a Six
Week's Tour</i>, 1817. Thomas Hookham was a cultivated and well-read man
and the author of an anonymous little record of foreign travel which he undertook
during the same year as Shelley's visit to the Continent, and published
as <i>A Walk through Switzerland in September</i>, 1816. He is said to have
written the <i>Shelley Memorials</i>, which is described on the title-page as by
Lady Shelley, the wife of Shelley's son. Thomas Hookham's brother, Edward,
was the friend and correspondent of Thomas Love Peacock, whose letters to
him have been lately printed.</p>

<p><i>The Vindication of Natural Diet</i>, Shelley's vegetarian tract, was reprinted
in 1813 from one of the notes to <i>Queen Mab</i>. As the text of the pamphlet
differs in some respects from that as given with the poem, it is evident that
Shelley was responsible for the reprint, which was issued by J. Calow, a
medical bookseller in Soho. Nothing, however, is known of the circumstances
connected with the publication of this tract, and there are no references to it
in Shelley's published correspondence.</p>

<p>John Murray was not one of Shelley's publishers, but he had some correspondence
in 1816 with the Great Cham of Albemarle Street. In his first
letter he described himself as "a total stranger" and offered Murray the
publication of <i>Alastor</i>, of which he had printed 250 copies at his own expense.
The offer was declined, and the book was subsequently published by two
firms, Baldwin, Craddock &amp; Joy, of Paternoster Row, and Carpenter &amp; Son,
of Old Bond Street. In the summer of that year Shelley was in Switzerland
with Byron, who requested him to correct and see through the press the
third canto of <i>Childe Harold</i> and <i>The Prisoner of Chillon</i>. Shelley brought
the MS. of the <i>Childe</i> with him to England, and when he saw Murray he
reminded him that he wished to see the proofs. From a later letter it
appears that Murray announced the poems without sending the proofs to
Shelley, who at once wrote urging him to carry out Byron's request.</p>

<p>The names of the Olliers, Shelley's last publishers, first appear on the
title-page of his Hermit of Marlow pamphlet, <i>A Proposal for Putting Reform
to the Vote throughout the Kingdom</i>, 1817. This tract must have been one of
the first publications of Charles and James Ollier to bear their imprint, for
they commenced business at 3 Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square, in the
year 1817. The Ollier family was of French descent, but they had been
settled in the West of England for many years. Charles Ollier, Shelley's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
correspondent in his negotiations with the firm, was born at Bath in 1788,
came up to London and entered a banking house. At an early age he showed
a liking for literature, and developed a taste for collecting and reading old
books. He subsequently became an author and the friend of authors, among
whom was Leigh Hunt, who probably introduced him to Shelley. Ollier and
Hunt were both devoted to the theatre and to music. Hunt addressed his
verses, "A Thought on Music: suggested by a Private Concert, May 13th,
1815," to Ollier, who published some volumes of Hunt's poetry. One of the
earliest of the Olliers' publications was Keats's first volume of <i>Poems</i>, 1817.
The book, unhappily, was not well received, and Keats, who attributed its
want of success to the neglect of his publishers, took his next volume,
<i>Endymion</i>, to another firm. The Olliers published besides Lamb's works in
two volumes, 1818, and Ollier's own stories, <i>Altham and His Wife</i> and <i>Inesilla</i>,
all of which are mentioned in the letters printed below. Shelley followed
up his pamphlet with a more ambitious venture, namely, <i>Laon and Cythna</i>,
which he printed at his own expense, and arranged for it to be published
jointly by Sherwood, Neeby, &amp; Jones, and the Olliers. Before the book was
published, but after some copies had been sent out, Ollier discovered in the
poem certain passages which he regarded as too frank for circulation,
at least by his hands. Shelley agreed, though not without some vigorous
protests, to tone down the offending expressions, and the book was issued,
with the names of the Olliers alone, as <i>The Revolt of Islam</i>. The correspondence
relating to this and other matters has been published, but the
following letters to Ollier have not, so far as I am aware, been printed, except
portions of the first and last. Ollier apparently kept all the letters that
he received from Shelley, but when Mrs. Shelley asked for the use of them,
he declined on the score that they were valuable to him and he had been
offered no money.</p>

<p>To conclude these remarks on Ollier, it may be mentioned that he also
published for Shelley <i>The Cenci</i>, second edition (1821), <i>Rosalind and Helen</i>
(1819), <i>Prometheus Unbound</i> (1820), <i>Epipsychidion</i> (1821), and <i>Hellas</i> (1822).
He also issued a publication called <i>Olliers' Literary Miscellany</i> (1820), to
which Peacock contributed an essay on Poetry. This essay prompted Shelley
to write as a reply his eloquent <i>Defence of Poetry</i>, which was intended for a
later issue, but the first was the only number issued. The Olliers abandoned
publishing in 1822, the year of Shelley's death. Their want of success was
attributed to a lack of business capacity on the part of the partners and
insufficient capital.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> This work, a commentary by Taafe on Dante, was printed, like <i>Adonais</i>, at Pisa by a
printer who used the types of Didot, the celebrated French typefounder. Byron interested
himself in the book, and it was subsequently published by John Murray. Professor Dowden
printed the middle paragraph of this letter.</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
The more considerable portion of this work will consist of the comment.
I have read with much attention this portion, as well as the verses, up to the
eighth Canto; and I do not hesitate to assure you that the lights which the
annotator's labours have thrown on the obscurer parts of the text are such
as all foreigners and most Italians would derive an immense additional
knowledge of Dante from. They elucidate a great number of the most
interesting facts connected with Dante's history of his times; and everywhere
bear the mark of a most elegant and accomplished mind. I know you
will not take my opinion on Poetry, because I thought my own verses very
good, and you find that the public declare them to be unreadable. Show
this to Mr. Procter, who is far better qualified to judge than I am. There
are certainly passages of great strength and conciseness; indeed the author
has sacrificed everything to represent his original truly, in this latter point
pray observe the great beauty of the typography; they are the same types
as my elegy on Keats is printed from.</p>

<p>You cannot do me a greater favour than in making some satisfactory
arrangement with the author. Of course I cannot expect, nor do I wish, that
you should undertake any thing that should not fairly promise to promote
your own interest. But pray allow my recommendation to overbalance, if
your determination should be in equilibrium. I feel persuaded that I am
recommending a most excellent work, and one without which the history
and the spirit of the age of Dante as relates to him will never be understood
by the English students of that astonishing poet.</p>

<h2>PHOTOGRAPHY AND ART</h2>

<p class="center">By HOWARD HANNAY</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">EVER</span> since Plato reluctantly condemned art on the ground that it
was mere imitation of superficial outward appearances the
problem of art has been disputed on this basis. Plato did not allow
the artist any initiative except to imitate, and his conception of
ideal beauty had no connection with the activities of the poet, painter, and
sculptor: it was not concerned with æsthetic beauty, but with intellectual
and moral fitness and perfection. Aristotle gave a slightly different interpretation
to the work of the artist, defining it as a description of the possible as
contrasted with history which determines what has actually happened.
Plotinus introduced the element of the ideal: the artist does not so much
imitate natural reality as externalise an archetype existing in his mind or
soul. Plotinus partly identified art with Plato's ideal beauty.</p>

<p>These three alternative views constitute the starting-point for the three
chief divergent explanations of art which have been developed during the
last two thousand years. In modern terminology they would be designated
as theories of art, respectively as "reproduction," as "imagination," as
"idealisation." The extent of their mutual discrepancy varies according to
the exact meaning attached to the last two conceptions, imagination and
idealisation. For instance, if the latter ultimately amounts to selecting certain
particularly attractive real forms and events, it is virtually merely an eclectic
process of reproduction. Imagination, again, may be regarded simply as a
composite memory. Samuel Butler said, "Imagination is mainly memory, but
there is a small percentage of creation of something out of nothing with it."
It is only in so far as imagination is creative that it is different in kind from
reproduction, from perception and history. And if idealisation is not a
selection of given realities but a making articulate of an inner vision it
also is a kind of imagination, only it is confined to the pleasantly beautiful,
the attractive. The importance of all three definitions tends to be diminished
when, as is often the case with modern theories, the chief emphasis is laid on
the feeling or emotional element in art. Natural objects and real events can
presumably excite emotion as much as imaginative creations, and this fact
appears to lend a new value to the act of reproduction. The centre of interest
is transferred from the knowledge content to the feeling of the subject and
the knowledge content, the consciousness of the object is regarded simply
as a cause which brings about that for which art exists, viz., emotion. The
aim of reproduction is no longer intrinsic, but falls outside in the resultant
subjective feeling. But this means a somewhat arbitrary distinction between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
the emotion and the representation. In actual concrete experience the two
are so closely linked together that they appear almost identical: the emotion
inheres in the representation. It cannot, therefore, be regarded as an instance
of cause and effect: it is not analogous to the process of a pin and the
ensuing prick, where the cause, the pin, is quite distinct from and independent
of the feeling of pain. Mere associations of ideas are, on the other hand,
nearer to the cause and effect sequence. A certain scent recalls a whole
chapter of one's past history. Mr. Bosanquet's portmanteau reminds him of
<span class="locked">Florence.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> For this reason a tendency is apparent to connect emotion more
definitely with imaginative and idealistic art. Mere reproduction is cold and
bald and only evokes an emotion by a fortuitous association of ideas: whereas
the genuine product "expresses" or contains the emotion; and in doing so
it is thought that it inevitably alters the "natural" or "historical" fact,
distorting, transmuting it.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> <i>Three Lectures on Æsthetics</i>, p. 49.</p></div>

<p>The applicability of these various theories appears on the surface, at any
rate, to differ according to the different arts. No one can be a thorough-going
realist with regard to music, which is so indisputably a self-contained independent
construction. It may be debatable whether music expresses experiences
which are not of music, but music certainly does not imitate or reproduce them
unless they are in the first place sounds, and for the most part they are not.
The problem, therefore, is not whether music reproduces but whether it
"expresses" anything except itself. Literature, again, can only directly
imitate conversations between people: for the rest it can only reproduce
indirectly either by symbolising or expressing. The symbol is purely
arbitrary, it is entirely a referring to something other than itself. Letters
of the alphabet have become symbolical. The expression, on the other
hand, contains something of the object expressed, it carries a world in
itself and of its own. Literature is admittedly expression, and here the
problem takes the form of a contrast between history and fiction, whether
at bottom literature only expresses historical fact (realism) or imagined fact,
the possible.</p>

<p>Painting and sculpture are for the æsthetic theorist in many ways the most
complex of the arts. As has been pointed out, neither music nor literature can
be said to reproduce directly if they reproduce at all, because they employ a
different medium, namely, sounds and words. But painting and sculpture
apparently employ as a medium the very objects to be reproduced or
expressed, viz., colours and lines. In literature the word refers to a reality
that seemingly is not itself a word. In painting the picture and the reality
can apparently be "matched" so that here literally the picture imitates
reality. Outside and around us are already colours and forms, but there are
no words, and only the crudest sounds. And so painting is easily regarded as
<i>par excellence</i> the imitative or reproductive art, and of all arts to have the easiest
and most direct criterion: resemblance to external reality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>These are the premises with which the realists and the romanticists,
cubists, futurists, etc., start. They all assume rather naïvely the existence of
an immediately perceived natural reality of given colours and forms. Their
divergence is in their views as to the activity of the artist in respect of this
natural reality. The realist considers that the painter's function is to transcribe
it, to copy it on to canvas. He may select certain aspects which appeal to him,
in fact he paints a particular scene exactly because that scene gives him more
pleasure than others. But his creativeness is limited to this selection of given
scenes and to their skilful and accurate reproduction.</p>

<p>The opponents of this view (and they include the majority of persons who
have any serious acquaintance with painting) maintain that the essential
element in a picture is not its resemblance to something else, but its intrinsic
interest, and, this being the case, so long as the painting contains and conveys
an emotion that is inherent in its line and colour it does not matter if there
is not a literal resemblance to real objects. In fact, it is thought that the very
effort to express a subjective mood centring round an external situation, to
project one's own imaginative life into that which itself has no life, inevitably
results in a certain distortion of the natural reality, in a deliberate emphasising
of certain features. The line vibrates with feeling, the colour is grouped and
blended so as to conform to the emotion of the individual mood, irrespective
of whether "out there" the artist can actually "see" such an arrangement.
The photograph has tended strongly to confirm this theory. Back in the
eighties J. A. Symonds wrote, "The artist cannot avoid modifying his
imitation of the chosen object by the impression of his own subjective
quality. Human art is unable to reproduce nature except upon such
terms as these. It cannot draw as accurately as the sun does by means of
the photographic camera. Art will never match the infinite variety and
subtlety of nature; no drawing or painting will equal the primary beauties
of the living model ... yet art has qualities derived from the
intellectual selective imaginative faculties of man which more than justify
its existence." Walter Pater went a step further and asserted that "Art
constantly aspires towards the condition of music. For while in all other
works of art it is possible to distinguish the matter from the form and the
understanding can always make this distinction, yet it is the constant aim of
art to obliterate it."</p>

<p>The cubist and futurist art theories are a logical development of certain
implications contained in arguments such as these: they are an attempt to
make pictorial and plastic art identical with what music is supposed to be
to get rid altogether of the irrelevant incubus of representation. They are
quite distinct from the explanation often advanced for the primitive simplificatory
character of Post-Impressionist art. The latter retains and is not a
bit afraid of a representative content; it merely advocates a revolt from
tradition and from the inclusion of facts which we know to be there in the
objects depicted without actually seeing or perceiving them. Its purpose is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
a musical elaboration of our vision, but a clarification and purging of it of
all derivative and merely intellectual elements. Hence the stress laid on the
art and vision of the child and the primitive. There is no doubt, however,
that the explanations offered of the art of Gauguin, Van Gogh, and Cézanne
gradually led to the cubist theory. It was felt that not only were these artists
breaking away from tradition in order to attain clearness and directness of
vision, but that their vision was expressive rather than representative.
"Primitive art, like the art of children, consists not so much in an attempt to
represent what the eye perceives as to put a line round a mental conception
of the object. Like the work of the primitive artist, the pictures children draw
are often extraordinarily <span class="locked">expressive."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Catalogue, Post-Impressionist Exhibition, Grafton Galleries, 1910-11, pp. 11-12.</p></div>

<p>It should be noted that the early Post-Impressionists were artists first
and theorists afterwards, and they did not themselves produce the theories
which attempt to explain their art. The later men, on the other hand, appear
to have consummated a remarkable marriage of philosophical reflection and
artistic expression. Their art is the conscious execution of their argument.
There is no <i>a priori</i> objection to this luminous rationality. The only essential
is that the argument should be correct. Therefore, while one cannot
condemn the art of Van Gogh, Gauguin, and Cézanne on the ground that
the explanatory theories subsequently put forward are fallacious, a great
many of the cubist experiments live or fall with their theory.</p>

<p>While Cubism and Futurism had a similar origin they very soon parted
ways, and each followed the light of its own peculiar interpretation. The
difference of opinion concerned not the departure from verisimilitude to
persons and natural objects, about which both were in agreement, but the
content and character of the expression. The futurists wanted, so to speak,
programme music, the cubists pure music without any taint of worldly and
literary associations. It is curious that these two movements which started so
near together should diverge to either extreme, Cubism to enshrine itself in
a pure inhuman emotion which possesses an absolutely divine "in itselfness,"
but is totally unrelated to the rest of life, and can, therefore, only be
ejaculated about, and Futurism "to introduce brutally life into art, to
combat the old ideal æsthetic, static, decorative, effeminate, precious, cynical
that loathed <span class="locked">action."<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span> Cubism is fugitive, mystical, averse to science and
the world of raw human passion. Futurism is explosive with mundane
energy; it is not merely a theory of art, literature, music, it is a new orientation
embracing the whole of life; "on every question, in Parliament, in
communal councils, and in the market-places, men are divided into lovers
of the past (<i>passatisti</i>) and futurists." Yet it is not so much the whole of
life that the futurists wish to express as that part of it which is peculiarly
modern, its movement, its flux, its dynamism. Any theory of a disruptive,
hurly-burly aspect is grist to the mill of Futurism. With what acclamation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
will Professor Einstein's relativism be greeted: except that space should be
angular rather than gracefully curved! And it is again curious how the
extremes tend to meet. The Futurist's state, <i>nous aspirons à la création
d'un type inhumain en qui seront aboli la douleur morale, la bonté, la tendresse
et l'amour</i>.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> Man must become metallic, mechanical, and dynamical. Mr.
Clive Bell aspires (if only in art) after an inhuman emotion crystallised in
abstract plastic form, in intricate relations of masses: a sort of divine
mathematical matter.</p>

<p>Recently an interesting controversy has taken place in the <i>Burlington
Magazine</i> between Mr. Roger Fry and Mr. D. S. Maccoll on the question of
representative and abstract or purely decorative form. Mr. Maccoll stands
for the older school of J. A. Symonds; Mr. Roger Fry would assimilate
pictorial art to music and deprive it altogether of a world outside itself.
Both are in agreement as to art being non-photographic, and as to the
existence parallel with or prior to visual emotional art of a photographic visual
consciousness. Art, they both admit, is not reproductive; to reproduce is the
function of photography and of the photographic side of our minds.</p>

<p>Art is temperamental, the expression in line and colour of emotion. But
while Mr. Maccoll thinks that the emotion lies mainly in the rhythm of the
objects represented, Mr. Fry considers that we are wrong in concerning
ourselves either with the ideas and sentiments of the artist or with his
interpretation of objects. We must appreciate and judge a drawing solely
according to the degree of beauty the lines set up among themselves. Mr.
Maccoll shrewdly points out that Mr. Fry and his school always lay great
emphasis on "mass," "volume," "plasticity," etc., which are definitely
characters of objects and, therefore, representative. It is possible, however,
to go further: even a line and a colour are natural objects, and if we are able
to find enjoyment in simple arrangements of lines and colours, why should
we not find equal enjoyment in trees and clouds and hills and people?
Stated thus these are generalities, but so are lines and colours: in a picture,
however, or a decoration they are endowed with individual life, with a unique
tone and significance.</p>

<p>In order to be absolutely logical, neither Mr. Roger Fry nor Mr. Clive
Bell should attempt to describe or explain a picture at all. It is a world in a
watertight compartment entirely severed and shut off from the ordinary
world. It either throws us into an ecstasy or it does not, but these ecstasies
are so many discrete units, and if they differ we cannot articulate the difference.
We ought not, for instance, to describe early Italian art as ascetically
religious, Botticelli as pagan and lyrical, Hogarth as satirical. For this would
be ascribing to art a content extracted from life, it would be turning art into
literature. Even literature, however, at its best is devoid of meaning. "In
great poetry," writes Mr. Clive Bell, "it is the formal music that
makes the miracle. The poet expresses in verbal form an emotion but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
distantly related to the words set down." And he quotes Shakespeare's
poetry as an instance of this great meaningless word music. This surely
is the <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> of the whole theory.</p>

<p>Mr. Clive Bell defines art as significant form. At first sight it would appear
as though the delimitations set up by the reduction of art to abstract form
were swept away by the admission of "significance" which might include
in its range the whole world. But the significance is indescribable except in
terms of form itself. Hence there is a certain justification in Mr. Maccoll's
contention that Mr. Clive Bell really means "insignificant form." In his
reply Mr. Bell falls back on the conception of emotion. The significance is
emotional, it is not only incommunicable except by means of the actual
work of art, but is also totally unrelated to life in general: it is an intelligible
and self-contained department of its own, and does not require the liaison
work of the critical guide and commentator.</p>

<p>The fact is that in their most legitimate preoccupation of ensuring that
the work of art shall be a world in itself, a unity whose essential significance
and content does not lie outside itself in a world of which it is merely a
superfluous copy, but is firmly grasped and held in its imaginative synthesis so
that the content is identical with the form. Messrs. Roger Fry, Clive Bell and Co.
have gone absolutely to the other extreme and deprived the work of art of
all content and significance; they have rendered it a discrete unit instead of
an individual unit. Now, there is only one mental activity which deals with
discrete units, and that is mathematics. Hence we can detect a gradual
assimilation in their critical terminology to the language of mathematics and
physics. The mysticism of art is becoming the mysticism of planes, angles,
cubes, surfaces and relations of lines and masses.</p>

<p>But Mr. Clive Bell has another and equally legitimate preoccupation. He
has observed that he experiences the same kind of pleasure from a fine piece
of architecture, a specimen of pottery, a decoration on a carpet, as from a
painting inside a frame which ostensibly refers to people and objects existing
independently outside the frame. And he concludes that all these works
must admit of reduction to a common denomination, they all have that in
common which induces us to call them works of art. Obviously as architecture
is non-representative in the ordinary sense, we must excogitate a general
definition which does not necessitate representation. And so by a simple
classificatory abstracting process he arrives at the formula of "significant
form."</p>

<p>Now this expressly refers only to pictorial art and does not pretend to
be a definition of music, literature, dancing, etc. These, however, all come
under the heading of art, and any formula for any single branch of art
must contain something of the universal essence of art in general. This
cannot lurk in the conception of form, because by form Mr. Bell means not
the logical concept, but the spatial physical image. It must, therefore, inhere
in the conception of significance. Pictorial art is something significant
expressed in the medium of spatial form. But here we come up against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
first preoccupation of eschewing all so-called literary content. The significance
of Rembrandt's dramatic masterpiece, for instance, "Christ and the
Woman taken in Adultery," must consist in the relation of the colours and
lines to each other and not in its intensely dramatic human expression,
which is an illegitimate literary association of ideas. The significance is
wrapt up in the abstract spatial image and, therefore, so far from defining
the essence of all art, including literature and music, it will not even cover
dramatic representational painting. In his preoccupation of including
decorative art in his definition Mr. Bell has excluded all other kinds of art,
and has simply universalised the idiosyncrasy of decorative art.</p>

<p>He has not, however, really achieved that, because even decorative art has
what Mr. Bell would call a literary significance. No one can seriously reflect
upon Egyptian, Greek, and Gothic architecture without admitting how
profoundly they are charged with historical meaning, and that it is precisely
this meaning which differentiates them and gives them their individuality.
They are the spirit of their respective ages, caught up and embodied in what
by an abstractive process of thought we refer to as abstract form. Actually it is
only abstract when thought of apart from a particular instance: in any given
instance, <i>e.g.</i>, the Cenotaph in Whitehall, it is as concrete and individual as
an ordinary picture or statue: it is a manifestation and expression of the
human mind in a particular set of circumstances.</p>

<p>The foregoing analysis brings out two facts. The new art of abstract
significant form is not, strictly speaking, anything new: it is as old, if not
older, than representational art, and it is equally pregnant with literary
meaning. Until quite recently, however, it has never been condensed into
the form of a picture and surrounded with a frame; it has almost without
exception been connected with objects of utility. This does not detract from
its value in the slightest; it may mean that abstract art will outlive the
picture; it is simply a statement of historical fact. Nor can we draw the
immediate inference that abstract art is inappropriate in a frame. Certainly
the contrary would be inappropriate: that is to say, if we built a house in
the form of an Assyrian lion or made a hearthrug after Rembrandt's picture
of an old woman. But it is significant that the cubist and futurist art has so
far exercised a far greater and more beneficial influence in the direction of
curtains, upholstery, and dresses than of pictures. Moreover, one of the
leading English apostles of futurist art, Mr. Wyndham Lewis, is beginning
to realise the immense field which lies open to him in the sphere of architecture,
and is growing impatient with the limitations and narrow confines of
the picture <span class="locked">frame.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span></p>

<p>However this may be, the lovers both of representational art and of
abstract art must live and let live, and the wrangle as to which is the most
perfect, the purest kind of art, is as sterile and futile as the dispute over
prose and poetry, opera and chamber music, tragedy and comedy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The problem, however, of photographic reproduction and of imagination
still awaits a satisfactory solution. We have seen that no objection whatsoever
can be raised against the marvellous representative detail of, say,
Jan Van Eyck's "Jan Arnolfini and His Wife." Nor can we explain the joy
and love expressed in the picture by reference merely to the forms and
colours in abstraction from the objects and persons. For that would be
transforming the living and individual unity of artistic vision into the
abstract schemata of scientific thought. And art is not science, although it
might very well express the delights and struggles of the scientist. But, on
the other hand, there are pictures which, at any rate, appear to represent
objects with the same accuracy and detail as Jan Van Eyck, and yet definitely
fail to rank as works of art. They may often give us pleasure, they are often
informative, but a little introspection reveals that that pleasure is due to our
being reminded of something that is not itself in the picture, and that the
information is not about our emotion but about an historical or a scientific
fact. Similarly with the photograph which has still greater precision of
scientific (not artistic) observation, and for that very reason is artistically
still more jejune and barren. But there is yet another visual product which
is neither photographic nor artistic "reproduction," namely, imaginative
representation. From internal as well as external evidence we can infer
that certain pictures were painted by the artist "out of his head," and others
from "the models," and we find that artists like Velasquez, who painted
masterpieces from the model, often failed miserably in their attempts at
imaginative <span class="locked">work.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> Of course, it is doubtful how far this distinction can be
carried; for we have no direct proof that many of the most realistic pictures
were not pure inventions, and that much of the apparently imaginative
work, such as Blake's, was not simply composite memory. Imagination is
just as dangerous and ambiguous a term as reproduction.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Cf. "La Couronnement de la Vierge." A voluminous mass of pompous clothing
floating on some well-fed babies' heads.</p></div>

<p>These, then, are the "facts" to be explained. On the one hand, we
have undeniably a reality of perception and photography which is not that
of art but often extraordinarily akin to it; on the other hand, we have a visual
art which divides itself into three groups, each of which <i>qua</i> art is of equal
value: realistic, imaginative, and, thirdly, formal, decorative, or abstract art.
What is desired is some synthetic conception which will make intelligible
the similarities and differences and contradictions dwelling in these, at any
rate, superficially different kinds of vision.</p>

<p>Behind the conception of thinkers like J. A. Symonds there always lay
the photographic reality which was the common reality of everyone, and
supplied all the materials for the artist's reality: the framework of forms and
colours, of objects and persons. It was regarded from the æsthetic point of
view as rather a nightmare, for it was so unemotional, so much the same all
through, so unpliable. And the explanation of art was that it consisted of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>same reality, but as seen through the temperament of the artist and, therefore,
somehow, by some mysterious wizardy, coloured with emotion,
electrified into all kinds of subjective illuminations, a fascinating mirage.
Or instead of the word temperament one substituted the phrase creative
imagination. This means substantially the same thing, but it leads us away a
bit further from photographic reality, widening the gulf between the two.
We cannot create the outer world, but we can create an inner world of
imagination, and actually bring into our life something intimately new,
shedding a light of its own that never was on sea or land. Drive this argument
a little further and we arrive at Cubism and Futurism.</p>

<p>This is the philosophical view which dominates most art criticism of to-day,
and probably quite rightly so. It is fairly safe, and it "corresponds to the
facts" with tolerable accuracy. It is sufficiently eclectic not to offend either
an ardent philosophical realism or an ardent idealism. And it does not fall
into the error of condemning one kind of art and exalting another, although
our æsthetic taste when unprejudiced by theory proclaims both kinds
equally delightful. This, however, is no reason why we should not attempt
to deepen the theory with a view to giving it a closer organic unity and
explaining facts which it does not seem at present to take into account.
Needless to say, we may get entangled and strike out on a wrong track.
For thinking, like everything else, is experimental.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>1. The very first observation to be made is that ordinary vision is not
photographic: it is shot through and through with emotional elements
which are part and parcel of every concrete colour and form that is seen.
The photographic reality is obtained by a process of thinning down, so that
only the skeleton of similarities remains. It consists of a consciousness of
general facts&mdash;this is a tree, it has leaves with clearly delineated edges,
underneath it is a brown and white cow.</p>

<p>2. Nevertheless, even if the normal man in the street were to depict
precisely the semi-emotional reality which he sees, it would not necessarily
be a work of art. The Royal Academy is a convincing proof of this fact.
But this is not because the normal man's vision is essentially different from
that of the artist; the reason is just the opposite: his seeing is borrowed from
the artist, it is second-hand property. Considered in connection with the
co-ordinated arrangement of the ordinary man's life this borrowed vision
is absolutely correct and in its place, just as is his borrowed knowledge of
science, mathematics, history. But if he tries to isolate it and put it apart in
a frame, claiming for it an original independent value, it immediately
becomes false, pretentious, sentimental. It still, however, is not photographic: it
is an emotion out of place. There is, of course, also in Academy
pictures a great deal of photography, that is to say of general statement.</p>

<p>3. The artistic disvalue of such statements lies not in the fact that they
are reproductive and "true to nature," but in the deliberate stripping of all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
emotional content. So far from giving a completer and truer account of
reality, the photograph gives a thoroughly impoverished <span class="locked">account.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> It must
not, however, be inferred that art should assist or take the place of, say,
geological drawings, because these drawings are intentionally confined to
similarities and general facts.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> The cinematograph drama might become genuine art, because one can look through the
generality of the photograph into the human imaginative synthesis. It is on a par with a
photograph of a picture or of a building.</p></div>

<p>4. The conception of the "creative imagination" is liable to lapse into
a false kind of mysticism. Imagination is always about reality. Rembrandt
possessed a marvellous imagination, yet for that very reason he has considerably
increased and enhanced the human consciousness of reality. In
the same way the interior of a beautiful church evokes and deepens our
consciousness of religious emotion, and, therefore, of the profound significance
of life. And it is not the life of some abstract mysticism, but of man in
the travail of history. All art is imaginative, but it is equally real and objective,
it adds to our consciousness of the world in which we live. We need not
even object to the metaphor about holding the mirror up to nature, for we
cannot see ourselves except in a mirror.</p>

<p>It might be possible, therefore, to overcome the apparent distinction
between "painting from the model" and "out of one's head," and to show
that they are both the same kind of activity. There is no doubt that imaginative
work has its roots in ordinary perception; even the creator of pure
designs is using lines and colours which are visible, and he gets his suggestions
from the external world. And even though in the process of creating
the artist seems to move away from external reality into his inner being, the
created product is definitely about external reality. The Cenotaph in Whitehall
<i>is</i> our mourning over the dead: Goya's etchings <i>The Disasters of War
are</i> part of our concrete consciousness of war. Blake, too, where he is not
lost in impossible symbolism, is always referring back to life.</p>

<p>On the other side, every piece of ordinary perception is shot through with
imagination, as with emotion. The mind is not a <i>tabula rasa</i>, but a most
marvellous and intricate activity. And there is another explanation possible
of the difference between the art, say, of Velasquez and of Fra Angelico
than that the one was reproductive, the other the work of fantasy. At the
time of Velasquez the whole interest and value of life centred round man
and pre-eminently round the life of kings and nobles. On these people
was focussed the emotional imagination of the age. To Fra Angelico the
world was altogether different; its quintessential value lay outside it in our
experience after death: this life was but a preparation for the next, and art
was as it were the imaginative anticipation of the loveliness of heaven.
Nevertheless, this anticipation spoke in terms of the most refined delights
of this world, and the pæan to heaven was but a pæan to the beauty of life.
Or if one may diverge from the artist to an appreciator of art, it is clear from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>Mr. Clive Bell's book, <i>Art</i>, that at the back of his mind there is a mystical
metaphysics, a sort of conviction that the objects and events of this muddled
material world are contemptible, and that we must seek for the reality of
realities in some aloof inhuman state of consciousness. This is his third and
in many ways most interesting preoccupation.</p>

<p>5. Each of the three definitions of art referred to at the beginning of this
essay, those of Plato, Aristotle, and Plotinus, sets up claims which must be
satisfied if we do not want to be continually dogged by their importunate
ghosts. One of the strongest objections to Plato's premise that the artist
imitates is that it does not allow any element of novelty. It is true that in the
physical act of painting the artist reproduces his vision, and that this act
requires considerable technical accomplishment. But throughout the
principal, all-powerful, radiating influence is the vision. This cannot correctly
be called reproductive; it is just the unmediated consciousness of something,
and of that something for the first time. For instance, the artist apparently
works with a limited number of colours just as the musician with notes;
but out of these he produces entirely new colours in combination (colours
are never really out of combination), just as the musician produces literally
new sounds. And this production is not a mere abstract physical fact, it is
emotional and can contain the whole significance of a given period of history.
The seeing of the colours and the emotional impulse coincide: it is an act
of creation. Nor do the colours belong, so to speak, merely to the artist's
palette and canvas, they are seen out there "in nature." It is a new vision of
nature. It is, however, futile for the man in the street, when he sees the
picture for the first time, to refer back to his own past experience, because
this is a new experience, a new vision. At the same time, although the picture
is hung up indoors in a room or gallery, the vision pierces, as it were, right
through the canvas and walls and comes to a halt out there in the mysterious
and infinite world. We have seen that this process of consciousness is
undoubtedly imaginative, even if the completed product is almost historically
real. It is not a mere statement of fact, but it always includes facts, surrounding
them with concrete living individuality. Further, it always contains an element
of the ideal, of aspiration, not of an abstract schematised Utopia or stereotyped
moralising, but of a pulsating individual love and hate. In all art, even
in the most realistic, this is transparent. It is, in a sense, the goodwill bending
over the present and dreaming of the future.</p>

<p>Briefly, pictorial and plastic art is the creation of the visual feeling or
emotional consciousness of the human mind. As such it is inseparably
bound up in real objects, actions, and events. Remove it (speculatively in
thought) and you get the bare though magnificent framework of science
and the stark matters-of-fact of history.</p>

<h2>PROSE AND MORTALITY</h2>

<p class="center">By J. C. SQUIRE</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IN</span> recent years several editors have put together anthologies of English
prose passages, among them Mr. S. L. Edwards (<i>An Anthology of
English Prose</i>; Dent), Messrs. Broadus and Gordon (<i>English Prose</i>;
Milford), Mr. Treble (<i>English Prose</i>; Milford), and Professor Cowl
(<i>An Anthology of Imaginative Prose</i>; Simpkin). Only the last of these books
has much in common with the <span class="locked">"treasury"<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> now presented by Mr. Logan
Pearsall Smith. There are many kinds of good prose, of which Samuel
Butler's is one, Jane Austen's another, Cowley's another: but the last two
of these authors do not appear, and the first is only here by favour. A few
exceptions are made, presumably owing to personal predilections or a feeling
that such and such a great prose name should not be omitted. Swift is an
instance. His prose, the faithful reflection of his mind, has many qualities,
but it is out of place here. Generally speaking, to satisfy Mr. Pearsall
Smith, in his present capacity, it is not enough&mdash;in fact, it is not anything&mdash;that
prose should be adequate to its purpose, neat, easy, vivacious,
well-knit. It must be prose on what by common consent is the highest
level of prose, prose impeccably written, and prose with a dignity, a richness,
a sonority or a sweetness of flow that rival the attributes of great
poetry. Almost all his examples come into this category: he has no room
here for the most vigorous pages of Scott or the most amusing chapters of
Dickens. His extracts are to be detachable jewels, gorgeous or exquisite. On
his fly-leaf he quotes Keats:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> <i>A Treasury of English Prose. Edited by Logan Pearsall Smith. Constable. 6s. net.</i></p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>"I had an idea that a Man might pass a very pleasant life in this manner&mdash;let him
on a certain day read a certain page of full Poesy or distilled Prose, and let him wander
with it, and muse upon it, and reflect from it, and bring home to it, and prophesy
upon it, and dream upon it: until it becomes stale&mdash;But when will it do so?
Never&mdash;When Man has arrived at a certain ripeness in intellect any one grand and
spiritual passage serves him as a starting-post towards all the two-and-thirty Palaces.
How happy is such a voyage of conception, what delicious diligent indolence!"</p></blockquote>

<p>"Distilled Prose," "grand and spiritual passage": the editor gives no other
explanation than this second-hand one, but that is enough.</p>

<p>We must grant Mr. Pearsall Smith his ground, but on that ground every
reader is sure&mdash;as an anthologist's readers always will be&mdash;occasionally to
quarrel with him. His earlier selections, from the Bible, Donne, and Jeremy
Taylor, could not, I think, have been better. He was bound to fill a good
deal of his space with the seventeenth-century religious writers. He
does not overlook South; and he gives a numerous and glittering selection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
from Milton, one of the few English writers who have contrived to
keep their singing-robes about them, with whatever effort, when writing
about every sort of mundane subject. He has found almost everything that
he could have wanted in the writers of the eighteenth century, and he gives
many perfect passages from Coleridge, Shelley, Keats, and Landor. But to
some of the Victorian writers, and to some of our contemporaries (though
he has quarried some exquisite things from unlikely places) he does, if he
will allow me to say so, less than justice. We could have spared some of the
eleven pages of Emerson for the sake of some of the best paragraphs of
Ruskin, who is given only two pages. The single extract from Cardinal
Newman (whose <i>Idea of a University</i> should have been searched) does not
represent him, and no single extract could. There are two&mdash;there might
well have been more&mdash;extracts from Mr. Doughty's <i>Wanderings in Arabia</i>.
The passage from Samuel Butler is more sustained than Butler's wont, but
scarcely worthy of inclusion, though the reader would appreciate in any
surroundings his last sentence, "I am not very fond of Milton, but I admit
that he does at times put me in mind of Fleet Street." Mr. Shaw appears
and Henry James; there are good extracts from Mr. Santayana and Mr.
Lowes Dickinson. But Mr. Conrad's works&mdash;both his Reminiscences and
his novels&mdash;should have yielded many more than two pieces, and some
admirable modern writers of coloured, musical, and affecting prose are
omitted altogether. Mr. Hardy is a curious omission. Mr. Chesterton, as a
rule, troubles too little to be a good subject for this anthologist; the journalist
and the tumbler are always breaking in; the poet appears arm-in-arm with the
politician, an exasperating contiguity. But I think that exploration would
have been rewarded even had our collector gone no farther than the splendid
last pages of <i>The Short History of England</i>. From Mr. Hudson's books,
especially from <i>A Crystal Age</i> and <i>Far Away and Long Ago</i>, passages, I think,
could have been taken which would have competed respectably with many
that are here; Mrs. Meynell's essays and Mr. Bertrand Russell's last book
should be drawn on; and where is Mr. Belloc? Rupert Brooke said that
Mr. Belloc had a better prose style than any man alive. I should not dispute
that: it is a clear, a precise, an economical style that serves admirably
all the diverse uses to which its owner puts it. And it often rises, always
quietly, where some poignant thing is clearly seen, into sentences of noble
beauty. These are liable to occur almost anywhere; for instance, in a
digression during an article on strategy. Possibly because he began his career
with public facetiousness about "purple patches" he often seems to allow
a promising passage to break its back because he will not seem artificial or
affected. He fetters his consciously-exercised powers and he can seldom let
himself go, as it were, unconsciously. In his books it would therefore be far
more easy to find short passages than long ones of the kind included in this
anthology; for any other sort of prose anthology his work should be thoroughly
ransacked. Nevertheless there are long ones. My memory is that there are
certainly several in <i>The Four Men</i> and in the books of essays. To hunt for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
examples which one will have no room to quote would be tiresome; there is
a long passage in <i>The Absence of the Past</i> which begins:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There was a woman of charming vivacity, whose eyes were ever ready for laughter,
and whose tone of address of itself provoked the noblest of replies. Many loved her;
all admired. She passed (I will suppose) by this street or by that; she sat at table in
such and such a house; Gainsborough painted her; and all that time ago there were
men who had the luck to meet her and to answer her laughter with their own. And
the house where she moved is there, and the street in which she walked, and the very
furniture she used and touched with her hands you may touch with your hands.
You shall come into the rooms she inhabited, and there you shall see her portrait, all
light and movement and grace and beatitude.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">But it is a stupid thing to spend much time talking about the omissions from
a good book; only less so than it would be to complain that it is one sort of
book and not another sort. Mr. Pearsall Smith set out to collect prose
passages of a certain, the most poetical and resounding, kind; and he has
made an admirable and a learned choice. A perusal of his specimens confirms
in me an opinion previously formed as to the nature of this kind of prose in
English. It is that we have a canonical style for such prose, and that such
prose most frequently arises from meditation on a definable kind of subject.</p>

<p>In great writers and small, in those whose prose marches always with
majesty and in those with whom eloquence is infrequent, in the graceful
and the ungainly, in the magisterial and the familiar, this thing is to be
discerned: that their prose is least personal when at its highest flights.
The observation is common that we have in England no standard and
accepted prose style, but a medley of manners which are continually
increasing in number. This is true. But it has not been generally noticed
that amongst those passages of English prose, drawn from authors of all our
literary ages, which are received as being the most sublime and the most
musical&mdash;passages which have been, and must be, the first resort of all
anthologists of our prose who are in search of those attributes of power and
beauty&mdash;there is a strong likeness of form and feature. There is more: the
resemblance is often so close that the differences, normally marked, between
the styles of writers divided by a great gulf of time are in such sentences
not to be distinguished. Styles so various on the lower plane meet, as it
were, on the higher: there is an established, an inevitable, manner into which
an Englishman will rise when his ideas and images lift into grandeur. It
is the style of the Authorised Version, a style in process of formation long
before the date of that Parthenon of our prose, but reaching in that its
perfection, and by means of that made an element of the air we breathe, and
many generations before us have breathed, in childhood. Even in writers
who never entirely lose the marks of their eccentricity the most eloquent
"purple patches" are always reminiscent. Emotion deepens suddenly, or
reaches an expected climax; the results of reflection are summarised; by
whatever route, the author comes to a place at which his expression assumes
a sublimity of imagery and a perfection of rhythm; and with the emotion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
he communicates is always mingled the throe of recognition. The note has
been struck and a hundred neighbouring strings respond. The writer has
stepped off the common road and into that chapel where there is one ritual
and one mode of incantation. "Man that is born of a woman, hath but a
short time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is cut down like
a flower; he fleeth as it were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay."
It is the Prayer-Book of 1549. "Thou hast drawn together all the far-stretched
greatness, all the pride, cruelty, and ambition of man, and covered
it all over with these two narrow words, <i>Hic jacit</i>." It is Sir Walter Raleigh.
"These wait upon the shore of death, and waft unto him to draw near,
wishing above all others to see his star that they might be led to his place;
wooing the remorseless Sisters to wind down the watch of their life, and to
break them off before the hour." It is Bacon. "A memory of yesterday's
pleasures, a fear of to-morrow's dangers, a straw under my knee, a noise in
mine ear, a light in mine eye, an anything, a nothing, a fancy, a chimera in
my brain, troubles me in my prayer." It is John Donne. "Methusalem,
with all his hundreds of years, was but a mushroom of a night's growth to
this day; and all the four Monarchies, with all their thousands of years, and
all the powerful Kings, and all the beautiful Queens of this world, were but
as a bed of flowers, some gathered at six, some at seven, some at eight&mdash;all
in one morning in respect of this day." That too is Donne, and his subject
Eternity. "Since the brother of Death daily haunts us with dying
Mementoes, and Time that grows old itself bids us hope no long duration,
diuturnity is a dream and folly of expectation." That is Sir Thomas
Browne. "They that three thousand years agone died unwillingly, and
stopped death two days, or stayed it a week, what is their gain? Where is
that week?" That is Jeremy Taylor. "When all is done, human life is, at
the greatest and the best, but like a froward child, that must be played with
and humoured a little to keep it quiet, till it falls asleep, and then the care
is over." That is Sir William Temple. "The present is a fleeting moment,
the past is no more; and our prospect of futurity is dark and doubtful."
That is Gibbon. "The stars that still sojourn, yet still move onward; and
everywhere the blue sky belongs to them, and is their appointed rest and
their native country and their natural homes, which they enter unannounced,
as lords that are certainly expected, and yet there is a silent joy at their
arrival." The argument to the <i>Ancient Mariner</i> needs no specification.
"Laodameia died; Helen died; Leda, the beloved of Jupiter, went before.
It is better to repose in the earth betimes than to sit up late; better, than to
cling pertinaciously to what we feel crumbling under us, and to protract
an inevitable fall." That is from a dialogue of Landor's. "And it would not
taste of death, by reason of its adoption into immortal palaces; but it was
to know weakness, and reliance, and the shadow of human imbecility; and
it went with a lame gait; but in its goings it exceeded all mortal children in
grace and swiftness." That is Charles Lamb. "In her sight there was
Elysium; her smile was heaven; her voice was enchantment; the air of love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
waved round her, breathing balm into my heart: for a little while I had sat
with the gods at their golden tables, I had tasted of all earth's bliss." They
have quoted that passage from Hazlitt's <i>Liber Amoris</i> a thousand times.
"Like God, whose servants they are, they utter their pleasure not by sounds
that perish, or by words that go astray, but by signs in heaven, by changes
on earth, by pulses in secret rivers, heraldries painted on darkness, and
hieroglyphics written on the tablets of the brain." That is de Quincey.
"And again the sun blinks out, and the poor sower is casting his grain into
the furrow, hopeful he that the Zodiacs and far Heavenly Horologes have
not faltered; that there will be yet another summer added for us and another
harvest." That is Carlyle. "To what port are we bound? Who knows?
There is no one to tell us but such poor weather tossed mariners as ourselves,
whom we speak as we pass, or who have hoisted some signal, or
floated to us some letter in a bottle from far." It is from Emerson.
"Not to discriminate every moment some passionate attitude in
those about us, and in the brilliancy of their gifts some tragic
dividing of forces on their ways, is, on this short day of frost and
sun, to sleep before evening." That, if modern in conception, altogether
traditional in cadence and in the phrasing of its close, is from Pater's
<i>Renaissance</i>. "We can therefore be happy in our sorrows, happy even in the
death of our beloved who fall in the fight; for they die nobly, as heroes and
saints die, with hearts and hands unstained by hatred and wrong." A
peroration: the peroration from the Poet Laureate's <i>Spirit of Man</i>. "And
in the autumn before the snows come they have all gone&mdash;of all that incalculable
abundance of life, of all that hope and adventure, excitement and
deliciousness there is scarcely more to be found than a soiled twig, a dirty
seed, a dead leaf, black mould or a rotting feather." Mr. H. G. Wells, never
a careful artist or fully aware of what language can be, permits himself some
looseness in the phraseology of the passage from which that sentence comes,
but he too falls, as it were unwittingly, into the old music. And here, from
another living author is a piece of declamation which contains, indeed,
sentiments and words which would have been foreign to the seventeenth
century, but is a true child of its loins:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>We survey the past, and see that its history is of blood and tears, of helpless blundering,
of wild revolt, of stupid acquiescence, of empty aspirations. We sound the future,
and learn that after a period, long compared with the individual life, but short indeed
compared with the divisions of time open to our investigation, the energies of our
system will decay, the glory of the sun will be dimmed, and the earth, tideless and
inert, will no longer tolerate the race which has for a moment disturbed its solitude.
Man will go down into the pit, and all his thoughts will perish. The uneasy consciousness,
which in this obscure corner has for a brief space broken the contented
silence of the universe, will be at rest. Matter will know itself no longer. "Imperishable
monuments" and "immortal deeds," death itself, and love stronger than death,
will be as though they had never been. Nor will anything that is be better or be worse
for all that the labour, genius, devotion, and suffering of man have striven through
countless generations to effect.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">This passage, summarising the conclusions that natural science unaided
has been able to reach, is detached from a longer one: it occurs in Mr.
Balfour's <i>The Foundations of Belief</i>.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>There is one music and one speech in all these extracts. It is not the result
of deliberation, but it is not an accident, that they have so much else in
common, that their very subjects are analogous. Chosen, however genuinely,
at random and without afterthought, if they are chosen from the best, they
will be variations on but a few related themes and half of them will be inspired
by the direct contemplation of death. There are innumerable subjects which
engage the attention, and they may be seen in countless aspects; but that
large utterance comes chiefly to English lips when things, of whatever nature
they may be, are regarded <i>sub specie æternitatis</i>. Whatever a man's philosophy
and whatever his mood, when he speaks with this music, he speaks with the
voice of mankind, awed and saddened by its inscrutable destiny. Time,
Death, Eternity, Mutability: those words, the most awful that we know,
insistently recur. It is they, unuttered yet present, which give their
grandeur to pronouncements of many kinds which do not relate directly to
the general operations of Time or of Death: to Burke's passage on Marie
Antoinette, to Johnson's Preface to his Dictionary, to Gibbon's moonlight
reverie on the conclusion of his History. Those names, those figures with
their skirts of thunder and doom, trail through all our literature with a
majesty that no others possess. Apostrophising those our shadowy tyrants,
celebrating them, rebelling against them, we may clothe our conceptions in
many images, though even here, for the most part, we must observe a
tendency, natural and spontaneous, to choose as tokens and ornaments a few,
in the earthly sense, universal and perennial things. But those shapes tower
over our whole world. Anything we look at in the sunlight, a wave, a weed,
a travelling insect, may be like a window opening out to them; and at night,
under the dark sky, so actual and so symbolical, the reflective man is always
aware of them. We have our activities and our distractions. We must satisfy
our carnal cravings, eat, drink, and sleep; between birth and death, under
that immense and unresponsive heaven, we build and dig, hunt and dance,
carve and paint, intrigue, copulate and kill. But whenever the moment comes
that we turn round from our toys it is one spectacle that we see: life proceeding
from darkness to darkness, change, dissolution, and death. And
the greatest utterance of our tongue is a chronicle, again and again resumed
and repeated, of the wonder and dread, the certain regret and the wavering
hope which that spectacle arouses in hearts which have immortal longings
but have loved transient things: a chronicle of grass that withers, leaves
that fall, of girls like flowers who fade like flowers, of conquerors who are
dust, blown about, of tough oaks that decay, of stone temples and pyramids
that as surely, after a few more years, fall into dust, of the world's past,
and the past of the individual which cannot be recovered, the innocence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
and the illusions of childhood, the loss of which typifies all loss and their
beauty that Eden to which, with the shadow approaching, we pitifully aspire:
all framed by the most abiding things that our senses know, the sea and the
wind and the hills, the seasons which come for all generations in their order,
the stars, constant, silent, vigilant over all: those also transitory after their
own kind, arching to their fall in epochs beyond our computation or guessing,
but in relation to us steadfast and immutable.</p>

<p>They say (though I do not believe it) that an age, even if it be still far
distant, is coming in which the present preoccupations of man, both physical
and mental, will have vanished and new passions and new hopes will have
taken their place. Our contact with each other is as yet imperfect; psychological
discovery is only beginning; the gates between mind and mind will
all be broken down; it will not be a question of universal candour but of
automatic communication and sympathy. The individual will be identified
with the race, will live only in the life of the race, will not merely not fear
but will not even think about any death which does not involve the death
of the race. The race will be one animal; its members, sloughed and replaced,
will want no more immortality than that qualified perpetuation which the
race can give; no two persons will be more to each other than any other two;
Man will really be Man and will cease to be men. Should that time come
(which, speaking diffidently, it will not) the voice of Man may change.
His most eloquent words may be other than they are now, and even though,
in his corporate form, he is still most deeply stirred by frustrations that we
cannot conjecture, the range of his imagery will have altered, he will have
new symbols for his regrets, and new comparisons for his ideas. Pending
that change there is no reason to suppose that the essential, or to a large
extent the incidental, material of our poetry, or of such of our prose as
aspires to the condition of poetry, will substantially alter. We speak most
sublimely of what moves us most deeply.</p>

<p>But this is not to say that we should wish that such speech, at the cost of
such experience, should be more than intermittent. Sun, sheep, and children
may take a sober colouring from the eye that has been much busied with
such watchings, but they were not put there solely for that purpose; even
if we profess ignorance of the reasons for their existence, we shall employ
ourselves better if we act on the assumption that they were not. The last
word, after so prolonged a meditation on the incomprehensible, may lie with
Stevenson who, not unaccustomed to the thought of death and not incapable
of poetry, wrote an essay on the subject which might not supply passages
"distilled" enough for this book, but contains many so sensible that they
might well be reprinted in others. "The changes wrought by death," he
said, "are in themselves so sharp and final, and so terrible and melancholy
in their consequences, that the thing stands alone in man's experience, and
has no parallel upon earth." That opening might have led to a piece of great
orchestral prose; but he turned on himself and wrote instead some pages of
cheerful colloquial prose, sprinkled with fine sentences. In all views and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
situations "there is but one conclusion possible: that a man should stop his
ears against paralysing terror, and run the race that is set before him with a
single mind"; and "as a matter of fact, although few things are spoken of
with more fearful whisperings than this prospect of death, few have less
influence on conduct under healthy circumstances." But notice, even in
this essay, the old lift, the old attitude, the old accents, when momentarily
he looks out over the other wall: "Into what great waters, not to be crossed
by any swimmer, God's pale Prætorian throws us over in the end!"</p>

<h2>A COLLECTION OF AUTOGRAPHS</h2>

<p class="center">By CANON N. EGERTON LEIGH</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">MY</span> collection of autographs was begun by Lady Sitwell, of
Rempstone, who married, 1798, Sir Sitwell Sitwell, Bt., M.P.,
who died in 1811. She married secondly, as his second wife,
my grandfather in 1821, and died in 1860. Lady Sitwell knew
everybody, and entertained a good deal. She was a blue-stocking in the days
of their power, and most of the letters were written to her by the eminent
men and women of the day. But her friends supplied her with other autographs&mdash;for
instance, Longfellow sends her George Washington and
Benjamin Franklyn. The following remarks by Washington are interesting
at the present time: "At the beginning of the late war with Great Britain,
when we thought ourselves justifiable in resisting to blood, it was known to
those best acquainted with the different conditions of the combatants and
the probable cost of the prize in dispute that the expense in comparison
with our circumstances as Colonists must be enormous, the struggle protracted,
dubious, and severe. It was known that the resources of Britain
were, in a manner, inexhaustible, that her fleet covered the Ocean, and that
her troops had harvested laurels in every quarter of the globe. Not then
organised as a nation, or known as a people upon the earth, we had no
preparation. Money, the nerve of war, was wanting. The sword was to be
forged on the anvil of necessity: the treasury to be created from nothing.
If we had a secret resource unknown to our enemy, it was in the unconquerable
resolution of our citizens, the conscious rectitude of our cause,
and a confident trust that we should not be forsaken by Heaven. The people
willingly offered themselves to the battle, but the means of arming, clothing,
and subsisting them, as well as of procuring the implements of hostility, were
only to be found in anticipations of our future wealth. Paper bills of credit
were emitted, monies borrowed for the most pressing emergencies, and our
brave troops in the field unpaid for their services. In this manner, Peace,
attended with every circumstance that could gratify our reasonable desires,
or even inflate us with ideas of national importance, was at length obtained.
But a load of debt was left upon us. The fluctuations of, and speculations in,
our paper currency had, but in too many instances, occasioned vague ideas
of property, generated licentious appetites, and corrupted the morals of men.
To these immediate consequences of a fluctuating medium of commerce
may be joined a tide of circumstances that flowed together from sources
mostly opened during and after the war. The ravage of farms, the conflagrations
of towns, the diminution&mdash;&mdash;" Here the MSS. abruptly stops,
but we can imagine what would follow.</p>

<p>Mr. Herrick, of Beaumanor Park, gave Lady Sitwell the earliest autograph
in the collection, a letter of Robert Herrick from St. John's, Cambridge,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
which I lent to the late Professor Moorman for his life of Robert Herrick.
A curious entry in his uncle's account books discloses the fact that while the
impecunious student was finding infinite difficulty in obtaining his quarterly
allowance of £10, the wealthy uncle was borrowing hundreds of pounds
from the nephew. I pass on to a letter of Lord Byron's accepting an invitation
to dinner with Lady Sitwell. In it he says, "The song you have been good
enough to send had escaped my observation or my memory when in Greece.
I will endeavour to comply with your request. The copy has a few errors
which I will try to expunge, though I have nearly forgotten my Romaic.
I believe the words should be thus arranged." He arranges them, and then
sends her, doubtless knowing her penchant for autographs, the following
lines:</p>

<p>Another manuscript, to which an especial interest attaches at this time,
is the following letter from George Eliot:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="sigright">

16 Blandford Square, London, N.W.<br />
</p>

<p>My dear Friend&mdash;I was delighted to have your letter this morning bringing me
good news not only of a literary but of a personal kind. It is pleasant to know that
your labours on <i>Adam</i> have been so far appreciated; but I think it is pleasanter still
to know that Maman has had the comfort of seeing her son Charles this Christmas,
and that your prospects concerning him are hopeful. I begin, you know, to consider
myself an experienced matron, knowing a great deal about parental joys and anxieties.
Indeed I have rather too ready a talent for entering into anxieties of all sorts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
Mr. Lewes is very much obliged to you for sending him the prospectus and additional
information, which he has already dispatched to Mr. Trollope. It will be a valuable
widening of his opportunities for choosing a foreign school. I was not aware till I
gathered the fact from your letter that Emile Forgues had "analysed" the <i>Mill</i> for
the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>, for Mr. Lewes, knowing that it would vex me, had carefully
concealed it. It is an impudent way of getting money&mdash;this cool appropriation
of other people's property without leave asked&mdash;which seems to have become a
regular practice with him. Pray consider me responsible for nothing but what you
find in the Tauchnitz edition. I <i>never</i> alter my books after they are printed&mdash;never
alter anything of importance even in the course of printing, and <i>ce n'est point mon
histoire que j'écris</i>, or whatever else you may find in M. Forgues' edition that is not in
the English is due to the gratuitous exercise of his own talents in improving my book.
I can well imagine that you find the <i>Mill</i> more difficult to render than <i>Adam</i>, but
would it be inadmissible to represent in French, at least in some degree, those <i>intermédiaires
entre le style commun et le style élégant</i> to which you refer? It seems to me
that I have discerned such shades very strikingly rendered in Balzac, and occasionally
in George Sand. Balzac, I think, dares to be thoroughly congenial, in spite of French
strait-lacing. Even in English this daring is far from being general: inferior writers
are hardly ever capable of it, and in the great mass of English fiction, from Bulwer
down to the latest young lady scribbler, you find scarcely anything but impossible
dialogue&mdash;the character speaking as no man or woman ever spoke, except on the
stage. The writers who dare to be thoroughly familiar are Shakespeare, Fielding,
Scott (when he is representing the popular life with which he is familiar), and indeed
every other writer of fiction of the first class. Even in his loftiest tragedies, in <i>Hamlet</i>,
for example, Shakespeare is intensely colloquial. One hears the very accent of
living men. I am not vindicating the practice, I know that is not necessary to <i>you</i>
who have so quick a sensibility for the real and the humorous, but I want to draw
your attention to what you may not have observed&mdash;the timid elegance (<i>alias</i> unnaturalness)
of inferior English writers. You may not have observed it, because
naturally you don't read our poorer literature. You, of course, have knowledge as to
what is or can be done in French literature beyond any that my reading can have
furnished me with. I am glad that you think there are any readers who will prefer the
<i>Mill</i> to <i>Adam</i>. To my feeling there is more thought and a profounder veracity in the
<i>Mill</i> than in <i>Adam</i>: but <i>Adam</i> is more complete and better balanced. My love of the
childhood scenes made me linger over them in epic fashion, so that I could not
develop as fully as I wished the concluding "Book" in which the tragedy occurs,
and which I had looked forward to with much intention and preparation from the
beginning. My books don't seem to belong to me after I have once written them, so
I find myself delivering opinions about them as if I had nothing to do with them.
I am not afraid that you will be unable to distinguish that frankness from conceit.
I cannot write very boastfully about our health; both Mr. Lewes and I are very
middling, easily upset, easily put out of order. But in all other respects our happiness
grows daily. Our dear boy Charles is more and more precious to us, and seems to
delight in pouring all his young affection out in tenderness to me. Thornton, the
second, is going on well and happily with his studies at Edinburgh, and seems to
have profited morally and physically by the change. I don't know how to describe
our locality otherwise than by saying that it lies very near Regent's Park, <i>westward</i>.
It is a quiet situation for London&mdash;alas, not quiet for me, who dream of still fields!
London is hateful to me, and I sometimes think we shall hardly have come to stay in
it three years. Mr. Lewes and I constantly recall Geneva&mdash;and for us Geneva means
all that is associated with you and Maman. It was a vivid pleasure to me that he felt
his liking and admiration go out to you both quite apart from the fact that you were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">323</a></span>
<i>my</i> friends. He desires to share in all assurances of affection that I send you. But I
send you few assurances. Are they necessary?</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Houghton once said that "the Personal is always the interesting."
This gives one of the great interests to a collection of autographs, it illustrates
the Personal. Take Tennyson's. There is not one word in a long letter to
show that he was Poet Laureate. He begins with "Trouble not yourself
about the half-crown. I am very glad to pay my debts, however small, tho'
Milnes asserts that nothing under five shillings should ever be refunded....
It is not all ladies who would have tolerated my fumigation so
mildly; forgive my seeming roughness at parting; there is something in the
farewell shake of hands that often breaks me down and makes me seem other
than I am." My letter from Rudyard Kipling has in it the sentence, "<i>I</i> was
a chorister once, but somehow they managed to agree to get on without me
after a while." Samuel Smiles, of <i>Self-Help</i>, etc., writes, 1891, "I think
nothing the less of you because you are a Dominie. You have a great mission
for training the intellects and hearts of the coming generation. I hope you
are kind to the children. My Dominie, he was a hard man, though he had
favourites; told me I was only fit 'to sweep the streets of my native borough,'
and threatened to 'dash my brains against the wall.' This was his ordinary
way of speaking of those who were not his favourites. But I understand that
he became better as he grew older. Still he left a very bad taste in my mouth."
Leigh Hunt writes a kind letter to a budding poet with the postscript, "Send
your sonnets by all means to periodicals, but have no mercy in them on
superfluous words." With equal kindness Southey writes to Mr. Ragg in
1835, "I do not remember to have seen a more beautiful little piece than
'Why Does the Sun Go Down?' It ought to find its way into all popular
selections." Southey wrote out for Lady Sitwell, in 1813, "The March to
Moscow." From these kindly letters let us turn to Robert Lowe: "I am a
candidate for the Greek Professorship of Glasgow ... a most excellent
appointment, and one which above all I should be anxious to obtain....
My chance is not a bad one, as there is no candidate with whom they are
content, and to me there is no objection except my politics, and they are, you
know, not very furious or indeed in any way practical principles to me....
This is the fairest chance that has ever offered to me of making
myself independent and affluent for the rest of my life. It is one of the few
appointments I am able to fill." This was written in 1838. In 1851 he writes
to the same person, "I am a candidate for the Chair of Political Economy
at Oxford. I have every hope of success as my reception in Oxford has been
very flattering.... The contest seems to lie between me and Neate
of Oriel, a very good man, I believe, but not very popular." Another politician,
John Bright, wrote in 1865, "I fear it would not suit your object for
any Englishman to interfere in the course that may be taken in reference to
Jeff Davis. I have privately said all I can or ought to say, and from what I
hear I incline to think that he will escape the punishment which so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
men have suffered for crimes of infinitely less guilt. I am opposed to capital
punishment for political or social crimes." Autographs from Prime Ministers
include the Duke of Portland, "Your Parishioner named Bradley tried to
usurp one of my houses. I do not consider that an amiable weakness," and
Lord Salisbury, <i>La Donna e Mobile</i>, given to a lady during an important
conversation, when she asked for his autograph. Lord Rosebery heads his
letter "Waterloo Day." Mr. Gladstone shows his kindly feeling for Sir
Stafford Northcote, but from Melbourne onwards the Prime Ministers
content themselves with few words. So does Thackeray, "Dear Sir or Madam&mdash;Where
does Mr. Ritchie live with whom I dine in 2 hours. Please
tell." John Hay says "our visit to Eton will be for Helen and me one
of our pleasantest memories of England." Eton is again mentioned by Mr.
Justice Coleridge writing to his relation there, one of the masters, "I should
like very much to know whether there is any prospect of the College making
any movement towards changes." Eton does not like changes; to parody
Lord Curzon's motto, "Let Eton hold what Eton held," is as true now
as in the past. I will conclude with a pathetic letter from Matthew Arnold,
"I lead such a bothered and hard-driven life that I forget what I wrote in
better days." I wonder if he remembered writing in an autograph book:</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> Christie-Miller sale at Messrs. Sotheby's, postponed from November 28th

doubling the previous "record" for a single day's book-sale achieved at the
Yates-Thompson sale last summer, the total of which was £52,000. The
great majority of the items were acquired by Mr. G. D. Smith, the American
buyer, who seemed to have learnt to think so imperially about book prices that very
few English dealers or collectors were able to compete with him. For the most part
the bidding resolved itself into a duel between Mr. Smith and Mr. Quaritch, Mr. Smith
being almost invariably the victor.</p>

by J. D. (Sir John Davies) and C. M. (Christopher Marlowe). The <i>Venus and Adonis</i>
is the only copy known of the fourth edition of the poem; six copies of the first three
editions exist, all of which are in public libraries. <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i> is one of the
three known copies of the first edition (1599), while only two or three copies are

<p>This sale marks the triumph and the reduction to the absurd of book-collecting.
The absurdity of picture-dealing is already manifest; prices have long ceased to have
the least relation to the merit of the work purchased. It is out of mere <i>snobisme</i> and not
from any love of art that people will give fifty thousand pounds for a picture by a
second-rate eighteenth-century artist. The same spirit has invaded the book-collecting
world. The amateur who collects books out of a genuine love of literature had better
retire as gracefully as he may. There is no place for him in the topsy-turvy universe
where fifteen thousand pounds is paid for a little volume of poems. One left the sale
with a curious feeling of bewilderment and indignation, almost vowing that one would
never look at an old book again.</p>

<p>The centenary of George Eliot was celebrated at Messrs. Hodgsons' by the sale of a
first edition of <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i>, a fine uncut copy. It went for £17. The library of
the late James Nicol Dunn was disposed of at the same rooms. Mr. Dunn was
a journalist whose career included the editorship of the <i>Morning Post</i> and that of the
<i>Johannesburg Star</i>. In earlier years&mdash;he always retained some flavour of that association&mdash;he
was Henley's assistant on the <i>National Observer</i>. He was thus in a position to
obtain books, manuscripts, and autograph letters which have since become valuable.
His Edinburgh set of Stevenson (accompanied by a note from Charles Baxter, "Louis
will have nett complete about £5200 over this") went for £65, and a set of the <i>Scots
Observer</i> and <i>National Observer</i> for £47. An inscribed copy of Whistler's <i>Gentle Art of
Making Enemies</i> sold for ten guineas, and three first editions, with letters, of John
Davidson £5&mdash;which suggests that Davidson is at last getting a little notice from
collectors.</p>

<p>Among the autographs were several corrected proofs and typescripts of Mr. Kipling's.
A freely corrected typescript of <i>Tomlinson</i> fetched £81, the MS. of <i>Fuzzy-Wuzzy</i> £50.
Three manuscript poems of Henley's, with a letter from Mr. Yeats thrown in, brought
only £6 10<i>s.</i> Still more surprising was the sale of Mr. Yeats's MS. of <i>The Lake Isle of
Innisfree</i>, with another, for £5 15<i>s.</i> In a sale on the following day a first edition of <i>The

<p>The Arbury Library, a portion of which is to be sold at Sotheby's on January 22nd,
has an interest apart from the high rarity of many of the books which are to be sold;
for these found their way to Arbury, not at the fancy of any individual collector of rare
volumes&mdash;none of the Newdigates have been great book-collectors in this modern sense&mdash;but
simply as current literature of the period in which they were published. The
First Folio Shakespeare, for instance, which is described as "probably the largest
available," has been at Arbury since 1660, when it belonged to Serjeant Newdegate,
who was Chief Justice under Cromwell and was made a Baronet at the Restoration;
and it is likely that it came into his possession or into that of the elder brother whom he
succeeded soon after its publication in 1623. Sir Richard Newdegate's mother was
Anne Fitton, sister to Mary Fitton, Queen Elizabeth's frolicsome and wayward maid-of-honour,
whom a modern edition of Shakespeare's Sonnets has sought to identify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
with the Dark Lady. Family papers at Arbury give no support to the late Mr. Tyler's
theory, and Mary Fitton's portraits there show her to have been fair rather than dark.
It is probable that some of the volumes which are to be sold at Sotheby's were at
Arbury when Mary Fitton found a home there with her sister, Lady Newdigate, after
her disgrace at Court. No one whose interest in old books lies in their character, their
history, and their associations rather than in the price which they may fetch under the
hammer can fail to regret the fate by which these precious volumes are at length taken
from the home in which they have stood side by side for some three centuries.</p>

<p>Sounds unheard are the sweetest, and the books that were never written and the
books that once existed and have been lost are by far the world's best books. Those
chapters on Chambermaids and Buttonholes would have been the most amusing in
<i>Tristram Shandy</i>; Milton's epic on King Arthur, great and glorious in itself, would
also have nipped <i>The Idylls of the King</i> in the bud, thus earning our gratitude as well as
our admiration. The lost books of the <i>Satyricon</i> were the best things Petronius ever
wrote, and the vanished poems of Sappho&mdash;one dare not think of them.</p>

<p>And now we have news of yet another little work that has joined the great army of
the lost. But not, we hope, for ever; for the volume can hardly fail to turn up some time,
sooner or later, in some bookseller's shop or some collector's library. The history of this
lost volume is not uninteresting, and we propose to quote at some length from an
account of it furnished by the owner, Miss E. M. Green, of Modbury, Ivy Bridge,
South Devon:</p>

<p>"In 1913 a MS. book fell into my hands, thought first to be a manuscript of Little
Gidding, which proved, however, to be the work of the Rev. Richard White, Chaplain
to the English nuns of St. Monica in Louvain from 1630 to 1687. This I published
with Messrs. Longmans under the title of <i>Celestial Fire</i>. This volume contains in the
preface an account of these Louvain Manuscripts, which are singularly beautiful
specimens of seventeenth-century script. Consequent on this publication, the community
of St. Augustine's Priory, Newton Abbot, who fled to England during the
French Revolution, sent me a similar manuscript, <i>Cordial Prayer</i>, to be published also.
It was a leather volume, 4 inches by 2¾ inches, 1 inch in depth, bound in holland with
quaint brass clasps, and the top of the pages was a beautiful blue. Taking it from the
inspection of the Keeper of MSS., British Museum, and from the MSS. Room home
with me, I found on entering an omnibus in Sloane Street that I had lost it. It was tied
in white paper with my address on the outside."</p>

<p>All efforts have so far, Miss Green tells us, proved unavailing, and no word can be
heard of the lost volume. Perhaps some of our readers may have seen or heard of this
interesting little manuscript.</p>

the last pages set up, still in place. A small collection of some of the more
interesting books printed on it has been arranged on an adjoining table.</p>

<p>We recently had the fortune to come across a copy of that very interesting edition
of Louise Labé's works, published at Lyons in 1824. Printed at the expense of a local
literary society, the edition was limited to 600 copies, a number of which were printed
on coloured paper. Our copy was one of the four "coquille rose." One copy exists in
which the colour of the paper varies at every sheet.</p>

<p>There are moments when one's literary sense gets the better of one's purely bibliophilous
instinct&mdash;moments when a profound irritation seizes one that people should
be so stupid as to collect books because they are rare and not because they are worth
reading. One wonders, for instance, if human labour and ingenuity might not be
expended in some more profitable undertaking than the compilation of a catalogue of
about one hundred-and-fifty editions of <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i>, bibliographically
described. Collectors of the works of that second-rate literary man who was the author
of this <i>Dorian Gray</i> may be interested to hear that this catalogue is at present being
prepared at "The Bungalow," 8 Abercorn Place, London, N.W.8, where they will also
find a number of Wilde's books, in every kind and shape of edition, for sale.</p>

in 1896, and may be bought for two guineas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In your admirable columns on <i>Bibliography</i> A. L. H. writes (November issue):
"It is interesting to note what high prices the works of Surtees can always
command." They certainly do; but is it not Leech rather than Surtees who gives them
their value?</p>

<p><i>Handley Cross</i> is doubtless immortal because of the creation of Jorrocks and James
Pigg, the best portrait of the hard-riding, reckless, witty Northumbrian since Shakespeare's
<i>Hotspur</i>, but <i>Plain or Ringlets</i>, <i>Ask Mamma</i>, and the rest are surely only
valuable on account of Leech's illustrations?</p>

<p>I imagine that the original <i>Handley Cross</i>, in three volumes, 1843, London, will not
fetch as much as the later and expanded <i>Handley Cross</i>, with Leech's illustrations,
published London, 1854.</p>

<p>I have recently inherited a set of the five Surtees-cum-Leech issue (usually styled
first editions), and I am in doubt as to what to insure them for in view of the present high
prices.</p>

<p>Still more so in the case of other still greater treasures: early Aldines, Jensons, first
editions Jonson, Spencer, Milton, etc., but above and beyond all in the case of a first
folio Shakespeare, a splendid copy and intact.</p>

<p>According to Sir Sidney Lee, out of 140 known copies twenty only are "perfect"
(with Shakespeare's portrait <i>printed</i> on title-page), other twenty are intact (with portrait
<i>inlaid</i>), and the remaining 100 are all deficient in one way or another.</p>

<p>Well, suppose by some dreadful dispensation my library was burned down and this
gem consumed, what would it cost to procure another?</p>

<h3 class="b0">AMERICAN POETRY</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;The writer of your "Letter from America," in the December number, commits
himself to the astonishing statement that "Mr. Nicholas Vachel Lindsay is the one
American writer of verse whose work shows signs of genius." Such a statement should
not pass unchallenged. It is as if an American writer, visiting England, were to remark
that Mr. Rudyard Kipling is the only English writer of verse with signs of genius.
The parallel is quite exact. Lindsay has the same free-and-easy facility, the same preference
for ragtime rhythms, the same tone of vulgar optimism, the same desire to preach
a gospel, as the author of <i>Mandalay</i>. The only difference is that Lindsay is rather more
limited in his range, if anything. He has never succeeded in doing but one type of
poem&mdash;the ragtime exhortation. To say that he and he alone in America shows genius
is preposterous.</p>

<p>What about Robert Frost, whose work and influence were paramount in the development
of Edward Thomas?&mdash;a fact admitted by a recent biographer. What about Edwin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
Arlington Robinson, a poet who comes nearer to Hardy than anyone in America?
What about Conrad Aiken, Carl Sandburg, Wallace Stevens, Alfred Kreymborg,
Maxwell Bodenheim? All of these authors have shown signs of genius, each in an entirely
different and quite individual way. They have not repeated themselves into tedious
stereotype as the magazine writers of <i>vers libre</i>, or as Mr. Lindsay has. Without any
desire to belittle Mr. Lindsay's clever but superficial talent, I should respectfully suggest
to "R. E. C." that some of his remarks about the conventionality of American writers
apply very strongly to Lindsay. They do not apply to the men I have just mentioned.&mdash;Yours,

<p>In the second chapter of Forster's <i>Life of Dickens</i>, among some notes on the hardships
of Dickens' childhood, the novelist himself thus describes a coffee shop in St. Martin's
Lane: "In the door there was an oval glass-plate, with COFFEE ROOM painted on
it.... If I ever find myself in a very different kind of coffee-room now, but
where there is such an inscription on glass, and read it backward on the wrong side

(2) a criticism, and (3) a query.</p>

<p>1. Major and minor Elizabethan and "Georgian" poets receive full and correct
designation. Could not the same be spared for Canon Ottley, of Oxford, who on p. 128<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
appears as <i>Attley</i>? It might be granted in recognition of his Chancellor's Prize for
Latin Verse, the award of which demands, I imagine, a certain measure of poetical
feeling in addition to the mathematically stressed rhythms of our schooldays.</p>

<p>2. There may be subtle and political humour intended in the word <i>dignatories</i>
(p. 236), but with my last breath I would protest the better (and only) spelling to be
"dignitaries," take it derivatively or euphonically as you will.</p>

<p>3. Is the sentence <i>considerable interest has been evinced at the large majority</i> (p. 235)
English at all? Should it not be either:</p>

<p>"Considerable <i>interest</i> has been evinced <i>in</i> the ..." Or</p>

<p>"Considerable interest has been <i>evinced by</i> the ..."?</p>

<p>But here, like Rosa Dartle, I merely ask for information&mdash;not being a competent
grammarian&mdash;and leave it to fair judgment.</p>

<p>Could you not follow up the article on "Particles" with one on "Split Infinitives"?
We were always taught that they were the unforgivable sin. Yet I have just
found two unblushing examples in one of Mr. Thomas Hardy's novels. If he may

<p>(1) In Stanza 22, "Emperor" is a fine word and perhaps inevitable: but would it
be merely pedantic to remind the poet that when Bonaparte was in Egypt in 1798 he
was not yet Emperor, nor even First Consul?</p>

<p>(2) In Stanza 30, eighth line, does not grammar require the reading "but thee"

the "Boy on the Burning Deck." Burns (I think) has a line somewhere that clearly
shows the true usage:</p>

<h2>BOOKS OF THE MONTH</h2>

<h3>POETRY</h3>

<h4 class="left">POEMS, 1916&ndash;1918. By <span class="smcap">Francis Brett Young</span>. Collins. 5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Brett Young's <i>Marching on Tanga</i> was the best written of all the books produced
during the war by men on active service. Its imaginative quality and the charm of its
style were no surprise to those who knew his early novels, of which <i>The Dark Tower</i>
was the most notable. It has been succeeded by two other prose works, <i>The Crescent
Moon</i>, an African story, the melodrama of which is veiled by the beautiful descriptive
writing, and <i>The Young Physician</i>, a more naturalistic essay which was noticed in our
first number. Unobtrusively, amid these other activities, he published two or three
years ago a little book of verses, <i>Five Degrees South</i>; and in this new volume are gathered
the contents of that book and the poems that their author has written more recently.</p>

<p>The volume is characteristically Georgian. There are hints, here and there, of musings
which may develop into a general conception of the universe and of man; there are
points of contact with the problems which vex the reflective spirit. But, generally
speaking, Mr. Brett Young is content to sing, briefly and with deep feeling, of a few
things securely loved: and those points of contact are points of departure. He writes
of England&mdash;friends, landscapes, and a woman&mdash;before he leaves England. When he is
in Africa the blood and struggle, the fell tropical scenery, seem but to make acuter the
response to the England that is lost; and when he comes home again he sings again of
home recovered and loved with a new intensity. <i>The Gift</i> gives the keynote of the book:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>All his deepest feelings&mdash;patriotism, love, friendship&mdash;are interwoven with natural
beauty. In <i>Testament</i> he leaves to his friend the common memory of a summer in the
Cotswolds: sunlight on the gables of Evesham, a boat on the cool water of Avon, sunsets
over Bredon, evening stocks and the scent of hay; and in the most eloquent close,
putting the most beautiful scenes of earth behind him to sing of spiritual beauty, he
lingers on them to describe them. But his descriptions are always prompted and suffused
by emotion: like Brooke in <i>The Happy Lover</i> and Mr. Masefield in <i>Biography</i>, he catalogues
the scenes, the fields, trees, flowers, and faces that live sweetly in his memory,
and his affection is communicated. He is poles away from the "careful nature poet"
who makes a neat drawing of anything that at all interests him. Emotion selects his
subjects; he does not manufacture. He writes clearly too and unaffectedly. Except in
<i>Thamar</i>&mdash;the most ambitious poem in the book, but promising a greater success than
it achieves&mdash;he is never obscure for a moment. And his simplicity of expression conceals
a good deal of technical effort. The longer pieces&mdash;such as <i>The Leaning Elm</i>&mdash;are
elaborately musical, and an examination of the first poem quoted above will reveal
studied, though not obtrusive, assonances and internal rhymes which show that Mr.
Brett Young (it might be deduced elsewhere from his metres) has not read his Bridges
in vain. There is scarcely a bad poem in the book, or one without an interest peculiar to
itself. Several beyond those we have mentioned&mdash;the best are the exquisite <i>Prothalamion</i>
and <i>Invocation</i>&mdash;are to be found in the recent Georgian book. The poem on prehistoric
remains on the battlefield might well have been added, and <i>Bête Humaine</i>:</p>

<h4 class="left">COLLECTED POEMS OF THOMAS HARDY. Macmillan. 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<h4 class="p0 left">RUDYARD KIPLING'S VERSE: INCLUSIVE EDITION, 1885&ndash;1918. Three
vols. Hodder &amp; Stoughton. 63<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It is always a satisfaction to have in one volume&mdash;or in two or three uniform volumes&mdash;the
verses of a poet which we have previously had to search for in self-contained books.
The publication of a collected edition of Mr. Hardy's poems is welcome for another
reason. In the last few years his reputation as a poet&mdash;quite apart from the fact that he
has continued, right up to his eightieth year, to produce novel and beautiful work&mdash;has
greatly increased. Critics may now be found who even hold that Mr. Hardy's chief
claim to greatness will rest, in the eyes of posterity, upon his poems (including <i>The
Dynasts</i>) rather than upon those novels which in themselves made him one of the two
or three most conspicuous writers of his generation. But even now we do not think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
his stature as a poet is widely realised, the volume and quality of his poetical work
generally known: and there will probably be many who, in perusing this "collected"
volume, will be struck for the first time with the fact that here alone, leaving all the
prose out of the question, is work sufficient, and sufficiently good, to place its author
among the greatest English writers of the last century. There are hundreds of pages of
short poems, some of them exquisitely beautiful, and all of them so direct and fresh
that even the most faulty are worth having. Faults&mdash;though we might rather call them
idiosyncrasies&mdash;Mr. Hardy certainly has. His language is sometimes bald and sometimes
cumbrous; his consistent pessimism sometimes leads him, in the dramatic poems,
to extremes of deliberate gloom. But can we regret a sad philosophy which has enabled
a sweet and sensitive spirit to shine with such uninterrupted brightness amid that gloom?
And can we regret a habit of phraseology which has enabled Mr. Hardy to win some of
his greatest technical triumphs (for he makes music out of scientific or journalistic
words which would ruin an ordinary lyrist) and which will probably have direct results
in the way of enlarging the poetic vocabulary, which is in constant need of oxygenation?
It is inevitable that a collected edition in one volume should be printed in smaller type
than is entirely comfortable, and the text of this edition is not so attractive as that of
the separate volumes. But it is all here, and when the reader compares the volume to
some of its companion Macmillan collections (Clough, for instance, falls into nothingness)
he comprehends that in the history of English literature Mr. Hardy will rank above
many of the supposedly established classics. He is a great poet.</p>

<p>The Kipling collection is luxuriously got up, but unfortunately the covers are not all
they might be, and the reader is irritated throughout by the presence on the top of
every right-hand page of "Inclusive Edition" in large black capitals. Mr. Kipling
would show up far better in a selection than in a complete edition, so much of his verse
is at best vigorous journalism. Were a good selection made we believe that some of
those who depreciate him would admit for the first time that he has a fine poet in him;
a collected edition merely shows that he does not know the poet in him from the rhymer.
The greater one's admiration for his best work the greater the irritation one sustains
when reading through the great body of his jingling journalism and pompous sermonising.
Had he written nothing but the <i>Ballad of East and West</i>, the songs from Puck and
a few more he would be as well remembered as he will be now with all this mass of
versification to his name.</p>

<h4 class="left">WHEELS 1919: A FOURTH CYCLE. Blackwell. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The end-papers of this volume bear a charming design of athletes throwing darts at
targets, and it is to be observed that no one of them as yet has hit the bull's-eye. We do
not know if the symbolism was deliberate, but it is apt, for the volume is full of potshots
so wayward that we are usually uncertain as to which target these erratic slingers
wish to hit. Music at least is not desired: most of the verses consist of strings of statements&mdash;if
they are not disconnected the connections between them are not apparent
to us&mdash;interesting neither severally nor jointly, and entirely without beauty of sound.
Miss Edith Sitwell's verses, though incomprehensible, contain a good deal of vivid
detail, pleasant because it reminds us of bright pictures. There is one poem by the late
Wilfred Owen (<i>Strange Meeting</i>) which has a powerful, sombre beginning:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It seemed that out of the battle I escaped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down some profound dull tunnel, long since scooped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through granites which Titanic wars had groined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet also there encumbered sleepers groaned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too fast in thought or death to be bestirred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as I probed them, one sprang up, and stared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With piteous recognition in fixed eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting distressful hands as if to bless.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by his smile, I knew that sullen hall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a thousand fears that vision's face was grained;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet no blood reached here from the upper ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no guns thumped, or down the flues made moan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Strange, friend," I said. "Here is no cause to mourn."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"None," said the other. "Save the undone years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hopelessness. Whatever hope is yours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was my life also."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">There are several other poems by him which have all the earnestness, and much of the
force, of Mr. Sassoon's illustrations of the beastly cruelty of war. But the one poet
included who is always arousing interest and curiosity is Mr. Aldous Huxley. Mr.
Huxley, when these poems were written (though, in <i>Leda</i>, he seems already to be partly
recovering), seems to have been in the same sort of revulsion against sentimentality as
Rupert Brooke was in when his first book was being composed. He is anxious that we
should not overlook the facts that there are noisome smells in the world, that many
people are disgusting to see, and that even the most touching episode may be interrupted
by an eructation: though, unlike Brooke, he does not usually even try to sing.
There is something very familiar about the restaurant poem:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What negroid holiday makes free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such priapic revelry?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What songs? What gongs? What nameless rites?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What gods like wooden stalagmites?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What reeking steam of kidney pie?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What blasts of Bantu melody?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ragtime ... but when the wearied band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swoons to a waltz, I take her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there we sit in blissful calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quietly sweating palm to palm.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">There is always strength about Mr. Huxley's epithets: he observes accurately and his
language is hard, clear, and original. He conveys his unpleasing ruminations with such
force that in several places we were incommoded by a rising in our gorge. But it is not
in order to obtain sensations of that kind that we read poetry, and we shall not in idle
hours beguile our leisure by repeating over and over the much-loved syllables of <i>The
Betrothal of Priapus</i>. Mr. Huxley can see things with his own eyes, and has a powerful
intelligence, and when he has discovered something to write about he may become a
very good poet.</p>

<h4 class="left">GENERAL WILLIAM BOOTH ENTERS INTO HEAVEN, AND OTHER
POEMS. By <span class="smcap">Nicholas Vachel Lindsay</span>. With an Introduction by <span class="smcap">Robert
Nichols</span>. Chatto &amp; Windus. 5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Vachel Lindsay is best known as the author of poems, notably poems inspired by
negro camp-meetings, which are meant for recitation; they have intoxicating rhythms
and the language full of gusto. <i>The Congo</i>, <i>The Daniel Jazz</i>, and others should certainly
be introduced to the British public, and perhaps Messrs. Chatto propose to follow up
this volume with another containing Mr. Lindsay's later work. It is a pity, however,
that the present collection should have come first, for it contains little that is characteristic
of Mr. Lindsay at his best, and little, therefore, that will show readers here how good
he can be. The title-poem, though not as good as some of its successors, is the only
one now published which shows what Mr. Lindsay can do. It describes the entrance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
of the late General Booth into Paradise at the head of the motley army whom he
has saved:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Booth led boldly with his big bass drum&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saints smiled gravely and they said "He's come&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walking lepers followed, rank on rank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lurching bravoes from the ditches dank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drabs from the alleyways and drug fiends pale&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minds still passion-ridden, soul-powers frail:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vermin-eaten saints with mouldy breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwashed legions with the ways of Death&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?)<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The other poems are far more ordinary in form and banal in language. Mr. Lindsay, at
this stage, was writing like other people, and his verse was redeemed from commonplaceness
only by its sincerity and high spirits. He is an "uplifter" who is as jovial as
Falstaff; he is probably the only poet on record, except Shelley, to be a teetotaller, and
certainly the only one to take an active part in an anti-Saloon campaign. The second best
poem in this book is an elegy, in couplets, on O. Henry; an elegy both romantic and
truthful. Of the others an address to the U.S. Senate is decidedly racy. A senator whom
Mr. Lindsay regarded as undesirable was elected. His verses on the occasion begin:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And must the Senator from Illinois<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be this squat thing, with blinking, half-closed eyes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This brazen gutter idol, reared to power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a leering pyramid of lies?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">That is what met the eyes of the newly-elected when he opened his local paper on the
morning after the poll.</p>

THE WORLD WAR: 1914&ndash;1919. Edited by <span class="smcap">George Herbert Clarke</span>. Hodder
&amp; Stoughton. 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>If this be a treasury it contains not merely gold and silver, but copper, nickel, Britannia
metal, brass, and lead. Even if all the good poems inspired by the war were brought
together they would not make a book of over four hundred closely-printed pages.
Mr. Clarke is Professor of English in the University of Tennessee. His collection,
amongst those who are sufficiently undiscriminating to like it, may promote Anglo-American
friendship; if it does it will have justified its existence. Otherwise its only
value consists in its reproduction of certain poems which are not, we think, to be found
elsewhere. We believe that the Poet Laureate's <i>Wounded</i> (which appeared in the <i>Times</i>)
is one of these. It is a very lusty poem inspired by Trafalgar Square in sunshine:
wounded lads lolling by the lions and Nelson standing above. It ends:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The gentle unjealous Shakespeare, I trow,<br /></span>

<p class="in0">This poem&mdash;it is not the only one&mdash;was overlooked by those who were recently yelping
at Mr. Bridges for having written nothing about the war.</p>

<p class="inp">The question how far the novel can be, or should be, a criticism of society, not of life
in Arnold's sense, but of the forms in which life manifests itself at given times and
places, is one that has been discussed but is never likely to find a general settlement.
There will always be purists, of the "art for art's sake" order, who will maintain that
the discussion or even the exposition, as such, of practical social problems is out of
place in fiction. There will always be those who maintain, as did Mr. H. G. Wells some
years ago, that "if the novel is to be recognised as something more than a relaxation, it
has ... to be kept free from the restrictions imposed upon it by the fierce
pedantries of those who would define a general form for it"&mdash;writers and critics, in
fact, who, like Mr. Wells himself, are prepared to use the novel as a means to any
practical end, whether transient or eternal, of which at the moment it seems capable.
Nor is it particularly desirable that any such settlement should be arrived at; but the
dispute suggests a distinction which has some usefulness. Mr. Wells has picked up, with
the forceps of fiction, and examined by turns politics, religion, education, and the
relations between the sexes. Mr. Bennett, portraying modern society of all kinds no
less closely, has no special suggestion to make to this age or this civilisation: his lesson,
if his books contain one, is of universal applicability. Mr. Conrad, so unlike him in all
else, is with him in this. Mr. Conrad, the novelist, has no views on the treatment of
subject races or the reform of the merchant marine. These two are of the older tradition:
for the novel dealing with social questions is a thing of comparatively recent growth.
Formerly only one artist was allowed, and even expected, to be didactic&mdash;that artist in
whom to-day preaching is most bitterly resented, namely, the poet. He was the bard,
the seer, the prophet, who thundered out of a cloud and instructed the nation. The
dramatist and the novelist were by comparison mere providers of entertainment and
were required at most to give their work a flavour of good morals as a proof of decent
intentions. The drama led the way; and, in the hands of Ibsen and his disciples, it
became an instrument for the examination of topical problems. The novel soon followed
suit, so that we are now confronted with a category of works of fiction in which the
divided aim by no means destroys all artistic interest.</p>

<p>Such a book, in a high degree, is Miss Stern's <i>Children of No Man's Land</i>, which
examines alternately the position of naturalised Germans and their families in England
during the war and the position of those members of the younger generation who have
been left by parental indulgence to drift between the enforced morality, which is spared
them, and the easy immorality, from which their instincts withhold them. In both cases
the meaning of No Man's Land is perfectly clear. It is the barren and abhorred territory
in which wander those who are rejected by both the contending nations; and it is the
land of the <i>demi-vierges</i> or, as Miss Stern somewhat awkwardly calls them, "the demi-maids."
Both problems are clearly presented and examined; but it is not obvious what
purpose is served by thus combining them and giving to them a common symbolism,
or by making a brother suffer in one tract, while his sister strays in the other. They are
not problems in the same category or on the same plane; and their alternate treatment
here hardly conduces to continuity or clarity of thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
But it must be admitted that Miss Stern, having thus handicapped herself, carries
the unnecessary burden with great dexterity. The whole book is written with a hard,
brilliant cleverness that never flags and is conducted through a remarkable variety of
incidents and with the help of a remarkable variety of characters. The study of the
behaviour of the "half-English" during the war has an inherent air of reality and
moderation. But it is not on this that Miss Stern lavishes her fullest powers of description
and reasoning. She is actually more concerned with the development of Deb Marcus,
the beautiful Jewish girl, who is discovered at the opening of the book being kissed by
a middle-aged and unattractive German whom she does not like but whom her fear of
seeming foolish forbids her to repulse. We leave her in comfortable wedlock declaring
that her daughter will be brought up "As strictly as I can, right and wrong, good and
bad ... signposts wherever she may stop and wander. I'm going to superintend
her morals; I'm going to say 'don't,' and I'm going to ask questions, and forbid her
things. And be shocked whenever it's necessary I should be shocked&mdash;&mdash;" "You little
reactionary!" her friend replies; and this, in fact, is the plain moral of Miss Stern's book,
that modern laxity has rendered reaction necessary. But the moral lesson, however just
it may be, would not be acceptable unless it were supported by sound observation or
palatable without good writing. Miss Stern provides both these necessities, and her
pictures of both the half-worlds are extremely convincing and entertaining. She makes
real and keeps distinct a great variety of characters, who, as one thinks over the book,
reappear unmistakably in the mind&mdash;Manon, the marketable <i>ingénue</i>, daughter of an
operatic singer; Antonia Verity, a Diana whose virginity is almost imperceptibly changing
into spinsterhood; Winnie, stupid, sluggish and greedy, in whom inconsistent but rigid
conventions have quite taken the place of morals, "a jumble of puritanism and prejudice
and incurious sensuality," and a host of others. Her men are equally well done, but
perhaps with a care less intense and less from the inside. But it is a sign of Miss Stern's
thoroughness that both men and women should be there in such numbers, so delicately
differentiated, so intricately taking their places in her prolonged and exhaustive argument.
If, of course, she had done no more than provide a gallery of typical portraits to prove a
thesis, her work would hardly be worth discussing at so much length. But she has
managed to avoid the pitfall of the social critic in fiction, and, without ever losing sight
of her main purpose, to compose a book in which no passage is mere argument. The
story proceeds levelly through all its multifarious scenes, continuing to present incident
and character as a novel must do. The skill is perhaps even too great. The reader's
attention is sometimes diverted by it; and it must be said that juggling with cups invites
praise rather of the juggling than of the china. But, in one way and another, Miss Stern
keeps interest vividly alive through a long book, the theme of which is by no means
wholly pleasant. Her wit and vivacity are really remarkable; and the conversations of
her persons are unusually animated. She is without great depth of feeling or perception.
The types with which she deals are shallow; and it is noticeable that the less shallow
they are the more she tends to deal with them from the outside. But <i>Children of No
Man's Land</i> is nevertheless an admirable performance in a difficult kind.</p>

<p><i>Sir Limpidus</i>, by Mr. Marmaduke Pickthall, is another essay in social criticism, for
which the author has somewhat disappointingly deserted the Levant. His hero is a
member of the ruling classes, the son of a wealthy baronet, who is trained from early
youth to follow the code of his peers, in evil-doing and well-doing alike. This leads him,
by way of public-school and university, one entanglement and another, including a
breach of promise case and a suitable marriage, to a seat in the Cabinet and the reverence
of his fellow-countrymen. On the last page:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Suddenly he was recalled to London. There was war in Europe and England might at
any moment be involved in it. How would the people take it? was the question of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
hour. Sir Limpidus was of the opinion that war just then would be a godsend. It would
rouse the ancient spirit of the people and dispel their madness. They would once
more rally to their natural leaders, who, for their part, would throw off the mantle of
frivolity. Even defeat as a united nation would be better than ignoble peace with the
anarchic mob supreme.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">But Mr. Pickthall's final verdict on Sir Limpidus occurs earlier than this, and is put
into the statesman's own mouth or rather mind. Sir Limpidus has delivered an address
at his old school, and is told by his disappointed son that "the fellows ... wanted
you to talk about yourself, the things you've done, in Parliament and foreign countries,
and all that."</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I've not done anything to make a speech about," said Sir Limpidus, after a moment's
hesitation.</p>

<p>His triumph as a statesman was not one of doing. It was the natural consequence of being
what he was. If it came to doing, he had fought a duel in his youth, and in Albania had
assisted to burn down a village. Those incidents in his career were not fit subjects for a
speech to schoolboys; and besides them in the way of doing there was nothing but
pursuit of women and field sports. So it was with a smile over the double meaning of the
words that he repeated: "I've done nothing to make a speech about."</p>

<p>The headmaster, following his distinguished guest, happened to overhear this mild
disclaimer, and he laughed aloud, calling his colleagues round him to enjoy the
classic joke.</p></blockquote>

<p>These two extracts will serve better than any analysis to explain both the direction
and the method of Mr. Pickthall's satire. It has the doubtful merit (in a satire) of being
consistently moderate; and Sir Limpidus, who is never quite a figure of truth, also
misses ever being quite a figure of fun. Social criticism on these lines may put forward
quite adequately the author's point of view; but unless it has some imaginative vigour
it cannot be said to justify the form in which it is cast. Mr. Pickthall's book is a presentation,
by means of characters instead of by abstract arguments, of certain lines of thought
regarding politics, education, and other questions; and in so far it is an essay in the
same <i>genre</i> as Miss Stern's novel. Where it differs is in the fact that the lines of thought
have remained to the author incomparably more interesting than the means of their
presentation. These figures are painted in the flat: they have little imaginative life: and,
as a work of creative fiction, the book must be regarded as a failure.</p>

<p>With the remainder of the books on our list, we return to the older tradition of the
novel, the tradition which seeks to produce a work of art, the lessons deducible from
which (if any) are, roughly, applicable to human nature in general. In this sort, Mrs.
Virginia Woolf has written a very extraordinary story. Katharine Hilbery, after much
hesitation, engages herself to William Rodney, a precise Civil Servant, who writes plays
in verse. He develops doubts of their love simultaneously with hers, and is not sure
whether he is not in love with her cousin, Cassandra, as, after some curious experiments
in emotionalism, he discovers himself to be. He therefore disengages himself from
Katharine and engages himself to Cassandra. Meanwhile Ralph Denham, a brilliant
and more vital, if less polished, young man, in love with Katharine, seeing her
given to William, proposes to Mary Datchet, who loves him but refuses him. When
Katharine is free he proposes to her and is accepted. This story Mrs. Woolf tells in
nearly five hundred-and-fifty pages of fairly close print.</p>

<p>The taste for her writing is decidedly an acquired one; and, as we have proved by
experiment, it is possible to read some two hundred pages without acquiring it. But
when a certain saturation point is reached, a remarkable change takes place in the
reader's sensibility; and what before he thought amazingly tedious and thin-spun he

beginning and reading again the two hundred pages which wearied him at the first
attempt. Mrs. Woolf has indeed proved a truth which undoubtedly exists but which
few writers are capable of establishing, namely, that no character, properly ascertained
and portrayed, can ever be uninteresting. It is not by vivacity or humour that she
maintains the readableness of her innumerable scenes and conversations. Perhaps the
most vivacious passage in the book is the description of Cassandra, as she appears in
William's memory:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Cassandra Otway had a very fine taste in music, and he had charming recollections of her
in a light fantastic attitude, playing the flute in the morning-room at Stogdon House. He
recalled with pleasure the amusing way in which her nose, long like all the Otway noses,
seemed to extend itself into the flute, as if she were some inimitably graceful species of
musical mole. The little picture suggested very happily her melodious and whimsical
temperament.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Mrs. Woolf is not a satirist, not even so much as was Jane Austen; and she avoids
humour for its own sake, not so much because she is not capable of it as because that
is not here her concern. The outstanding quality of her book is its consistent wealth of
minute and accurate observation, both of behaviour and of states of mind, by means of
which the persons are at length fully revealed. Extracts from work of this sort are unfortunately,
as a rule, not very convincing: it is like a liquid which has no colour when it is
seen in a tea-spoon and a great deal when it is seen in a bucket. But a specimen may be
given. Here Katharine and Rodney, sitting together in silence, are considering for the
first time the possibility of breaking their engagement:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>She would have spoken, but could not bring herself to ask him for signs of affection
which she had no right to claim. The conviction that he was thus strange to her filled her
with despondency, and illustrated quite beyond doubt the infinite loneliness of human
beings. She had never felt the truth of this so strongly before. She looked away into the
fire; it seemed to her that even physically they were now scarcely within speaking distance,
and spiritually there was certainly no human being with whom she could claim comradeship;
no dream that satisfied her as she was used to be satisfied; nothing remained in whose
reality she could believe, save those abstract ideas&mdash;figures, laws, stars, facts, which she
could hardly hold to for lack of knowledge and a kind of shame.</p>

<p>When Rodney owned to himself the folly of this prolonged silence and the meanness of
such devices, and looked up ready to seek some excuse for a good laugh or opening for a
confession, he was disconcerted by what he saw. Katharine seemed equally oblivious
of what was bad or of what was good in him. Her expression suggested concentration upon
something entirely remote from her surroundings. The carelessness of her attitude seemed
to him rather masculine than feminine. His impulse to break up the constraint was chilled,
and once more the exasperating sense of his own impotency returned to him. He could not
help contrasting Katharine with his vision of the engaging, whimsical Cassandra;
Katharine undemonstrative, inconsiderate, silent, and yet so notable that he could never
do without her good opinion.</p>

<p>She veered round upon him a moment later, as if, when her train of thought was ended,
she became aware of his presence.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This is woven of gossamer threads, and so indeed is the whole novel; but these threads
make together a consistent, flexible, and beautiful fabric. There is one further observation
that is perhaps worth making. Writers who go so deeply into the minutenesses of
psychology and behaviour as Mrs. Woolf commonly tend to obscurity not only in their
material but also in their presentation of it. In the pages of this book there is not one
thought or one sentence that is not impeccably lucid.</p>

<p><i>The Power of a Lie</i>, by Mr. Jonas Bojer, a Norwegian author, whose book, <i>The Great
Hunger</i>, has already attracted attention, is preceded by an introduction by Sir Hall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
Caine; and indeed the farmers and peasants with which it deals do a little recall the
Manxmen of that writer's early work. But there the suitability of this sponsorship ends;
and we must enter a protest against the practice of handicapping a book with a preface
by a critic who is evidently incapable of understanding it or of expressing himself
intelligently upon it. The story is sufficiently simple. Knut Norby, a wealthy, simple,
good-hearted, irascible old farmer, has allowed himself in a weak moment to be cajoled
into backing a bill for Wangen, who is an unbalanced, incompetent, and rather unamiable
person. Wangen fails; and Norby is reduced to panic terror by the thought of what his
wife will say when she hears of his folly. He therefore puts off the moment of confession
by speaking so evasively as to give the impression that he denies having signed the bond,
and Fru Norby, indignant against the man who has sought to defraud her husband,
takes the matter into her own hands and lays a charge of forgery against Wangen. The
innocent man, who is guilty enough in other particulars, having brought many persons
who trusted him to destitution, is elevated into a condition of excessive self-righteousness
by this unjust accusation. Norby struggles for some time to put matters right, but
his courage always fails him at the point of confession; and gradually he comes to
regard Wangen as a wicked man and as the tool of unscrupulous persons. Wangen,
always weak and shifty, at length forges a letter to prove his case, which he cannot do
otherwise, as the only witness to the signature is dead. His forgery is detected, and he
is sentenced to a year's hard labour. Meanwhile Norby has argued himself out of the
truth and back into the condition of benevolent justice, which is his natural state. The
book ends with a banquet given to him by his neighbours to show their sympathy
with him in his trials.</p>

<p>On this very remarkable composition Sir Hall Caine has the following observations
to make:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This book says, if I do not misunderstand it, that the sense of innocence in an innocent
man may be corrupting and debasing; that to prove himself guiltless a man may make
himself guilty, and that nearly every good and true impulse of the heart may be whittled
away by the suspicion and abuse of the world.</p>

<p>I confess, though I am here to introduce this book to English readers, and do so with
gladness and pride, that this is teaching of which I utterly disapprove. It conflicts with all
my experience of life to think that a man may commit forgery, as Wangen does, to prove
himself innocent of forgery, and that a man may become unselfish, as Norby becomes
unselfish, by practising the most selfish duplicity. If I had to believe this I should also have
to believe that there is no knowledge of right and wrong in the heart of man, no sense of
sin, that conscience is only a juggling fiend, and that the presiding power in the world not
only is not God, but is the devil.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This passage is worth quoting because it suggests what Mr. Bojer has avoided. Sir Hall
Caine demands, to all intents and purposes, a book like one of his own, in which there
are definite and distinguishable categories of good men and bad men, in which virtue
is ranged uncompromisingly against vice. But Sir Hall Caine's books, as this preface
would suggest, even if we had never seen one of them, are, since the very earliest of
them, negligible both artistically and morally. Mr. Bojer has attempted something
different and has succeeded in writing a most unusual and interesting novel. He makes
the perennial discovery that good and bad are mixed in all men and he adds the discovery
that the sufferings of bad men are not always the results of, or proportionate to,
their sins. He has done these things in a story which astonishes the reader by its straightforwardness
and simplicity. The characters are presented by means of the barest lines;
and no incident or theme is elaborated beyond a few pages. Nevertheless the central idea
is adequately worked out, and the whole novel leaves a distinct and vivid impression
on the mind.</p>

In Mr. Joseph Hergesheimer discriminating English readers found over a year ago
an American novelist whom, alone of his generation, they were able to admire and to
consider seriously. This may have been partly because he has learnt something, but not
so much as to seem ridiculous, from English models, and because he writes with a
restraint, moderation, and detachment which are rare in his literary compatriots. But
there was certainly also a definite and individual virtue in him to which critical opinion
in this country responded. He had a lively and exact visual gift and a power of rendering
great passion without risk of bombast; and these qualities were rightly held to redeem
many faults and weaknesses in <i>The Three Black Pennys</i>. In <i>Java Head</i>, published in the
middle of last year, the first of these qualities was still perceptible, but, as regarded the
second, Mr. Hergesheimer's avoidance of rant appeared to have become a paralysing
inhibition. We do not know quite what to make of his third book, <i>Gold and Iron</i>. In the
absence of any information to the contrary it would be natural to suppose that it is a
later work than the other two; but this seems to us almost impossible and, if indeed it
be so, decidedly regrettable. It consists of three <i>nouvelles</i> or "long-short stories," of
which the first, <i>Wild Oranges</i>, describing the rescue of a girl from a household living
in isolation and terrorised by a homicidal man-servant, is, except for a few passages of
description, a negligible piece of the magazine order. In the second and third we do
discover traces of the Mr. Hergesheimer whose talents excited us in 1918. One deals
with the resuscitation, by a cold, contained, and determined man, of a deserted blast-furnace
and his attempt to establish himself as a magnate. The other describes the
return of a gold-miner, rich but with hands reddened in one of the incidents of Forty-Nine,
from California to his prim and sleepy native village on the coast of Massachusetts.
In both of these Mr. Hergesheimer's object is to discover to the reader the interior
passions of intense but reserved and hardly articulate personalities. This is an ambition
worthy of a novelist of the first rank; and indeed, both in setting himself such a task and
in his methods of approaching it, Mr. Hergesheimer reveals himself as a writer of more
than common powers. But it can hardly be said to be successfully accomplished here.
In glimpses both Alexander Hulings and Jason Burrage are grasped and shown as living
men. Hulings comes vigorously and convincingly to life in his duel with Partridge
Sinnox, the dangerous gentleman from New Orleans; it is possible to see Burrage,
smoking a cheroot, feet up on the brass rail of the hearth, with the refined and yet original
Honora Canderay beside him, at his first visit to her. But between such glimpses as
these both figures disappear, as though in a moving mist, behind Mr. Hergesheimer's
attempt to describe them. He will describe them only in the precise and rigid way which
he has chosen, a way which involves omissions, reticences, and silences, subtle appeals
to the reader's understanding; and, in these stories at least, he has by no means mastered
it. It was used with much more success in <i>The Three Black Pennys</i> and in <i>Java Head</i>,
and is probably capable of much further development. If we are right in our surmise
that these stories are early work, there is a possibility that Mr. Hergesheimer may yet
show himself to be a very remarkable novelist indeed.</p>

<h3>BELLES-LETTRES AND CRITICISM</h3>

<h4 class="left">THE LETTERS OF CHARLES SORLEY. Cambridge University Press. 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
net.</h4>

<p>The value set on irony by the Greeks might well be studied by us moderns. A proper
sense of irony teaches both humility and patience, and it will not lead to cynicism unless
the basis of the soul be cynical. It teaches, above all, proportion, which is the lesson
needed most, perhaps, by modern artists and sociologists, philanthropists and
theologians, business men and politicians. These letters of Charles Sorley's, the letters
of a young, eager, cultivated boy, are rendered ironical by circumstance. After the
ordinary life of a public schoolboy at Marlborough he went, in 1914, before going to
Oxford, for an educational holiday in Germany. He stayed in a German family, he was
enthusiastic about German things and German people as compared with the English,
and he reached England only just in time to escape being a prisoner of war in Germany.
The letters are lively, intelligent rather than terse, good-humoured, shrewd and full
of that enthusiasm which was Charles Sorley's great natural talent. It is not, however,
the essays on Masefield and Housman which give the book its interest. It is the pages
on his life in Germany and a few passages on life in the Army which make the volume
one of the most remarkable records of the young England which bore the brunt of
the war.</p>

<p>How delightful is this passage on the German supper&mdash;Sorley lodged in an academic
household at Schwerin:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The people come at seven, and talk about the rise in the price of butter till 8. From 8
till 9.30 they eat and drink and talk about the niceness of the victuals, and ask the hostess
their cost. From 9.30 to 10.30 they talk about the scarcity of eggs. From 10.30 to 11 they
drink beer and cross-examine me about the Anglo-German crisis. From 11 till 12 they
make personal remarks and play practical jokes on one another. From 12 to 12.30 they
eat oranges and chocolate and declare they must be going now. From 12.30 to 1 they get
heavy again and sigh over the increased cost of living in Schwerin. At 1 they begin to scatter.
By 2 I am in bed.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">That is not the only passage which takes the reader straight into the atmosphere of the
Caravaners. There is this anecdote, too:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A friend of sorts of the Bilders died lately; and, when the Frau attempted to break the
news to Karl at table, he immediately said, "Don't tell me anything sad while I'm eating."</p></blockquote>

<p>Charles Sorley remarks on this that an exact parallel may be found in the Odyssey
where the gentleman expostulates οὐ γαρ ἐγώ γε τερπομ' ὀδυρόμενος μεταδόρπιος {ou gar egô ge terpom' oduromenos metadorpios}&mdash;I hate being
forced to grieve in the middle of supper.</p>

<p>The letters are full of casual literary criticism, and provide a curious contrast to
the letters of Lionel Johnson recently published. Charles Sorley strikes one as having
a far clearer idea of the position of literature in life than had Johnson, but he shows
little sign of that fine critical intelligence which mark Johnson's best judgments.
Sorley passes passionately from Masefield to Housman, from Housman to Hardy,
from Hardy to Ibsen and Goethe. It seems odd that a boy of his temperament should
think <i>Faust</i> greater than anything of Shakespeare's, and by implication greater than
<i>Peer Gynt</i>; elsewhere he passes a really witty judgment on Goethe: "If Goethe really
died saying 'More light,' it was very silly of him: what <i>he</i> wanted was more warmth."</p>

<p>His life in the Army was not long. After a hard training in England he left for France
in May, 1915, and was killed by a sniper on October 13th. The books he had over
there were <i>Faust</i> and Richard Jefferies. To some of us Jefferies is chiefly lovable and
remarkable because of the men who have loved him; and that he could charm Sorley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>
and bring to him, amid the disgust of the battlefield, something of the English countryside,
gives him an additional claim on our gratitude:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I read Richard Jefferies to remind me of Liddington Castle and the light green and dark
green of the Aldbourne Downs in summer.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">The book is edited by Professor and Mrs. Sorley, and Mrs. Sorley contributes a brief
biographical chapter. There are one or two references to living persons which would,
perhaps, be better away, though we cannot imagine any person of humour objecting to
the fun of this high-spirited, generous boy. Incidentally, in its picture of Marlborough
and Sorley's literary activities, the letters provide a useful counterpoise to the rather
reckless attacks made on the uncultured public schools of England.</p>

<h4 class="left">ESSAYS ON ART. By A. <span class="smcap">Clutton-Brock</span>. Methuen. 5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Shall we ever have a satisfactory æsthetic? Sometimes, in moments of hopefulness, one
believes that there may be a few points of agreement in ethics, in politics, in metaphysics,
even in economics: but to read a new book on æsthetic is to wonder again whether we
shall ever get beyond the old tag, that it's a mere waste of time arguing about taste.
Certainly Mr. Clutton-Brock's book, interesting, acute, and charmingly written as it is,
does not show us how to reconcile, let us say, Tolstoy's <i>What is Art?</i> with Whistler's
<i>Ten o'Clock</i>: or either with the great and unjustly-despised body of criticism to be found
in Ruskin's works. His essays are provocative: at times he appears to clear up certain
matters, and then the reader finds himself wondering.</p>

<p>In the very first essay Mr. Clutton-Brock discourses on nature and art. "There is
one beauty of nature and another of art." "Nothing kills art so certainly as the effort
to produce a beauty of the same kind as that which is perceived in nature. In the
beauty of nature, as we perceive it, there is a perfection of workmanship which
is perfection because there is no workmanship. Natural things are not made, but
born; works of art are made. There is the essential difference between them and between
their beauties." Now is there any truth in those statements? Take, for instance, the
simplest kind of beauty, the beauty which appeals to touch: is there any essential
difference between the sensations of beauty given by stroking a sable and stroking a
piece of exquisite silk velvet? Again, is the beauty conveyed by the sight of Cader
Idris really different in kind from the beauty conveyed by the sight of Amiens Cathedral?
Is a singer's appeal fundamentally different from the appeal of the nightingale?</p>

<p>Mr. Clutton-Brock goes on to say that "all great works of art show an effort, a roughness,
an inadequacy of craftsmanship which is the essence of their beauty, and distinguishes
it from the beauty of nature." That sentence betrays what seems to us his
saddest error. He is confusing, we think, art and craft. It simply is not true that a work
of art must show "inadequacy of craftsmanship." What is essential is that the artist
should not seem to be satisfied with his mere technical skill of craft. He should, somehow,
convey to us that he knows there is a beauty which no craft can render perfectly. He
must, in short, be humble. For lack of that humility Blake refused to call Rubens a
great artist. Yet Rubens, superb craftsman as he was, was not the superior of Velasquez,
who yet preserves in all his work that sense of something desired yet unachieved&mdash;unachieved
not because Velasquez's craft was inadequate, but because his vision was
interpretative rather than imitative. It is important that the distinction between craft
and art should be recognised, otherwise Mr. Clutton-Brock's perfectly sound contention
that the beauty of art "is produced by the effort to accomplish the impossible" will be
made a mere excuse for slovenly workmanship. This sort of discussion, however, is
unsuitable for a review; even where space is, for practical purposes, infinite (<i>e.g.</i> in a
conversation), it seldom leads to agreement. We can only say (what everybody knows)
that Mr. Clutton-Brock is the sanest of all professional art-critics and that to differ
from him is to doubt one's own opinions.</p>

<h4 class="left">UNHAPPY FAR-OFF THINGS. By <span class="smcap">Lord Dunsany</span>. Elkin Matthews.
5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Lord Dunsany's fancy can generally be trusted to discover many odd prettinesses for
our pleasure, but as in old Battersea enamel the prettiness is liable to chip off and show
the dull metal beneath; and in these twelve sketches there is little of fancy. They were
written "to show," so the Preface tells us, "something of the extent of the wrongs that
the people of France had suffered," and the cultivated lack of vigour in style does serve,
somehow, to illustrate the desolation of towns laid waste, and&mdash;which more peculiarly
touches Lord Dunsany's sympathy&mdash;gardens. The monotony of the scene is, too, well
typified by the same quality in description. Frequently, as in <i>The Real Thing</i>, when he
sets out to be fantastic he is merely trivial; and throughout he draws from a wealth of
ingenious but ungainly metaphor. However, the author well understands that the
utmost terror of desolation can be inspired by the sound (rather than the sight) of man-made
things gone to rust. Out in the dead land, where villages are to be conjectured
from scattered heaps of stones, he was much impressed&mdash;for he refers to it again and
again&mdash;by the "mournful sound of iron flapping on broken things," and&mdash;"this was
the sound that would haunt the waste for ever." On the other hand, in <i>Bermondsey
versus Wurtemburg</i>, he observed that a German soldier had chalked up the name of his
regiment on a wall&mdash;the 156th Wurtemburgers. Subsequently a British soldier had
prefaced this with "Lost by," and added after "retaken by the Bermondsey Butterflies."
This might have served to point the less serious moments of a special correspondent
to one of the lighter newspapers, but it scarcely warrants preservation in an
admirably printed book with a strong binding in excellent taste.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE ROMANTIC ROUSSILLON. By <span class="smcap">Isabel Savory</span>. T. Fisher Unwin. 25<i>s.</i>
net.</h4>

<p>"The thought of 'the picturesque' repels me," writes Miss Savory in extenuation of
her offence in the kind of sightseeing which less sophisticated tourists, for whom she
accuses Nature of "touting," joyfully regard as inevitable. But though from time to
time she is careful lest the reader should associate her with the organisations of Cook and
Lunn, this superiority to the obvious is not always implicit. Whether the ideal book of
travels should satisfy us by our own firesides or should merely stimulate us to go and
see things for ourselves is a question that Miss Savory has not helped to decide. Her
vision is uneven, but on the whole she provokes and does not satisfy curiosity. The book
is a record of an exhaustive (and one would say exhausting) exploration of the Eastern
Pyrenees, with Perpignan, Ille-sur-Tet, Estagel, and other places as centres for radiating
expeditions, and "we did many wanders at Salses," she says. She climbed high mountains,
and admired the views; she visited forgotten villages, and raked up their history;
she lingered&mdash;none too long&mdash;under groined roofs and in panelled <i>salles</i>. But in her
frank delight in good wine and food there is real vitality and emphatic, if unconscious,
art. "We picked bunch after bunch (of grapes) hot in the sun, buried our faces in the
warmness of them ... bit not one but mouthfuls, sweet and juicy...."
And then she goes on to tell us that at the same moment there would be a "little sad,
sour, tight bunch not a quarter grown" on a house in Gower Street, and that nobody
was ever quite so dead as Queen Anne.</p>

<p>However, Miss Savory need not fear lest we should fail to recognise her appreciation
of the beautiful things she saw, more especially as many of them&mdash;carvings,
chateaux, plaster-work&mdash;are admirably reproduced as illustrations in collotype from the
drawings of Miss M. L. MacKenzie: but our recognition would have been quicker if
she had been at less pains to impress us with her originality.</p>

<h4 class="left">JACOPONE DA TODI. By <span class="smcap">Evelyn Underhill</span>. Dent. 16<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>In the preface to her life and letters of this remarkable man, Miss Underhill says:
"Three types of mind should find pleasure in Jacopone's work and personality.
First, those interested in Christian mysticism.... Next, lovers of poetry....
Last, those who care for the Italy of St. Francis and his descendants." The
last two aspects of an arresting personality will doubtless make the wider appeal,
admirably as his biographer has traced and explained the spiritual development of the
man she calls the first great Italian religious poet.</p>

<p>So sympathetically has Miss Underhill treated the religious experiences of
Jacopone that in the light of her exposition, extravagance, futility, seeming madness
even, seem to take their rightful place in the spiritual history of a man who expresses
that history in strangely beautiful poems. Born probably about 1230, soon after the
death of St. Francis, Jacopone da Todi followed very closely in the steps of his more
famous master. Like St. Francis, he belonged to a noble Umbrian family; like St.
Francis, he turned from a gay worldly existence to the worship of Lady Poverty.
His conversion, however, compared with that of the founder of the Franciscan rule,
was a late one. St. Francis was only twenty-four, Jacopone was nearly forty when he
left the world and its ways to begin the quest for perfection.</p>

<p>A legend (not perhaps entirely legendary, since it is in some respects supported by
the self-revelations of his <i>laude</i>) grew up about his name, and was embodied, years
later, in the so-called <i>Vita</i>, a manuscript of the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>Here it is related that Ser Jacomo&mdash;to give him his worldly title&mdash;was passionately
devoted to his young wife, who was ascetic at heart, yet to please her husband wore the
rich clothes he gave her, and took part in all the gaieties of the town. A tragic ending
to Ser Jacomo's happiness was brought about when, on the occasion of a marriage
festival, his beautiful Vanna was killed by the fall of a balcony.</p>

<p>"And when" (says the <i>Vita</i>) "they took off those garments of vanity which she had
upon her in order to make her ready for the grave they found at last, next to her bare
flesh, a harsh shirt of hair."</p>

<p>The legend goes on to relate that the shock of his wife's death, together with the
discovery of her pious fraud, led first to madness and then to the conversion of Jacopone.
Nowhere in his subsequent poems is there to be found a reference to his marriage.
But this in itself is no proof of the falsity of the story, for, as with most
mediæval penitents, the casting off of his old life meant to him the abjuration of earthly
ties and memories. Jacopone the saint remains nevertheless Ser Jacomo the passionate
lover. No songs in praise of an adored wife or mistress could be more fervid, more
palpitating with emotion than those addressed to his Saviour.</p>

<p>It is by means of these religious poems&mdash;<i>laude</i>, as they were called&mdash;that the successive
stages in the progress of the mystic may be traced. But leaving the mystic aside, we may
feel grateful to Miss Underhill for having placed the poet before us. Many of his
<i>laude</i>, in the English translation of Mrs. Theodore Beck, are given at length in this
book, and very beautiful they are. To forget their theme and to consider only their
form and imagery is to be reminded of secular Italy of the thirteenth century&mdash;its
troubadours, its Court poets, its Courts of Love. For nearly forty years after all Jacopone
had lived in the world, enjoying its laughter, its gaiety, its sunshine, and the poems of
the saint, indicate that he had not forgotten all he learnt as a sinner&mdash;that is as an
ordinary man of the class to which he originally belonged. "<i>O Queen of all Courtesy</i>,"
he begins in an address to the Blessed Virgin&mdash;and we are immediately transported in
thought to a fair garden and a lover with his lute.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE RIDDLE OF THE RUTHVENS AND OTHER STUDIES. By <span class="smcap">William
Roughead</span>. With thirteen Illustrations. William Green &amp; Son Ltd., Edinburgh.
25<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Whether we may consider the reading of criminal annals a profitable occupation or
otherwise, it is an unquestionable fact that they often possess a human interest, for the
imaginative person at all events, far in excess of the records of the intrigues and policies
of kings, statesmen, generals, and priests. And there is a well-nigh unique and special
interest attaching to Scottish <i>causes célèbres</i> which places them in importance far above
the general run of the great trials of all the other nations of Europe. This is
accounted for by the strangely complex psychology of the average and typical Scotsman.
He is a being in whom the emotions are strictly subordinated to the government
of his reason. He is deeply metaphysical, and there is a powerful forensic strain in his
composition. It is seldom indeed that a Scotsman pleads guilty to any charge,
even when he has been caught red-handed. To do so would simply spoil for him
all the pleasure of the trial, and there is probably no one in court who follows the
evidence and pleadings more carefully or with greater zest than the prisoner himself.
Were it possible for him to be closeted with the jury, it is quite conceivable that he
should be found arguing the pros and cons of the case as forcibly and with as great
detachment as any "good man and true" among them. But there is a fatal flaw in the
character of the Scot which detracts to a large extent from the interest that one feels
in his other traits, namely, the theological tendency which in persons of evil life
at last degenerates into pure cant. The condemned prisoner on the scaffold exhorting
the multitude "to avoid the heinous crime of disobedience to parents, inattention to
Holy Scriptures, of being idle and disorderly, and especially of Sabbath-breaking," is
by no means an edifying spectacle. The existence and prevalence of this trait is all the
more curious when one considers that the Scot generally is not lacking in a keen sense
of humour.</p>

<p>The special value of this collection of historic criminal trials and other juridical
studies by Mr. Roughead, however, lies in the fresh light he has been able to throw
upon the respective characters of King James the Sixth of Scotland (First of England),
the most despicable poltroon that ever disgraced a British throne; and of Lord Braxfield,
the prototype of Robert Louis Stevenson's <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>. An old Edinburgh
University Professor of Constitutional Law and History used to say that Charles II.
was the most iniquitous ruler that England ever had, but James II. was still worse. It
was badly expressed, but there was something in it. Its special application was Constitutional,
however, although it might easily be extended to apply universally if we
allow the addition of the proviso that James I. was the worst of all. He was a liar, a
coward, and a hypocrite, full of pedantry and cant. This is conclusively demonstrated
in <i>The Riddle Of the Ruthvens</i>, and in other sketches that deal with the witchcraft
prosecutions that were conducted with such a degree of vindictiveness and fury throughout
the whole of his reign. But perhaps the greatest service of all that Mr. Roughead
has done in the cause of truth and justice is his vindication of the respective characters
of the much-maligned Lord Braxfield and Robert Fergusson the poet from so many of
the absurd eccentricities which have been attributed to them by incompetent biographers
and unscrupulous scandalmongers, and have in course of time, by constant repetition,
become traditional. It is a far cry from the Gowrie Conspiracy to "Antique"
Smith, the forger of the autograph letters of great literary and historical personages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
who is still well remembered in Edinburgh, but these are Mr. Roughead's limits, and
between them there is such a mass of history and criminal psychology as the student
of either will delight in, while the curious, or merely general, reader will find it very
good entertainment.</p>

<h4 class="left">GEORGE BUBB DODINGTON: PATRON AND PLACE-HUNTER. By
<span class="smcap">Lloyd Sanders</span>. John Lane. 1919. 16<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Here is a case of book-making of a somewhat explicit kind, since there is little to say,
and nothing to print, of Dodington which he has not said of himself. There is, of course,
no more harm in making books than there is in making bricks; but if the one wants
straw, as Moses says it did, the other wants humanity. God made Bubb Dodington,
and therefore let him pass for a man. In his own day he passed for a coxcomb; in ours,
which is more censorious, he would certainly have passed for a rascal. In either aspect,
if he is to be treated at all, he requires a more philosophical study than Mr. Sanders
has been able to supply.</p>

<p>Of mean origin, some ability and unbounded impudence, Dodington inherited both
money and land. With the land there accrued to him Parliamentary interest&mdash;to wit, in
some four seats in Dorset and Somerset, which he spent the rest of his life in hawking
from faction to faction with a flagrancy and success which even his own age found
shocking. From first to last&mdash;and he lived a long time&mdash;there were no illusions about
him. Pope scoffed at him until he found metal more attractive, and changed "Bubo"
for "Bufo"; Walpole remarked to Lord Hervey upon "the second time that worthy
has proposed to rise by treading on my neck"; Hervey himself, who seldom had a good
word for anybody, never had a worse than for him. Hanbury Williams, who was never
malevolent, wrote of him that he was</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To no one party, no one man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor to his own self tight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what he voted for at noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rail'd against at night.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Horace Walpole called him a political journalist, meaning by that that he was daily in
the market-place, and for the highest-bidder. Lord Chesterfield thought that "God
made Dodington the coxcomb he is; mere human means could not have brought it
about. He is a coxcomb superior to his parts, though his parts are superior to almost
anybody's." These are Bubb Dodington's best credentials except those which he
supplied for himself. With those, with colossal impudence and four boroughs, he set
up in trade, and did pretty well. He miscalculated the odds more than once: first on the
accession of George II., when he dropped Sir Robert for Spencer Compton; next when
Frederick Prince of Wales enticed him over to Carlton House for the second time, and
promptly died. Slips like those kept him out in the cold until near the end of the
reign. Just in the nick of time he made friends with Lord Bute, and on the accession
of George III., a year before his own death, was made a peer. There is evidence that
he died a contented and complacent man.</p>

<p>Mr. Sanders proposes to "explain" Dodington, but fails for lack of matter. There
is really nothing to explain. There would have been a good deal to expose had not the
creature done it for himself in his egregious <i>Diary</i>. That to be sure is an unexampled
document. Men, before it and since, have written themselves down rogues and peasant
slaves of various kinds, some for amusement, some for edification. But few&mdash;I think no
others&mdash;have written themselves down in the act and intention of writing themselves
up. Casanova occurs to the mind; but Casanova neither wrote himself up nor down,
whereas Dodington's complacency in the act to be a scoundrel is his most remarkable
feature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I desired Lady Aylesbury to carry you Lord Melcombe's <i>Diary</i>. It is curious
indeed; not so much from the secrets that it blabs, which are rather characteristic than
novel, but from the wonderful folly of the author, who was so fond of talking of himself
that he tells all he knew of himself, though scarce an event that does not betray his
profligacy; and (which is still more surprising that he should disclose) almost every one
exposes the contempt in which he was held, and his consequential disappointments
and disgraces!"</p></blockquote>

<p>That is Horace Walpole, writing to Conway in 1784, when the <i>Diary</i> was out. Lord
Hervey, long before it was written, gave him a pungent paragraph. "Mr. Dodington,"
he says, "whilst some people have the <i>je ne sais quoi</i> in pleasing, possessed the <i>je ne sais
quoi</i> in displeasing in the strongest and most universal degree that ever any man was
blessed with that gift.... His vanity in company was so overbearing, so insolent,
and so insupportable that he seemed to exact that applause as his due which other
people solicit, and to think that he had a right to make every auditor his admirer." And
so indeed it is, in this <i>Diary</i> of his dealings between the Prince of Wales and the Administration,
that he solemnly records all his disgustful traffickings of himself and his
boroughs, as if they were negotiations between high contracting powers, and in every
page declares himself both knave and fool in a way which would afford pleasant reading
if it were not so long and so dull. It is enlivened by one delicious, but entirely
unconscious, gleam. In April, 1754, he went down to Bridgewater to an election, having
done his best to sell the seat to the Duke of Newcastle. He spent £2500 on it, and he
lost it. The fourteenth and two following days, he records, "were spent in infamous
and disagreeable compliance with the low habits of venal wretches." Those wretches
naturally were burgesses whom it was necessary that he should buy in order that he
might afterwards sell himself. It is the only good thing in the book, but it is good enough.
The next best thing is the naïve excuse of its editor of 1784 for publishing it, that
by its means politicians might be advised how not to conduct their and the country's
affairs!</p>

<p>Mr. Sanders has done his part of the business with industry and candour. He says
the best he can for his subject, and has left nothing of importance out, either for or
against him, except the account of the trouncing which he received in the House of
Commons for his speech against Sir Robert in 1742. It is told by Horace Walpole, with
gusto, as is only natural, but with obvious accuracy. Mr. Sanders should not have let
him off the chastisement of an insolence and hypocrisy paralleled only by Disraeli's
attack upon another Sir Robert. On the credit side of the account he rightly selects the
defence of Admiral Byng as the most disinterested action of Dodington's long career.
Add to that that Lady Hervey really liked him, and that he used a steel machine with
which to pick up his handkerchief.</p>

<h4 class="left">AN OXFORD SCHOLAR: INGRAM BYWATER, 1840&ndash;1914. By <span class="smcap">W. W. Jackson</span>,
D.D. Clarendon Press. 1917. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>There are probably a good many people who know something about Jowett and have
read several works of Gilbert Murray's, and yet could not even guess who was the Regius
Professor of Greek at Oxford who bridged the gap. It was Bywater. Between two great
popular influences the pendulum took a swing towards scholarship in the strictest
sense, and from 1893 to 1908 the chair was filled by one of the most learned Hellenists
of his day in any land, a man less great indeed than Scaliger and Bentley and the present
Professor of Latin at Cambridge, but assuredly of their type. Those three rank even
higher, not so much because they are more "brilliant" as because their interest in the
classics is primarily the literary one. They apply their criticism and interpretation to
the more purely literary authors, and their style has a quality not relevant to scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
scholarship, however welcome there&mdash;it has the creative writer's <i>zest</i>. Bywater's learning
ranged, certainly, over the whole field of Greek prose and poetry; he had, moreover,
a keen interest in literature as such, read the chief contemporary poets and novelists, and
had views about them; he was master of an admirable Latin style; but his ruling passion
was not literature so much as knowledge, and it was in the philosophic writers that he
found his special field. For that reason his most characteristic work may be said to be
his edition of Aristotle's <i>Ethics</i>, published in 1890. At the same time, that by which
he is deservedly best known is an edition of a work on the borderland between philosophy
and literature, Aristotle's <i>Poetics</i>, to which he supplied, in 1909, an English
paraphrase and a fully explanatory commentary, both the best things of their kind for
any student of that work; and as these will always be many, the book's future seems
assured.</p>

<p>"Bywater," writes a relative, "was always studying"; and again, in words of
insight, "but if he were not actually a genius he was far from being merely a learned
man." His enlightenment and humanity are brought out in Dr. Jackson's admirable
little biography, which, as the story of a scholar who died soon after the European
War began, seems worth commending now. Though he disliked what we know as
Liberalism, the word is the right one for his educational views; he supported the
abolition of University religious tests, and was against compulsory Greek. Further than
that it is not applicable; he was a Tariff Reformer. As an undergraduate he belonged to
the famous "Old Mortality Club." He was a friend and disciple of Mark Pattison, and,
like him, married a lady who was an excellent scholar and at the same time humane and
charming. Of Walter Pater he was a friend and no disciple; "his style I do not like:
it seems to me affected and pretentious and often sadly wanting in lucidity." In congenial
company one of the most sociable of men, he showed much kindness to promising
young scholars. Some of the <i>mots</i> ascribed to him are rather donnish, but not all: "I
often think that modern education is a conspiracy on the part of schoolmasters
and dons to keep men babies until they are four-and-twenty" is profounder than
it looks; and he realised that "those who care for manuscripts <i>per se</i> are usually dull
dogs."</p>

<p>All through his life he was a great bibliophile, and even in this respect happily mated.
Few wives would pack their husbands off to Paris immediately after breakfast to inspect
a copy of the <i>editio princeps</i> of Homer, and when they returned with it the following
evening give it to them for a birthday-present. But he possessed something even more
remarkable than that (for of Homer there are, after all, other editions); in his copy of
Melanchthon's <i>De Anima</i> was an autograph of Rabelais.</p>

<h4 class="left">SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY LIFE IN THE COUNTRY PARISH. By <span class="smcap">Eleanor
Trotter</span>, M.A. Cambridge University Press. 10<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This book has one serious fault: there is not enough of it. Miss Trotter gives a feast
of good things, suggests so many interesting happenings of the period, that she might
have expanded almost every page into three, and still we might ask for more. It is,
however, confined strictly to showing how the ordinary business of government was
carried on during this troubled century. Readers will find good exercise for the imagination
in filling in the outlines. Take this for example: "The beadle's chief work was of
a punitive nature; he was expected to help the constable in apprehending and punishing
rogues; he wore a special dress, and carried a whip or wand in his hand with which he
drove the dogs out of church." A footnote says: "In 1887 at Wensley Church the
wands were still to be seen. They were six in number, and were attached to the front
of the churchwardens' high pews." The vestry book at Pittington, page 104, shows this
entry: "Maie 3, 1646, John Lazing was appointed to be bedel for driving doggs out of
the church in time of public worship, and other necessary dutys." The office of church-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>warden
was then of great importance, and carried with it the dignity of a special "high
pew," a matter of moment when the seating arrangements in church almost created a
table of precedence. But why did the dogs of those days show such a church-going
disposition? The beadle's office to-day would be a sinecure, for during many years of
regular attendance the writer has only twice seen a dog in church.</p>

<p>The next page refers to "Rogue Money," the colloquial term for a contribution not
exceeding 6<i>d.</i> or 8<i>d.</i> a week levied on Sunday on the parish for the maintenance of poor
prisoners in the county gaol. A further levy of not less than 20<i>s.</i> per annum from the
whole North Riding was made for the relief of poor prisoners of the King's Bench and
Marshalsea. Even taking into account the greater value of money then, this would not
go far among destitute prisoners, but it is somewhat surprising to find that any provision
at all was made in those hard days.</p>

<p>The temptation to go on extracting these vignettes is great, but must be resisted.
Surprises of this sort, however, are numerous, and when we remember the lack of hard
roads, the absence of any postal facilities, and the difficulties and cost of any sort of
communication, it is astounding to find how well acquainted the local justices were
with the statutes, and to what an extent they succeeded in administering them.
Miss Trotter's investigations have evidently much impressed this upon her, and her
preface gives an excellent summary of the conclusions at which she has arrived.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The great majority of the men who took their share in the government of England in
the seventeenth century had neither learning nor culture; some probably were not able to
write their own names; nevertheless, through being made responsible for the well-being and
good order of the little community to which they belonged, they gained a considerable amount
of political education. The work of local government, carried on voluntarily from father to
son through untold generations, has produced certain characteristics&mdash;a moderation of
outlook, a reasonableness and sanity of mind, an intensely critical faculty and a political
insight&mdash;which are typical of our race.... There is a fear lest the masses through
ignorance of the work of their forefathers may demand a centralisation of governmental
functions, which is alien to the character of the English Constitution.</p></blockquote>

<p>The author has earned public thanks for bringing to light these interesting records
of an interesting period. It should be compulsory for every education authority to use
this and similar works as part of the historical instruction given in all our schools. Such
books would clothe the dry bones of history, as ordinarily taught, in a so much more
attractive garb that lessons might become a pleasure instead of a penance. The Royal
Commission on Public Records received a letter from M. Paul Meyer, of the Ecole des
Chartes, in which he says: "<i>En Angleterre tout est en désordre</i>," referring to our widely
scattered and unorganised records. This Royal Commission is doing a great service in
trying to bring order out of chaos, but it is not its function to do for the general reader
what a book like this may do&mdash;bring to life in a handy and digested form some of the
buried records of our past.</p>

<span class="smcap">Leese</span>. Allen &amp; Unwin. 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Among all the ignorances of the British public there is none more calamitous than its
ignorance of the Balkan peoples and of their importance in European politics. We
persist even now in lumping them together as a set of semi-savage tribes, who may be
manipulated by the civilised Powers in this way or that, but who ultimately will have to
fight it out among themselves like the Kilkenny cats. Any book that is not mere partisan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
propaganda, that will throw light on that dark corner of Europe, is to be welcomed.
And this little volume, slight though it is, is all to the point. Its authors are experts,
and practical experts, in their subject. Mr. Noel Buxton especially has known the Balkans,
as few Englishmen have known them, for twenty years, and in the early days of the war
he went there as the accredited agent of the British Government to try to attach
Bulgaria to our cause. The story of our diplomatic failure is sketched for
us in rapid outline. "Allied diplomacy," Messrs. Buxton and Leese say, "exerted
no comprehensive activity, but at intervals made isolated efforts to please one State or
another by promises, some of which proved only contradictory and embarrassing to
action in another direction demanded by circumstances a little later." We were handicapped,
they say, by the policy of Russia. We were handicapped also by ill-grounded
fears of alienating Serbia and Greece. The final chapters of the book deal with the future
prospects in the Balkans. They were written before the conclusion of the Bulgarian
Treaty, and most of the things which they deprecate have found a place in that Treaty.
Many Englishmen will not regret this; but no reader of Mr. Buxton will believe
that his plea for Bulgaria is based on hostility to Serbia or Greece or Rumania, or,
indeed, on anything but a single-minded desire for lasting peace in the Balkans.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE SKILLED LABOURER, 1760&ndash;1832. By <span class="smcap">J. L. Hammond</span> and <span class="smcap">Barbara
Hammond</span>. Longmans. 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This book is the third of Mr. and Mrs. Hammond's important studies of that period
of English history which fell between 1760 and 1832. Together with <i>The Village Labourer</i>
and <i>The Town Labourer</i> it makes a remarkable trilogy. It is marked by the same scholarly
research, the same vividness of presentation, the same polished style as its predecessors.
Some readers may perhaps find it of slightly less general interest: if it is so, it is simply
because its scope is rather more limited. In <i>The Village Labourer</i> the authors gave an
account of the enclosures of common lands and of the agricultural labourers' rising of
1830; in <i>The Town Labourer</i> they drew a very striking picture of the civilisation of the
time, of the governing classes as well as of the poor, of the new social and economic
conditions. The present volume gives us the history of certain selected bodies of workers
during the same period. It is, in fact, a detailed account of the Northumberland and
Durham miners, the cotton and woollen and worsted operatives, the Spitalfields silk-weavers,
and the framework knitters, together with a very full description of the Luddite
risings in the Midlands and in Lancashire and Yorkshire. Mr. and Mrs. Hammond
have made very large use of the Home Office Papers, and they have been able to throw
a great deal of new light on their subject. Their tale is, of course, a gloomy one&mdash;a tale
of desperate struggles against grinding poverty and serfdom, of wages, often family
wages, of 10s. a week or less in times of dear living, of a working day of anything from
twelve to eighteen hours, of tiny children in the mines and the mills, of passionate
strikes and brutal repressions. The chapters on the Luddite riots are of especial importance:
they are the best, if not the only, connected account of that little-known episode
in the annals of industry. They will remove the wrong impression, which, as Mr. and
Mrs. Hammond say, is widely prevalent, that these troubles originated in Nottingham
over the introduction of new and improved stocking-frames. In fact, the cause was not
new machines at all, but the adaptation of old machines to the manufacture of a new
and inferior kind of article. And the workmen had the sympathy and support of many
of the employers in their campaign against the degradation of the industry. Not the
least remarkable feature of the story of Luddism is the part played by spies and <i>agents
provocateurs</i>. The military, the local magistrates, and the Government all had their
spies, and the wide extent of the mischief done by those vile creatures is very thoroughly
exposed by Mr. and Mrs. Hammond. One of them, by name Oliver, <i>alias</i> Richards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
<i>alias</i> Hollis, has a chapter all to himself. He was "a person of genteel appearance and
good address, nearly six feet high, of erect figure, light hair, red and rather large whiskers,
and a full face, a little pitted with the small-pox. His usual dress was a light fashionable-coloured
brown coat, black waistcoat, dark-blue mixture pantaloons, and Wellington
boots." He was a special pet of Lord Sidmouth, and in 1817 he performed the inestimable
services of fomenting sedition in the Midlands and the North and of getting quite
a number of poor and ignorant men hanged, transported, or imprisoned.</p>

<p>Altogether, <i>The Skilled Labourer</i> is a book which puts every student of history very
deeply in the debt of Mr. and Mrs. Hammond.</p>

<h4 class="left">IN THE SIDE SHOWS: OBSERVATIONS BY A FLIER ON FIVE FRONTS.
By <span class="smcap">Captain Wedgwood Benn</span>, M.P., D.S.O., D.F.C. Hodder &amp; Stoughton.
12<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Captain Wedgwood Benn's experiences in the side shows may well fill with envy those
whose lot was cast in the main theatre of the war. We confess that we took up his book
rather doubtfully&mdash;for who was not long ago surfeited with stories from the front?
But we found it, after all, full of diverting adventures in many lands, as well as in the
water and the air. It is written straightforwardly, without that straining after effect
which marred so many of its kind. Captain Benn began his military career in 1914 in
the Middlesex Yeomanry. He was bored, like every one else, at Ismailia: he fought
and was bored again at Gallipoli. Then he was fortunate enough to get into the Naval
Air Service. He flew in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. He bombed the Turks
near Aden, passed the time of day over the telephone to the King of the Hedjâz at
Mecca, made a brief "Cook's Tour" to the Sudan and was presently "observing" in
Palestine, blowing up portions of the Bagdad Railway, and commanding an astounding
mixed force of British soldiers and French sailors in Castelorizo, near Adalin. After
this he comes home on leave, gets his "wings," and is off to Taranto to join the
Adriatic Barrage, the aerial force whose task was to keep the Austrian submarines
out of the Mediterranean. Finally, after Caporetto, he is on the Piave fronts
attached to General Plumer's force. He apparently managed from there to do a good
deal of sight-seeing up and down Italy, and he has some amusing tales of the people and
places he visited. He also took part in the melodramatic adventure of Alessandro Tandura,
the Italian spy who was dropped from an aeroplane in the Austrian lines. This is the
best adventure in the book, and must be read to be properly appreciated.</p>

<p>Now and then Captain Benn interrupts his narrative to discuss an idea or a problem.
The most notable of these interludes is his criticism of our military system. He can find
little to say in praise of it. The much-vaunted discipline seems to him to mean only
mechanical obedience. The "system" puts a premium on waste of time, on the "spit
and polish" spirit; it discourages ideas, imagination, initiative. And most of the higher
officers are monuments of stupidity and ignorance. In all this there is no doubt much
truth. But a good many of his readers will suspect that Captain Benn was exceptionally
unfortunate in the senior officers he met.</p>

<h4 class="left">IRELAND A NATION. By <span class="smcap">Robert Lynd</span>. Grant Richards. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Many Englishmen are now sick of the "Irish Question"; many are ashamed of it.
Some have argued an inconsistency between our attitude to Poland or Czecho-Slovakia
or Jugo-Slavia and our attitude to Ireland. Others have come to feel that damage is
done to our reputation abroad, both among friends and enemies, by our Irish policy. Mr.
Lynd knows how to gauge public opinion here as well as in Ireland, and he seizes the
opportunity to press home the point that the Irish problem is an international<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
problem. His argument, which is as closely reasoned as it is eloquent, is that England
can save herself and save the world only by saving Ireland. What does saving Ireland
mean? "It means," says Mr. Lynd, "the immediate surrender of Ireland into the
hands of the Irish people, to rule it either as a republic or a dominion, according as the
people themselves decide."</p>

<p>Many, of course, made up their minds on the matter long ago; but Mr. Lynd is by
no means satisfied with all who profess themselves friends of Ireland. He has some
pungent remarks on what he calls "the hesitating sort of Liberal" who wants to give
Ireland a carefully-conditioned measure of self-government which will prevent her from
abusing her liberty or inconveniencing England. But there are others who are still
baffled by Ulster. It is not that they think of the Irish as "a mob of Celts" instead of as
a nation. The trouble is that we are apparently confronted by two nations&mdash;two irreconcilable
nations. What has Mr. Lynd to say to that? He says firstly, bluntly, that Ulstermen
are Irishmen, and that "the Ulster question" is an invention of British Statesmen.
"Cabinet Ministers have no moral objection whatever to coercing Ireland. If they have
any objection to coercing Ulster, it is not on moral grounds, but because Ulster provides
them with a plausible palliation for their guilt in denying freedom to a race of white
men." He cannot, of course, disregard the Ulstermen's fear of Home Rule. He can only
argue that it is an utterly unreasonable fear; for "Ulster is much more likely to
dominate an Irish Parliament than to be dominated by it."</p>

<p>Mr. Lynd does not confine himself to the mere politician. He has much that is of
profound interest to say on the Irish soldier, on Ireland's record in the war, on Irish
literature, and Irish poetry. His book is one which ought to be read by everyone who
cares for Ireland&mdash;and still more by those who do not.</p>

By <span class="smcap">Clough Williams-Ellis</span>, with an Introduction by Mr. <span class="smcap">St. Loe Strachey</span>.
Published by <i>Country Life</i>, London. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p class="in0">This little volume of unassuming proportions marks a period in the evolution of housing
the people of this country. Perhaps the word <i>revolution</i> is more apt in this connection,
for it indicates either a reversal of the wheel of time, taking us back to ancient methods,
or a completion of the circle, bringing us round again to the use of building materials
which Nature has provided to the hand of the builder. The author addresses himself
particularly "to those who have in the past built only with stone, brick, concrete,
timber, and plaster, etc.," but there are many people to-day thinking of building who
never thought of it before; for the scarcity of houses (not merely of the five-roomed
cottage but of the ten or twelve-roomed middle-class house), with the consequent
inevitable increase in rent, to say nothing of the contumely of house-agents and their
kind, are giving rise to a wonder if there is no alternative to tenancy. To all such this
book will be of value, for not only will it widen the field of possibility, but it is packed
with definite facts, which have involved much labour in their compilation. To build
with either of the materials named in its title will appear to the uninitiated, i.e., to all
those who only think of brick and stone houses, as being worthy of the man who "built
his house upon the sand"; but plenty of instances are given to show that if proper though
simple methods of construction are followed, such houses will last for many generations.
We well remember our surprise when, some twenty years ago, we first saw in Leicestershire
and Warwickshire a number of what were locally termed "mud" cottages, and
found on enquiry that many of them were from two to three hundred years old.</p>

<p>Building by-laws effectually put a stop to the use of any such materials as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
under consideration, wherever by-laws were in operation. They were looked upon by
the officials of many local authorities and by other well-meaning but short-sighted
people as a gleam of sunshine on a dark world: they were to check jerry-building and
prevent bad housing. Though this ray of light first shed its beams upon a startled
world so long ago as 1858, through the Local Government Act of that year, we are now
discovering that jerry-building is as rampant as ever, housing conditions are, in very
many places, execrable, and that by-laws sometimes only act as a deterrent to men
who want to build. Parliament in its wisdom has passed quite a number of Acts since the
year named dealing with the subject, which might have been admirable if they could
have been administered by supermen. As, however, this duty fell to the lot of ordinary
mortals, by-laws have actually prevented the use of improved methods and materials,
which happened to be unknown at the time the old ones were drawn up. These have
been somewhat relaxed in recent years, but even to-day it is to be feared that a serious
proposal to build with Pisé, or Cob, might cause the sudden death of many respected
representatives of Bumbledom. The Ministry of Health have expressed the view that
further relaxation in the direction of allowing such materials might be permitted, but
many local authorities would, we suppose, require more than that to induce them to
adopt the suggestion.</p>

<p>For the moment cost is of even more importance than longevity, and if the usual
materials are to be insisted upon the building of cottages and small houses on economic
lines is impossible. Transport is one of the large items in the cost of construction; but
if the heaviest and bulkiest materials are on the spot, this item can be almost entirely
eliminated. It is, therefore, not unreasonable to hope that local authorities will give
every facility, nay, encouragement, to use any suitable material, rather than insist upon
the letter of their by-laws. The author's view is as follows, but it must be borne in mind
that the builder is not always a free agent:</p>

<p>Formerly he who carried bricks into Merioneth or the Cotswolds, or slates into Kent, or
ragstone-rubble into Middlesex, was guilty of no more than foolishness and an æsthetic
solecism. Under present conditions such action should render him liable to prosecution and
conviction on some such count as "wasting the shrunken resources of his country in a time
of great scarcity."</p>

<p>Mr. St. Loe Strachey contributes an instructive and amusing preface, the humour
of it giving point to his own experiences. No one has done more than he in trying to
find the cheapest suitable material for cottages; in Pisé he has rediscovered the very
thing he wanted. As one who served under his chairmanship on the Committee of the
First Cheap Cottage Exhibition at Letchworth Garden City in 1905, the present
reviewer is glad to offer a tribute to his persistence and success. The illustrations in
this book are both interesting and instructive.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE MYSTERY OF EASTER ISLAND: THE STORY OF AN EXPEDITION.
By <span class="smcap">Mrs. Scoresby Routledge</span>. Sifton, Praed, &amp; Co. 31<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p class="in0">Any map of the Pacific will show a minute dot standing by itself far to the eastward of
any other island south of the line, yet some 2000 miles away from the American coast.
This is Easter Island, long famous as a land of archæological wonders. Apart from these
it is an unattractive place, consisting of a triangular patch of volcanic rock, grass-covered,
bare of trees, waterless but for the rain that collects in the craters of its extinct
volcanoes, and, of course, wind-swept and harbourless. At present it serves as a cattle-ranch
managed in the interests of a Chilian company, the natives, no more than 250 in
all, being huddled into a single village on the west coast in order to keep them out of
mischief. Formerly, however, there were enough of them to form ten clans, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
kept things merry with their local feuds. The navigators of the eighteenth century,
Roggeveen, who discovered the island, Gonzalez, Cook, and La Pérouse, estimate their
number at anything from 700 up to 2000 souls.</p>

<p>How, then, in such a solitary spot, inhabited by a handful of savages, does it happen
that hundreds of giant statues of stone are to be found, not to speak of smaller statues
of wood, curious rock-carvings, and finally a script? A few passers-by had pleasantly
trifled with the problem, but a serious attempt to solve it had not been made until Mr.
and Mrs. Scoresby Routledge gallantly resolved to take the matter in hand. The task
before them was no light one; for in order to study Easter Island one must first get
there. So a yacht, the <i>Mana</i>, was built for the purpose. The Polynesian word means
"luck," and luck certainly attended the little vessel on its long run of 100,000 miles.
Quite apart from the account given of Easter Island itself, the log of the voyage provides
the matter for a fascinating book, proving as it does that there are many odd corners of
the much-betravelled earth which still await exploration. This becomes apparent as
soon as Magellan Strait is traversed, and the ship hazardously works her way north
through the intricate uncharted channels that run up the western coast of Patagonia. It
was hereabouts, by the way, that the <i>Dresden</i>, after the Falkland fight, played hide-and-seek
with our gunboats for several months. Helped by many striking illustrations, we
are enabled to picture to ourselves the deep gorges overlooked by snowy peaks, and the
gaunt half-naked Indians that these waters precariously support. Afterwards Selkirk's
Island, Juan Fernandez, was visited, and when the Easter Island investigations were complete,
the expedition went on to Pitcairn, the home of the descendants of the <i>Bounty</i>
mutineers, an incidental consequence being that King George in due course received at
Buckingham Palace two loyal representatives of this, the smallest of British Colonies.
But space would fail if we dwelt further on the nautical side of the adventure, complicated
as it was by the fact that during the greater part of the three years and four
months during which it lasted there were German foes above and below water to be
circumvented. Even Easter Island, it must be added, proved no haven of refuge, for
first von Spee's squadron and subsequently the armed cruiser <i>Prinz Eitel Friedrich</i>
paid a call there, though luckily Mana was away on both occasions.</p>

<p>Passing to the archæology, we must begin by gratefully recording the fact that at
length an adequate description is available of the monuments as they exist to-day.
Thanks to the maps, plans, and pictures, every detail is brought home to the reader;
while he cannot complain that Mrs. Routledge's commentary, precise though it be, is
ever dull. She is indeed to be congratulated on having composed a popular account that
is likewise as far as it goes scientifically sound; though it is to be hoped that the whole
collection of evidence, of which but a digest is presented here, will hereafter be published.
The expedition was evidently at great pains to survey, catalogue, measure, photograph,
and, so far as was necessary, actually disinter, the entire mass of remains, despite their
great number and the considerable extent of country over which they are distributed.
And fortunately the stonework is still there to be studied, since it cannot be easily
removed or destroyed, as has mostly been the fate of the woodwork, namely, the carved
human figures, twenty to thirty inches high, with their characteristic goatee beards and
prominent ribs, and the tablets on which the script was carved. Yet, if not altogether
demolished, the statues are in large part dethroned. Those at least that decorated the
burial platforms of Cyclopean architecture that border the coast are all overthrown;
how and why we can but guess. On the other hand, there is a certain volcanic hill with
many huge figures still standing, both within the crater and along its outer skirts. It
was here that all the images were quarried; and many exist in a half-finished condition,
while some, including the largest of all, sixty-six feet in length, were perhaps never
meant to be completely detached from the parent rock. Excavation at these quarries
revealed the whole process of manufacture, and proved that with stone tools it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
possible to hew the soft rock into shape, though the precise manner of the transportation
and erection of the unwieldy monsters, while plainly creditable to human muscle,
remains by no means easy to discern.</p>

<p>Who were the makers? What did they mean to represent? At this point we pass from
description to explanation, from the ascertained to the purely conjectural. Certain it is
that the present natives have no use for the statues, and are not only ignorant but likewise
incurious about their origin. Even by Cook's time, namely, in 1774, though still
standing, they were apparently ceasing to be respected; whereas Roggeveen, in 1722,
rightly or wrongly, saw in them objects of an existing worship. Thus we seem to get at
least a downward limit for the epoch during which they were part of the living culture,
and this view is borne out by the relatively unweathered condition of some statues.
It would look, then, as if the direct and not very remote ancestors of the present
islanders were the image-makers, and not some mysterious extinct race, such as has
often been postulated. Further, the pendant ear-lobes of the statues recall a practice
hardly yet obsolete among the population of to-day.</p>

<p>The best argument of all, however, amongst those making for a connection with the
indigenous culture is derived from the study of a remarkable bird-cult which it is a
chief triumph of the expedition to have rescued from oblivion. Not only can it be thus
shown to the point of demonstration that the rock-carvings occurring in a deserted
village of stone houses on the south-western headland of the island represent the annual
"bird-man" who got the first egg of a sacred bird, and so became himself highly
sacred; but it can also be made a probable corollary that the statues of the image-mountain
are memorials of bird-men, since it was close by that the bird-man must abide in
strict seclusion for the five months in which his sacredness was at its height. Indeed,
many are the clues which are afforded by a close examination of this curious custom.
Thus it seems certain that the present cult which centres round the Sooty Tern is
derived from the worship of the Frigate Bird as practised in far-off Melanesia. The
Frigate Bird, too, seems to have suggested various symbols belonging to the script.
The inference is that there is a Melanesian stratum in the population; though, as a
Polynesian immigration must also be assumed in order to account for the language,
responsibility for the culture as a whole must somehow be divided between the two
parties. All these difficult questions, we fear, cannot be thrashed out within the limits
of a brief review. Yet perhaps enough has been said to induce every student of the wider
history of man not to miss a golden opportunity of learning that anthropology and
romance are sisters.</p>

<p>England has a high tradition in books on popular science. Men like Faraday and Tyndall
did not consider it beneath them to write for children and laymen, and their books on
the elementary facts of science are models of their kind. Strangely enough&mdash;or naturally
enough&mdash;the best expositors of the elements of a science are, in general, those who have
themselves contributed to the advances of that science, while those who are professedly
popularisers present the subject not only less correctly and logically but also less simply
and pleasantly. The books before us confirm this opinion.</p>

<p>Mr. Gibson is a practised hand at writing books for children, the volume before us
being the sixth of a series. He has the merit that he attempts to bring before the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
the experimental basis of the science of chemistry and some of its historical aspects,
and does not make a series of dogmatic statements without reference to the researches
on which they rest, as does Bishop Mercer. He describes many experiments, and gives
diagrams to illustrate them. The book covers a wide field of interesting and, for the
most part, elementary chemical phenomena. The chief fault which we have to find is
with the style in which it is written. We find the imaginary questions put to the writer
by boys and girls distinguished as big, little, facially peculiar, and so on, irritating, and
we very much doubt if his patronising manner will find favour with most boys, who, we
believe, prefer to be treated as friends who happen not to know. We do not pretend to
Mr. Gibson's knowledge of children, but base our criticism on the fact that Faraday
and most of his successors at the Royal Institution have managed to interest and instruct
their juvenile audiences without this painfully evident condescension.</p>

<p>Bishop Mercer's method of striving to excite the wonder of his young readers is based
upon a liberal use of notes of exclamation (seldom less than three on a page, and sometimes
three together, for extra effect) and of the words "wonder" and "wonderful,"
together with the constant citation of very large numbers, which fill him with awe&mdash;"A
million is bad enough with its six cyphers. But eighteen of them&mdash;that is awful&mdash;it is a
million million million!" The machinery of nature, as revealed by modern science,
does not impress him as do these rows of cyphers. If there were any serious attempt to
show how they have been arrived at we should think more highly of the educational
value of the book. As it is, the information is often incorrect on quite simple matters&mdash;water
does <i>not</i> occupy "exactly" (or approximately) "the same space as before"
after sugar has been added to it; hydrogen is not often regarded, in these days when it
has been solidified, as a metal. Often the book is most misleading, as in the description
of how the author saw a man's ribs by X-rays when the "machine" was put the other
side of the man in question. No mention is made of any phosphorescent screen, and the
inexperienced reader is led to infer by the analogy given that he actually saw through the
man. The style is vague and slipshod in the extreme, a typical sentence being, "The
elasticity of the atoms is so perfect that they always bang about just the same." We will
not criticise the Bishop's theology, or his philosophy, which insists that "what you
really see is not the matter of the tree, but the ether-quiverings which that matter throws
off." We will, however, take it upon ourselves to suggest that, if he should decide to
write another book on elementary science, he should model himself rather upon Faraday's
"Lectures Upon the Physical Forces" than upon an American temperance lecture.</p>

<p>Mr. Mills' book on <i>The Realities of Modern Science</i> is in a different class from the two
already noticed, and is intended for adult readers. It gives a sketch of modern conceptions
of the composition of matter, the electron theory, and the recent experimental
work on the magnitude of molecules and electrons. The early chapters of the book are
devoted to a very brief but excellent treatment of certain aspects of the history of
physical science. A great merit of the book is that it devotes particular attention to the
recent important advances in molecular physics, which are neither yet included in the
text-books nor easily available in popular form. We may mention especially the work of
Millikan on the electronic charge, that of the Braggs and Moseley on X-ray spectra,
and the photographs taken by C. T. R. Wilson (whose name is not, however, mentioned)
of the paths of α {a} and β {b} particles and of X-rays. The style is simple and sober, and the
author, who hails from the research laboratories of the Western Electric Company,
wisely leaves the results which he describes to produce their own impression. The
book is, of course, written for more advanced readers than the others here noticed,
but, all the same, an intelligent schoolboy with a smattering of scientific knowledge
would, in all probability, prefer it to the books written expressly for his benefit. The
adult reader is not likely to find a better presentation of the more striking aspects of
modern physics.</p>

<h2>BOOK-PRODUCTION NOTES</h2>

<p class="center">By J. H. MASON</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">LAST</span> month, in laying down the chief matters to be considered in producing a
satisfactory book, I began with type. And as if the subject were in the air,
as it were in solution, I find it precipitated in the form of an important article
in the pages of the <i>Saturday Review</i>. An illustrated article, too, with specimens
of the chief types referred to. This is all to the good; if this example is followed
by other literary journals we shall soon form a right opinion in the lay public on what
is a good type. The appearance of our books will be improved, the offensive advertisement&mdash;I
am speaking typographically&mdash;will lose its vulgarity, and public lettering in
posters, shop names, and street signs will reflect the improvement.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is interesting to note that my view on the importance of the work of the private
presses is also confirmed by the article referred to, and that their work is beginning to
influence the typefounders, however tardily.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It is quite frequently said that it costs no more to print from good type than from
bad. We might go further in the case of certain bad types and say that their use sends up
the cost of printing. For when "modern" type of the extreme form is used, as De Vinne
pointed out, their hair-lines are soon battered by any inequality in the paper and print
imperfectly, or involve a loss of time in changing the damaged letters. The attempt to
emulate the hair-line of the engraver of plate lettering is altogether misplaced in relief
or letterpress printing.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The Victorian greyness of page led some printers and publishers to resort to the use
of heavier type to give their pages a richer black. But almost all the heavier types at
their disposal had been designed for display lines in advertisements, and went too far in
the thickening of the line. Even Morris's "Golden" type, excellent as it is in his use of
it, is too heavy to be adopted as the staple type-face of our printing.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Not till quite recently have type-faces of the right weight for bookwork been designed
and placed on the general market. The work of the American Goudy, the type cut by
Mr. Prince (who cut the punches for the Kelmscott, the Doves, and other celebrated
founts) for Messrs. Shanks and christened "Dolphin," and some of the modern versions
of Venetian founts are pretty satisfactory and generally available.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>With the exception of the Monotype Company, who designed an excellent modified
"old style" type for the "Imprint," the composing machines that produce our newspapers,
journals, and a large proportion of our books have repeated the stock designs
originally made for movable or hand-set type. It is very desirable that they should not
limit themselves to these, and the instance mentioned above is a most encouraging one
to follow up.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The <i>Studio</i> has just issued a special number dealing with modern woodcuts and
lithographs&mdash;British and French. This is the first attempt to collect representative work
of modern artists who practise wood-cutting. The revival of the woodcut in book
illustration demands special discussion. This will form the subject of next month's
Notes à propos of the <i>Studio</i> Woodcut Number.</p>

<h2 class="b0">A LETTER FROM FRANCE</h2>

<h3 class="p0">THE FRENCH POETRY OF TO-DAY</h3>

<p class="sigright">
<i>Paris, December, 1919</i><br />
</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">FRENCH</span> poetry has not been renewed since the Symbolist Movement by any
new and powerfully original poet. Besides, the Symbolist Movement is not
finished, and it is in its spirit, in its influence, in its metric, that our poetry
still lives to-day. The majority of the best French poets have passed the age
of forty and come from Symbolist circles. The influence of the four Symbolist
masters, of after 1870, Rimbaud, Laforgue, Mallarmé, and Verlaine, is still visible. A
sleeper, like Wells's character, who fell asleep in 1898 and woke up twenty years
afterwards, would find poetry much as he left it and with the same essential names.</p>

<p>He would see only that a reign has ended and that another head wears the crown on
the coinage; but this by itself is not in the ordinary way a capital event. In his time the
name of the prince of the poets was Mallarmé. To-day his name is Paul Fort; and it is
very obvious that there is hardly any resemblance between the two. But our sleeper
would very well remember having known Paul Fort at the Thursdays in the rue de
Rome and in the <i>Mercure</i>, and having once read five or six volumes of <i>Ballades</i>, among
them what was perhaps the poet's masterpiece, the astonishing <i>Roman de Louis XI</i>. The
prince has nothing absolutely novel to show except his crown.</p>

<p>The sleeper would then ask news of the prince who reigned in his time, and would
learn that in the year when he closed his eyes for twenty years Mallarmé closed them
for ever.</p>

<p>One of the numerous surprises of the war was the sudden return of the purest and
most authentic of the disciples of Mallarmé, M. Paul Valéry, to the poetry which he
had abandoned for twenty years. M. Valéry then produced that admirable pendant to
Mallarmé's <i>Hérodiade</i> which is called <i>La Jeune Parque</i>, and he published in reviews a
few poems that connoisseurs cut out and keep jealously as once they did the sonnets of
Hérédia. The volume, which will doubtless appear in a short time, will be published
by the <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i>, and will be a jewel of the same kind as the poems of
Mallarmé, and will make the second peak of a double snow-covered Parnassus. Another
disciple of Mallarmé, M. Jean Royère, has published a collection of poems, <i>Par la
lumière peints</i>, that the master of Valvins would have loved. One finds in them a curious
contrast between a somewhat cold and Parnassian form and a beautiful mobility of
images which change without ceasing one into the other.</p>

<p>The sleeper, happy to see that the spirit of Mallarmé is still alive, would ask news of
the two poets who were in 1898 the leaders of the Symbolist school, M. Henri de
Régnier and M. Viélé Griffin. "They still make an honourable figure," we should
answer, "but the twenty years during which you have been asleep have not added
much to what is essential to their work. In 1898 they had already written all their most
beautiful verses, those that your generation knew by heart, which made indeed two
original visions of the world."</p>

<p>"I remember, also," the sleeper would continue, "two other poets who were
frequently named together and who, if they did not resemble one another in their
inspirations, resembled one another in their life apart and their solitary work. One of
them lived in a little town of the Pyrenees, and painted there with a naive fervour
like that of Francis of Assisi, and also with the irony of a shrewd observer, the things and
the faces of his quiet life, the animals and the people of his small countryside. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
Francis Jammes. The other had made at the age of eighteen or twenty two tragic masks
shining with genius, <i>Tête d'or</i> and <i>La Ville</i>. Then he went as consul to China and elsewhere.
We received sometimes from him strange things, printed at Fou-Tcheou by a
widow named Rosario. This was Paul Claudel. Are they still of this world?" "Of this
poetical world and of another world still: these are to-day our two great Catholic poets.
These in the last twenty years have, all the same, produced new works that you could
not have looked for in 1898. But they also belong to the generation that you knew, and
all of Claudel was already potentially in <i>Tête d'or</i>, as all of Jammes was potentially in
the trilogy of the <i>Poète</i>."</p>

<p>"Am I myself," the sleeper will ask, "an image of this poetry? Has it, like me, been
asleep for twenty years or repeating itself indefinitely?" "Not altogether, but it has
added nothing essential, except this little in Claudel and Jammes, to what was
germinating or flourishing in the garden of 1898." "I understand. You must have been
for twenty years one of these happy people who have no history. France has lived
peaceful days. And this united and undisturbed life has proved favourable to the
continuity of the poetic routine?" "Not at all, O Epimenides. You went to sleep
precisely when France was beginning the Dreyfus affair, which was a famous earthquake,
and you wake at the moment when we are emerging from a world-wide war
which has killed a dozen million men on our planet, and which has given to Europe
the appearance you can see here, on the wall, on this map." "And all this has not yet
produced any new poets? And, in 1919, when my eyes open again to the light, you send
me back where I was in 1898, you give me again all my old poets and none but them,
and the great news is that Mallarmé's workshop is open again, that the attention of the
poetical world is hung on the new <i>Hérodiade</i>, which M. Valéry is exhibiting there!
That is a stupefying thing which is enough to wake up a sleeper, which might even
wake up a dead man!"</p>

<p>"Well, my dear sir, poetry has its own logic. The war has, we know, been favourable
for those who trade in iron; learn also that it has been an age of gold for those who trade in
diamonds. It has pleased us to hold in our hands the diamonds of former times. But be
reassured. The war has sometimes brought into the poetic light a kind of iron which is
not without beauty. We have had true war poets. The <i>Hymns</i> of Joachim Gasquet make
a superb book. He is certainly not attached to the Symbolist Movement. Gasquet is a
southerner, a classic, a man with sonorous lungs, with an unquenchable abundance of
oratory. The book of this poet from Aix seems as though it were written by a Mirabeau
of the trenches."</p>

<p>"But in 1898 I knew Gasquet pretty well, I read his verses. They resembled most
closely those of Emmanuel Signoret, and they were very beautiful. Can you only quote
to me these ghosts of my own time? Are there, then, no young men?"</p>

<p>"Here are the poems of Henri Ghéon, delicate in their harmony, pure in their
emotion, <i>Foi en la France</i>."</p>

<p>"I remember Ghéon very well."</p>

<p>"The devil! I forgot that he also was of the group of 1898. All the same, here are
some that will be new to you. Here is <i>Europe</i>, by Jules Romains, in which we find
again the powerful and vigorous poet of the <i>Vie Unanime</i>.</p>

<p>"Here is a charming little book which Louis de Gonzague-Frick wrote in pencil on his
military postcards: it is called <i>Sous le Bélier de Mars</i>. In that book we find again the
succulence and verve of Laurent Tailhade. And you will find them again, in a different
form, in Fernand Fleuret's <i>Falourdin</i>. It is a pity that Georges Duhamel has written
nothing during the war except some admirable books of prose; but that will not prevent
me reminding you of his earlier, beautiful poems in <i>Compagnons</i>. You would also like
Charles Vildrac's <i>Livre d'Amour</i>. You should certainly also read the poems, sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
rather awkward but very original and robust, that Jules Supervieille wrote in South
America. And as dessert I will keep for you that exquisite confection <i>L'Appartement des
Jeunes Filles</i>, by Roger Allard. Together these make a charming bouquet, but I grant
you it is a small one."</p>

<p>Here I end this dialogue, designed to show French poetry stationary in the positions
of twenty years ago. We may end by saying that in thus remaining alive and healthy, in
thriving for a longer period than the Parnassian movement, French symbolism has
made a place for itself which will deserve the respect of posterity. The poetic form
which will take its place is not yet in sight. But that form will surely appear when the
generation of our sleeper has gone down, to the last man, into slumber irrevocable.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> Near East has been opened up by the war, and reports are coming in.
The Augustinian Priory of the Holy Sepulchre, a complex of buildings,
including the Calvary, St. Helen's Chapel, and the Prison of Christ, has
been described by Mr. A. W. Clapham, who, being on military duty in
Jerusalem, recently surveyed the ruins, and succeeded in making an almost
complete plan of the Latin monastery, founded in 1114. Architectural features, both
Western and Byzantine, were noticed, and the hope expressed that cleaning and repair
would soon be undertaken now that the Holy Places are under British protection.
In Babylonia Mr. H. R. Hall has been excavating for the British Museum at Eridu and
Ur of the Chaldees. Work on the former site was begun by Mr. Campbell Thompson
last year, and buildings of the First Dynasty at Ur have been discovered, dating about
2400 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Still earlier finds of Sumerian origin, dating from pre-Semitic times, have
come to light at Tell el-Obeid near Ur, including heads of lions and panthers in copper,
on a bitumen foundation, with inlaid tongues, eyes, and teeth of coloured stone and shell;
and a lion-headed eagle in copper relief, flanked by stags, the group being 8 feet long
and 4 feet high. Nearer home Mr. Reginald Smith has brought forward evidence to
prove that flint daggers belong to the early Bronze Age in Britain, but to the last phase
of the Stone Age in Scandinavia. The earlier daggers point to connection between the
two areas about 2000 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<h3 class="left">THE SOCIETY OF GENEALOGISTS OF LONDON</h3>

<p>Since Her Majesty the Queen graciously consented to become a Patron membership
has considerably increased, and now stands at 377. During the winter papers have been
read as follows: By Mr. Watson-Taylor on "Joan of Arc, Her Relatives and Descendants";
by Mr. Austen-Leigh on "Editing a School Register," Eton to wit; by Dr. G. C.
Peachey on "Bookplates"; and by Mr. George Sherwood on "Pedigrees and Next-of-Kin
Cases," all of which were well attended, and the papers recommended for
publication. A paper is promised by the Rev. T. C. Dale on "Durham Records."
The last <i>Report</i> of the Royal Commission on Public Records has been much discussed,
and measures suggested for getting its recommendations put into practice. Recognition
has been accorded by the British Museum authorities, with the result that the genealogical
papers of the late R. W. Twigge, F.S.A., have been added, with the consent of
Mrs. Twigge, to the Society's collection.</p>

<p>The Society's aim is simply to facilitate research: by making records more accessible,
by forming a collection of printed books, documents, and MSS., and by making a great
index on the card-index system to the less-known records of biographical fact. Application
should be made for the latest Annual Report to the Secretary, at the Society's
Rooms, 5 Bloomsbury Square, W.C.1.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE VASARI SOCIETY</h3>

<p>The Committee of the Vasari Society have decided to resume the publication of their
annual Portfolio in 1920 if enough subscribers are forthcoming. The Society's aim is
to reproduce in facsimile fine drawings by the Old Masters from both public and
private collections. While attempting in the first place to publish less-known drawings
from private collections, it will not forget that the essential aim is to reproduce masterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
drawings rather than secondary pieces of historical interest, and on that account will
draw, as in the past, to a considerable degree on the better-known works in public
collections.</p>

<p>In the first ten years of the Society's work an annual Portfolio was published with an
average of thirty reproductions, covering the fourteenth to the eighteenth centuries.
The new series may be somewhat broader in scope in admitting the nineteenth century,
and allowing "Old Masters" to include any deceased master of acknowledged excellence
in draughtsmanship. Moreover, it is desired to give ampler representation to
draughtsmen of the British School than has been done in the past.</p>

<p>To continue the annual publication at the same subscription of one guinea, it has
been decided to reduce the size of the Portfolio from 18 by 15 to 16 by 11½ inches,
and it is thought that this will be welcomed by members who have little space for the
larger folios. It will not imply reduction in size of the reproductions, which will continue
to be as far as possible facsimile in size and colour, and every effort will be made to
keep up the standard of quality. Intending subscribers should communicate with the
Hon. Secretary, Mr. A. M. Hind, at the British Museum, London, W.C.1. Subscriptions
for 1920 will not be due until May 1st, and those who have intimated their willingness
to become members will be informed before that date if the number of subscribers
promised does not justify the committee in issuing the publication.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY</h3>

<p>The Annual Report of the Bibliographical Society announces that the Society's
<i>Transactions</i> will henceforth be published in quarterly parts, and that with a view to
lessening the cost it is proposed to allow copies to be purchased by non-members and
to accept advertisements. It is hoped also that <i>The Library</i>, founded by Sir John
MacAlister in 1888 and edited during recent years by Mr. A. W. Pollard, the Keeper
of Printed Books at the British Museum, and the Honorary Secretary of the Bibliographical
Society, may be brought into the scheme, and that the quarterly numbers
may be gradually worked up into a full bibliographical magazine.</p>

<p>At the December meeting of the Society a point of great bibliographical interest was
raised by a paper read by Mr. F. W. Bourdillon on "Some French Romances." He
showed how many of the woodcuts used in illustration were reproduced by one printer
after another with a marked fall in quality by a method of transfer on to wood-blocks
called by the technical name of <i>pocher</i>, which, he submitted, may be an ancestor of the
modern English verb "to poach." Mr. Bourdillon urged the importance of the comparative
study of such woodcuts, and suggested that a Society should be formed for
reproducing early book illustrations in facsimile.</p>

<h3 class="left"><i>DISCOVERY</i></h3>

<p>A Conference was called last January by the joint invitation of the President of the
Royal Society, the President of the British Academy, and a large number of others,
interested both in the production and distribution of knowledge, to frame, if possible,
a scheme for a journal which should present in popular form the most recent results
of research in all the chief subjects of knowledge. This Conference appointed a committee
to frame a scheme, and their report was presented and adopted at the adjourned
meeting of the Conference held recently in the rooms of the Royal Society, Burlington
House. Professor R. S. Conway, of Manchester, has acted throughout as Secretary
of the movement. The meeting approved the name <i>Discovery</i> for the new journal, and
established a trust for its maintenance, the first trustees being Sir Joseph J. Thomson,
O.M., P.R.S., Sir Frederic G. Kenyon, D.Litt., K.C.B., P.B.A., Professor A. C.
Seward, Sc.D., F.R.S., Professor R. S. Conway, Litt.D., P.B.A.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
The meeting further approved of the agreement made provisionally by the Executive
Committee, with Mr. John Murray as Publisher, and of his and the committee's joint
recommendation of Captain A. S. Russell, M.C., D.Sc., recently of the R.G.A., now
of the University, Sheffield, and Reader-elect in Chemistry at Christ Church, Oxford,
as Editor. The first number will be issued on January 15th, 1920, at the price of sixpence.</p>

<p>The Conference further considered in detail and adopted the committee's scheme
for the management of the journal, of which the chief principles may be mentioned.
The control of the trustees is final, but they undertake to exercise it through a managing
committee, which they will appoint on the nomination of a large number of bodies, the
chief of whom are the Conjoint Board of Scientific Societies, who will nominate five
members, the Classical, Historical, English, and Geographical, each of whom will
nominate one member, and the Modern Language Association, if, as is hoped, that also
adheres to the scheme. Further the British Psychological Society and the Royal Society
of Economics will appoint one member.</p>

<p>This, however, is only one side of the committee's constitution. It will comprise also
representatives of the great Associations which represent different bodies of students
and teachers, and the public libraries. Those that have already pledged themselves
to take part are the National Union of Teachers, which is to nominate two representatives;
the Co-operative Union; the Associations of Headmasters and Headmistresses,
who will appoint one member. Similar co-operation is hoped for from the Royal Society
of Literature, the Library Association, the Young Men's Christian Association, the
Workers' Educational Association, the Associations of Assistant Masters and Assistant
Mistresses, and the Association of Education Committees, all of which have expressed
sympathy with the movement.</p>

<h2 class="b0">DRAMA</h2>

<h3 class="p1 b1">THE DUCHESS OF MALFI</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> production by the Phœnix Society of Webster's <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> at
the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith, gave many people an opportunity to make
an exhibition of themselves. In the first place, it was somewhat astonishing
to find that on the Sunday night the audience, which one might have
supposed to have been made up of people of some education, contained
many persons who were evidently unaware that Webster wrote at the very
beginning of the seventeenth century, and who had gone to the Lyric Theatre
expecting to find a classical and not a renaissance tragedy. Perhaps this is
being too kind to them; perhaps they thought <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> was a
Revue, or a Viennese Musical Comedy by Leo Fall or Franz Lehar, which, owing
to D.O.R.A., could not yet be produced on the ordinary stage. But perhaps they
did not even think at all, and their tittering and nudging was merely the manifestation
of the vacancy of their minds. Whatever the explanation, it is certainly odd that such
people should be&mdash;as they presumably were&mdash;members of the Phœnix Society. It has
been said to me that this section of the audience was composed largely of the profession,
to whom Sunday night is their one opportunity of the week to enjoy the role of spectator.
I hesitate to believe it. I refuse to believe it, although the notorious and shameful
ignorance of many actors and actresses of the dramatic literature of their own country
is difficult to forget. But if this is the explanation&mdash;and it is an unpalatable one&mdash;it also
accounts for the reception given&mdash;again by a section only of the audience&mdash;to Mr.
Farquharson's extraordinarily fine effort to grapple with the part of Ferdinand. The rank
and file of actors, like the rank and file of musicians, are notoriously poor judges of
their own art. They are sound enough when it is a question of merely conventional
skill. They know in an ordinary way the difference between the professional and the
amateur. Mere clumsiness, roughness, or smoothness of technique they can discern and,
to some extent, understand; but even in these matters it is the conventional, the accustomed
way of doing a thing rather than the essentially good way of doing it that they
judge by. The moment an actor goes outside routine methods he runs the risk of being
ridiculed; his slightest faults and exaggerations and mistakes are fastened upon, while
what there may be of insight, imagination, and power in his characterisation is completely
passed over.</p>

<p>This is what happened to Mr. Robert Farquharson at <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>. He gave
an interpretation of the character of Ferdinand which was a real creative effort of the
actor's imagination. Even if he had been less successful than he was in producing the
effect he aimed at, he should have met with a respectful attention from his fellow-artists
in the audience. But such an attention would have proceeded from an interest in
and some glimmer of an understanding of the serious efforts of an artist; whereas these
people who disgraced themselves by loudly giggling at Mr. Farquharson were not
obviously blind to serious art.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Farquharson's interpretation I will say this. It was essentially sound and
convincing. In portraying Ferdinand as a man abnormal, fanatical, and almost insane
on the subject of sex, we are made to understand all his subsequent conduct. Ferdinand,
as drawn by Webster, is a man of diseased imagination; he is described in the very first
scene by Antonio as "a most perverse and turbulent nature"; his very language right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
from the start is more violent, more imaginative than that of any other character in the
play. Sex is an obsession with him; his first words to his sister are:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">You are a widow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know already what man is;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">And his second:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Marry! they are most luxurious<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will wed twice. Their lovers are more spotted<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than Laban's sheep.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">He cannot let the subject alone, he is always returning to it. Earlier in the scene, when he
tells Bosola that he does not wish his sister to marry again, he says:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Do not you ask the reason, but be satisfied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I say I would not.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Farquharson said these words with just the right emphasis, an emphasis that sent
a shudder through one's flesh, it was so simple, so vague, and yet so peculiar.</p>

<p>Now, for this Mr. Farquharson ought to have been highly praised. It meant, first
of all, that Mr. Farquharson had an original conception of his part; and, secondly, that
he had the technique to carry his conception across the footlights. But imagination must
meet imagination; if it meets nothing but dullness it might just as well be dull itself, its
effect is necessarily <i>nil</i>; and, apparently, that is what Mr. Farquharson's noble effort
did meet. It was really astonishing to find written in the daily Press the pained little
grumblings of men who had been unable to discover an adequate motive for Ferdinand's
conduct, and who expressed their dissatisfaction with Webster's capacity as a dramatist,
after having been accustomed for many years to the dramatic genius of Mr. Walter Ellis
(the author of <i>A Little Bit of Fluff</i>), Mr. George R. Sims (the author of <i>The Great Day</i>),
Mr. Oscar Asche (author of <i>Chu Chin Chow</i>), Mr. Robert Hichens (author of <i>The Voice
from the Minaret</i>), and many others of equal greatness but too numerous to mention.
It was perhaps an over-familiarity with the works of this galaxy of genius that led one
London newspaper to describe <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> in headlines as "Funnier than
Farce." The atmosphere of a genuine tragedy might easily appear "funny" to anyone
accustomed to that of the average London play. One great difficulty that confronted
some critics was the impossibility&mdash;after a war in which millions were slaughtered&mdash;of
imagining the murder of four men. Because Webster's tragedy ends in the death of
four of the principal characters, it is, apparently, farcical or funny. It never even seems
to have occurred to these detractors of a great work that in Italy of the Renaissance&mdash;the
place and period with which Webster is dealing&mdash;such incidents were as common as
divorce suits nowadays; but it would, assuredly, be asking too much to expect people
to exercise a little historical imagination who have no imagination of any sort, and
who are, therefore, to be pitied for their inability to understand any play that does not
contain a telephone.</p>

<p>On the bulk of the audience, however, Mr. Farquharson's Ferdinand made a deep
impression, and the wonderful fifth scene in the second act, where Ferdinand enters
with the words: "I have this night digged up a mandrake," was very nearly one of the
finest and most blood-curdling things I have ever witnessed. It was just marred by a few
exaggerations of gesture and crudities which could have easily been put right, but in
conception and power it was magnificent. I have used the word "blood-curdling,"
although I know that nobody's blood curdles nowadays, least of all the blood of
dramatic critics. But that is just what is wrong with them. It is no distinction to have
blood that does not "curdle." The blood of an ox does not curdle&mdash;not at the tragedy
of <i>King Lear</i>, nor <i>Macbeth</i>, nor the third act of <i>Die Walküre</i>, nor the <i>Prometheus</i> of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
Scriabin. There must be an imagination in the spectator to take fire, and without
imagination the work of a poet like Webster must of necessity appear incomprehensible:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Methinks I see her laughing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Excellent hyena! Talk to me somewhat quickly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or my imagination will carry me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see her in the shameful act of sin.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">To the unimaginative these lines of Ferdinand's will seem nothing, but they are
wonderful in their dramatic vividness and appropriateness. I have quoted them because
it is the sort of writing Webster gives us on every page; it is not one of his purple patches.
Webster's command of language is little short of marvellous. To anyone with a sense of
words it is a wonderful experience to read <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> for the first time; and
after seeing it played one returns to the book and finds it all ten times more wonderful
still. Could anything be more utter cant than the suggestion that the plays of many
modern dramatists are superior to Webster's even as literature? How many of them
can be read at all, even once? It is so nearly impossible that more than half of them
cannot be published, and of those that are published the perusal of a few pages leads to
their prompt consignment to the dustbin. As for ever attaining that combination of
great poetry with perfect dramatic appropriateness culminating in moments when
<i>vox in faucibus hæsit</i>, it is utterly beyond them. Such passages as:</p>

<p>Such passages are as abundant in Webster as dots in the novels of Mr. H. G. Wells.
The only readable modern English dramatist&mdash;with the exception of Mr. Granville
Barker, and possibly of Sir James Barrie&mdash;is Mr. Shaw; but one reads Mr. Shaw for his
wit, and his wit, like water-ices, is, though tasty, very poor sustenance. Yet the same
people who treat <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> as "Farce" take Mr. Shaw's amusing buffoonery
quite seriously; and there is one explanation for both phenomena, and it is the one with
which I began&mdash;lack of imagination. An imaginative man does not need Mr. Shaw to
show him in a play that soldiers value their lives, and there being nothing astoundingly
novel in the idea, he is free to appreciate Mr. Shaw's extravagant humour; but the
unimaginative man thinks, firstly, that it is some perilous and subversive doctrine, or
some new and wonderful truth&mdash;according to his political prejudice&mdash;and then, secondly,
when some personal experience fits Mr. Shaw's formula, looks upon Mr. Shaw as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
dealer in real property, and has for him that serious consideration he has for his landlord.
This explains the fate of such a brilliant piece of extravaganza as <i>Arms and the
Man</i>, which Mr. Loraine has produced at the Duke of York's Theatre. Originally
the darling of unimaginative intellectuals&mdash;to whom it had brought light&mdash;and the
bugbear of equally unimaginative Philistines&mdash;to whom its "light" was the flame of
revolution&mdash;it is now accepted by the ordinary man in the pit as an ordinary, matter-of-fact
account of what war is, because the man in the pit is just back from one and recognises
the likeness. The deafening applause from ex-soldiers at the Duke of York's
Theatre is something to go and hear. To them Mr. Shaw is no intellectual forerunner
opening up obscure paths of thought, but a man who has described exactly what used
to go on in the only army they have ever known, and they have for him the serious
respect they have for all retailers of materials. He is a dealer not in "fancies," but in
real goods. But this "reality" is just as imaginary as the former "light." Neither
Bluntschli nor Cyrano de Bergerac represents the soldier. There is, in fact, no such thing
as a soldier, there are only soldiers. The intellectual has never had his "light" nor the
plain man his "reality"; for, being without imagination, they cannot have these things.
There is no way of truth reaching an unimaginative man; he is doomed to live under a
series of illusions, only shedding one to receive another, but, by a sublime paradox, the
only illusion he can never shed is the illusion that poetry is an illusion, an illusion of
the senses. It is the fate of poetry, of such magnificent poetic drama as Webster's, to
remain always undraped in the world of imagination and never by any protective
mimicry to take the colour of its surroundings and put on a fashionable dress. This,
its unique greatness, is in the eyes of the unimaginative man its weakness, because he fails
to recognise in it any of the outward appearances of his daily life&mdash;in short, he fails to
see his washerwoman because to him she is a washerwoman and not a woman.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to think that there are actors and actresses who practically, for sheer
love of their art, will give their time and ability for two isolated performances of a long
and difficult work like <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i>. The performance, as a whole, was remarkably
good, and it seems to me worth while recording the cast here:</p>

Of Mr. Farquharson I have already spoken. Equally fine but smoother and more
accomplished was the work of Miss Cathleen Nesbitt as the Duchess. Mr. William J.
Rea gave a fine and convincing study of Bosola, whose "garb of melancholy" he wore
with an exquisite naturalness. Mr. Rea has a beautiful voice, and I hope it gave him
as much pleasure to speak Webster's wonderful verse as it gave me to hear it so beautifully
spoken. Antonio is difficult to make attractive, but Mr. Nicholas Hannen might
have been more successful. I thought Miss Edith Evans's Julia excellent, but the
Cardinal might well have been more sinister; he has some splendid lines to speak,
including the famous:</p>

<h2>THE FINE ARTS</h2>

<h3 class="left">British Comic Drawing</h3>

<p class="drop-cap1"><span class="smcap1">I</span> have before me the Christmas Number of <i>Punch</i>. After a conscientious perusal of
its illustrated pages, I was led to think seriously about comic drawings. <i>Punch</i> has
probably the largest circulation of comic papers, its position is undeniably established,
it is, in fact, an institution in much the same way as the British Museum: we
are accustomed to it, it exacts its quota of mirth from hundreds of thousands of
people each week. It always contains some amusing things, but it is a pity that its drawings
are not funnier. As comic drawings, most of them are quite valueless; they are not comic
drawings but drawings of persons correctly portrayed in more or less amusing situations,
the whole greatly helped by the wording beneath. Even the faces joined to the carefully-rendered
bodies, with their carefully-drawn clothes (texture is felt here) and surroundings,
are presented with the correct lines and expressions which a professor of physiognomy
would connect with the various human emotions. The artist's personality behind
these productions is rarely felt except as a stumbling-block to any progress of the absurd
or whimsical. Mr. Max Beerbohm sums the matter up in his preface to a recent book
of nonsense: "That a comic drawing should itself be comic seems to be a reasonable
demand. Yet it is a demand which few comic draughtsmen meet. Comic drawings for
the most part are but comic ideas seriously illustrated. We are shown an angry man
who has just raised his stroke at golf; near him a caddie grinning behind his hand;
and a view of the golf-links. Admirable! The man's stockings and knickerbockers, his
cap, his collar, and tie are so rendered that a hosier would not blush to sign them. The
drawing of the caddie's fingers would satisfy any drawing-master in any municipal
art school. The treatment of the golf-links is faithful, sensitive, reverent. But&mdash;where
does the fun come in? Through the text beneath maybe. But only for a moment. Out
it goes, arrested, in the grip of the artist's firm and laborious hand."</p>

<p>Quite recently a friend of mine, whose drawings were more remarkable for their
absurdity than for their strict draughtsmanship, attempted to obtain some work at the
offices of one of our latest and most frivolous papers. The following conversation
matured between him and the art editor:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Art Editor</span>: These drawings are too queer for us, they won't go down over here.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Artist</span>: How do you mean won't go down?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Art Editor</span>: People don't understand them. They might do for France, but (mind
you) they'd be queer even there.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Artist</span>: Ah!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Art Editor</span>: Now frankly (I hope you don't mind my being frank?)&mdash;(<span class="smcap">Artist</span>: Not at
all.)&mdash;You wouldn't say you could draw, would you?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Artist</span>: I should not dare to be so presumptuous.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Art Editor</span>: Well, these are the sort of drawings that children do in the suburbs of
an evening.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Artist</span>: Indeed!</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Art Editor</span>: Now, see here, in this drawing&mdash;you've only put three fingers on one
hand. People notice that, you know. Now, if you could do us something
like this (producing a third-rate imitation of Bateman figuring some gentleman
of a pronounced Semitic type) we might be able to find you a job.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Artist</span>: Well, I think I won't swell the ranks of people who are doing drawings of
this kind.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Art Editor</span> (surprised and suspicious): Ah, I'm sorry, I fear the drawings are no use
to us, but I hope you don't mind my giving my opinion?</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Artist</span>: No, no, not at all. I shall value it. And now, please, how do I get out of this
building?</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Among the hosts of illustrators working for the comic papers there are very few comic
artists and more artists than comedians. <i>Punch</i> would do well to relieve the monotony
of its pages more often with the drawings of Mr. Bateman. There is a strength and
subtlety in Mr. Bateman's line which places him far above other illustrators of this
nature, while his knowledge and portrayal of types with the utmost economy of means
is very stimulating: but then he can afford to be realistic also because he is above all a
humorist. He possesses the faculty for letting himself go. Mr. George Morrow pleases us
frequently by his gentle humour, and Mr. Haselden, a remarkable man, sustains our
daily interest in the <i>Daily Mirror</i>. Mr. Heath Robinson is a master of whimsical invention,
but I am not certain if he is not a very skilful engineer and mechanician in disguise&mdash;but
certainly ingeniously disguised. Of the too regular contributors to <i>Punch</i> very
little need be said, and of the illustrators of the cheaper comic publications still less:
the best one can say of some of them is that they reproduce drawings from Continental
papers. Between the extremes of academic respectability on the one hand and feeble
vulgarity on the other there would seem to be no middle course. Our humorous
papers are far below the level of such papers as the German <i>Jugend</i> or <i>Simplicissimus</i>,
or the French <i>Le Rire</i>. One feels that their draughtsmanship is more simple and effective
and their humour more spontaneous. This is not a plea for mere savagery of caricature,
which appears foreign to our national temperament. But what a relief it would be if
one fine week <i>Punch</i> went quite mad and appeared with its print upside down, or, better
still, no print at all, and if all the artists gave free rein to whatever absurdity possessed
them that week!</p>

<h3 class="left">M. Henri Matisse</h3>

<p>I suppose it is natural that the landscapes of M. Matisse should have a stronger
appeal to me than his other works in the Leicester Galleries. Yet, apart from any purely
egotistical considerations, I think many people will agree that his landscapes play a
very important, if not the most important, part in the success of his exhibition. In many
of them there seems to be no striving for the accomplishment of a unique or startling
design, but there is a depth of feeling in their form and a mystery in their colour that
alone accounts sufficiently for Matisse's reputation in modern art. I am extremely
covetous of any one or all of these pictures. Matisse, in his landscapes, is a poet as well
as a painter: his intense feeling for the quiet and rather awe-inspiring moments in
Nature, his rendering of the vague profusion of growth, the cool grey horizontal clouds
and subtle effects of light, make him a master in this branch of his art. I do not find this
intensity of feeling in his other works, they are apt to cool one's ardour after the landscapes,
and we are brought to think of design <i>per se</i>, and confronted with a flatness of
handling that is not nearly so intriguing. His largest painting, <i>Portrait de Femmes</i> (<i>trois
sœurs</i>), is very noble, and the drawings should not fail to satisfy the diminishing (I hope)
body of people who <i>will</i> sniff at such an exhibition and utter those well-worn and
unpardonable remarks on lack of draughtsmanship. Messrs. Brown and Phillips are
to be congratulated on procuring for us such an interesting exhibition, and for giving
us in the catalogue a photograph of M. Matisse. A glance at this likeness might still the
outcries of Philistia more effectually than much argument.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">Goupil Gallery Salon</h3>

<p>Mr. William Marchant's salons, discontinued during the war, have come to life again,
and the ninth of the series has been open during November and December. The Goupil
Gallery has a large capacity, and Mr. Marchant seems to have gone out into all parts
of the United Kingdom and gathered in a large crowd of artists, nor has he been able
entirely to exclude some of the halt and the blind. A detailed criticism from picture to
picture, or even from one man's group of work to another's, would be very tedious, for
there are some 300 exhibits displayed in the series of rooms. The choice of work is very
comprehensive, ranging from James Pryde to Pamela Bianco, from Mr. Lewis's portrait
of Mr. Pound to the post-Millais backwash of Mr. Ranken.</p>

<p>In the Large Gallery are Mr. Augustus John and Mr. Sickert. The former
exhibits two soldier portraits and No. 51, <i>Birdie</i>, all of which serve to remind us of his
unequalled position in that branch of art. Mr. Sickert, the contemporary in age with
most of the artists in this room, shines forth in his work with all the vigour and freshness
of youth. His No. 49, <i>Bridge at Bath</i>, challenges the declining interest in the work of
the more established artists in the room, while he runs level with, even sets the pace for,
the younger generation.</p>

<p>In the First Gallery Mr. Lewis's portrait of Mr. Ezra Pound is apt to blunt our sensibilities
to the other works therein. It is indeed a remarkable painting, standing like a
ferro-concrete factory amidst a peaceful and rather decaying village. Of its faithfulness
I am unable to judge, being acquainted with Mr. Pound solely in the pages of the <i>Little
Review</i>, but its hard compelling colour and the solidity of its built-up design make it a
thing difficult to forget. Mr. Robert Bevan's landscape, No. 100, has a reposeful design
that is very telling. Mr. Ginner's sturdy realism is refreshing, and his painting in this
room is, I think, more successful in design and colour than his other exhibit.</p>

<p>The Third Gallery.&mdash;Here, again, Mr. Sickert's two charming paintings attract our
attention, and Mr. Mark Gertler's fine portrait is essentially a picture that leaves an
impression in this maze of paintings. There are besides two fine wall paintings by
Mr. William Rothenstein.</p>

<p>The Grey Room deserves its name indeed. It is difficult to say why the standard of
water-colours is so low compared to the oils: with a very few exceptions, noticeably the
drawings of Mr. Albert Rutherston, we seem to have touched bottom in this room,
and a very muddy bottom too, so that coming at last to Mr. Shackleton's <i>Peace Day</i>
one felt there remained nothing but to burst through the skylight into the air again.
The absence of line in the water-colour drawings is very depressing.</p>

<h3>ARTISTIC PERIODICALS</h3>

<h4 class="left"><i>ILLUSTRATION</i></h4>

<p>Foremost among the periodicals issued recently is Mr. Gerard Meynell's <i>Illustration</i>.
This is a trade circular, and as such would naturally demonstrate within its covers the
printer's aspirations in the reproduction of blocks and lettering. "Circular" is not an
attractive word, but Mr. Meynell is no ordinary printer, and his circular is still less an
ordinary affair. To those who are unacquainted with it, I would hasten to say that
<i>Illustration</i> is more like a beautifully-coloured fairy-tale book than the accepted idea of
a circular. This time Mr. Meynell has surpassed himself in his efforts not merely in the
turn-out of his book, which to the professional and the amateur glance must be entirely
admirable, but in giving us the added interest of a Supplement containing eight reproductions
of modern art.</p>

<h2>MUSIC</h2>

<h3>COVENT GARDEN</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">ONE</span> success at least Covent Garden has achieved&mdash;<i>Parsifal</i>. It fills the house,
and it deserves to do so, for it is by far the best performance that has been
seen this season. The scenery and costumes, as far as could be seen from the
topmost proscenium box, in which the <span class="smcap">London Mercury</span> was accommodated,
were those of the original Covent Garden production. The Temple of
the Grail was dignified and beautiful, the magic flower-garden ridiculous. The flower-maidens,
who sang extremely well and were in themselves quite competent to look
their parts, wore dresses that might have been discarded by a travelling Gilbert-and-Sullivan
company, half from <i>Iolanthe</i> and half from <i>The Mikado</i>. The swan was as
ridiculous as ever. That worst trap of all for producers of <i>Parsifal</i>, the undressing and
washing of the hero in the first scene of the third act, was painfully successful. It was a
toss-up whether Kundry would not remove Parsifal's wig along with his helmet, and
the struggles of the holy knight to pull his white draperies down from under his armour
were comic in the extreme. There are many little hitches and absurdities in all operas
which pass unnoticed, because something of greater importance happens at the same
moment and distracts the attention. But these particular episodes are in themselves
the most important things happening at their particular moments. It is on them that all
attention must be concentrated by the audience, and if they are made ludicrous by
careless handling the solemnity of the drama is very gravely impaired. It is not as if
they depended upon elaborate machinery. What is required is forethought and common
sense.</p>

<p>Miss Gladys Ancrum's Kundry was a very notable achievement. Her gestures would
be the better for a little more restraint and a good deal more sense of definite design.
Her singing was full of colour, and she showed great dramatic power in the use of
different qualities of tone. It is a part which covers a very wide range of character-drawing;
there are at least four distinct personalities in Kundry, and Miss Ancrum
went a very considerable way towards distinguishing them and endowing them with
life. Parsifal is one of the most ungrateful parts ever given to a hero. Pure fools may be
quite attractive people in ordinary life, but on the operatic stage, especially when tenors,
there is little to be done with them. Van Dyck, who was reputed the greatest of Parsifals,
was corpulent, and sang out of tune. Mr. Walter Hyde did not look very boyish, but
he at least sang well. Mr. Langley's melodramatic manner was well suited to the part
of Klingsor. As Gurnemanz Mr. Norman Allin showed a fine voice and a dignified
presence; but of all Wagnerian bores Gurnemanz is the most boring, surpassing even
Wolfram in tediousness, and it is only a very ripe actor, with that quality of vocal style
which may be called either unction or unctuousness according to taste, who can make
the part really effective on the stage. The most sympathetic character in <i>Parsifal</i> is
Amfortas, and Mr. Percy Heming being one of the most sympathetic actors and singers
in the company, it was very poignantly realised.</p>

<p>When we read of a new opera by Mr. Delius, <i>Fennimore and Gerda</i>, having been
produced recently at Frankfurt with great success, it was indeed a bitter disappointment
that Covent Garden could not even resuscitate <i>A Village Romeo and Juliet</i>. The
Beecham Company performed it in a previous season, so it cannot have presented all
the difficulties of a new creation. It may well have been better to withdraw it altogether
than to give it badly; but if more time was wanted for rehearsal it might well have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
the place of <i>Nail</i>, which reflects more credit on Sir Thomas Beecham's good nature
than on his artistic judgment.</p>

<p>Moussorgsky's <i>Khovantchina</i> had an indifferent performance and an indifferent
house. It is less popular than <i>Boris Godunov</i>, and less obviously dramatic, but it has
more unity of purpose and contains much better music. Both operas, however, are
invariably so much cut about that the difficulty of following the story is very much
increased. Mr. Norman Allin had a magnificent opportunity in the part of Dositheus,
but it is not sufficient to treat it as if Dositheus were one of the conventional operatic
ministers of religion. It was one of Chaliapin's most overwhelming creations; but Mr.
Allin, though undoubtedly a fine singer, has far to go before he can achieve the ease
and perfection of Chaliapin's vocalisation. Our singers do not concentrate nearly enough
attention on the pure art of singing. They may be divided roughly into two categories:
the clever ones who think that the psychological understanding of a character and the
vigorous declamation of words are enough to carry them through any part, and the
stupid ones who think that fine singing consists in imitating the external mannerisms
of Caruso or any other Milanese or Neapolitan star. The clever ones are quite right in
realising that English singing can never be achieved by trying to make a bad copy of
Italian tricks. Many of these tricks do not indeed belong to the fine art of singing at all;
they are merely appeals to false emotion, which excite a vulgar Italian audience just
as the well-worn ballad-concert mannerisms excite a vulgar audience in England. A
training in the real Italian style is without doubt of the greatest possible value to an
English singer, provided that it means a thorough training in Italian literature and
conversation, for that involves a study of speech-rhythms and a purity of articulation,
which are invaluable to any one who makes use of his voice either as a singer or as a
speaker. Pure singing and pure speaking are essential requirements to any operatic
artist, and the singer must grasp the principle that his vocal technique is to be the
servant of his artistic idea and not a hindrance to its sincere expression.</p>

<p>For Bizet's <i>Djamileh</i> Sir Thomas Beecham would no doubt have deserved sincere
gratitude had it not been postponed until too late for inclusion in this notice. There
was much that was laughable in the <i>The Fair Maid of Perth</i>, but Bizet even at his lowest
has always charm and, what is more important, unexpected turns of originality.</p>

<p>There are historical reasons for thinking that the lighter forms of opera are those
most suited to the English temperament in general. Attempts are constantly being made
to re-establish light opera of a really artistic kind in this country, and although no one
has yet succeeded in rivalling Sullivan in this field, Sir Thomas is certainly doing an
excellent work in perpetually holding up Mozart and Bizet as working models for both
the English composer and the English public to study and to enjoy.</p>

<h3>CONCERTS</h3>

<p>When Busoni next visits this country it is to be hoped that he will have better opportunities
of being heard under appropriate conditions. The crowded and enthusiastic
audiences which filled the Wigmore Hall for his two recitals showed that he might
well have given half-a-dozen similar programmes instead of appearing as star turn at
the Albert Hall on Sunday afternoons, and there is not the slightest doubt that the
Wigmore Hall audiences were of the kind that he could play to with real pleasure. He
appeared at one of the Queen's Hall Symphony Concerts as composer and conductor,
and also played Mozart's Concerto in C minor. Here, too, it was impossible to separate
Busoni the pianist from Busoni the composer, for the concerto was embellished by
cadenzas of singular originality and loveliness. Those inserted in the slow movement
were startlingly modern, but with a modernity that Mozart himself might well have
achieved if he had lived to the age of his interpreter, for they were certainly designed on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
thoroughly Mozartian principles of composition. Two fragments from a <i>Faust</i> opera, on
which Busoni is now engaged, gave the highest hopes of the complete work, for they
were most noble and impressive musical pictures. At his farewell recital on December 6th
he played Liszt's Sonata in B minor with a breadth and dignity that placed Liszt
almost on a level with Beethoven. As a player of Chopin, Busoni has always been somewhat
hard to accept; but the mellowing of style which the last five years have brought
him was very apparent in his treatment of the Five Ballades, and still more in the
Nocturne in C minor, which of all the Nocturnes is the most suited to Busoni's very
monumental interpretation.</p>

<p>Of singers by far the most interesting has been Mme. Jane Bathori, who appeared at
one of the Classical Concert Society's concerts. She has long been known as the finest
exponent of modern French songs. She is also an excellent pianist, and often plays her
own accompaniments, thus securing a perfect homogeneity of performance, which the
best pair of partners can hardly ever realise.</p>

<p>The Royal Philharmonic Society, after passing through some trying moments during
the war, has made energetic efforts to regain its ancient honourable traditions. With
Mr. Coates, Mr. Geoffrey Toye, Mr. Adrian Boult, and Mr. Landon Ronald as conductors,
it is quite clear that London has no scarcity of orchestral directors. A new
departure has been made by the establishment of the Philharmonic Choir, under the
management of Mr. Charles Kennedy Scott, the conductor of the Oriana Madrigal
Society. The programmes of the concerts exhibit a judicious selection of classic and
modern works, among which English music is prominent. The general verdict on the
first two concerts was that some of the pieces chosen, both old and new, were not of
first-rate importance. The compilers of the programmes were probably quite well aware
of that fact. There are, in fact, plenty of works, such as Holbrooke's <i>Ulalume</i> and
Meyerbeer's <i>Struensee</i> Overture, to name two examples only, which certainly are not
immortal masterpieces, but are none the less quite interesting and well worth an occasional
hearing. Even acknowledged masterpieces have been known to suffer from too
frequent performance.</p>

<p>A new Italian composer, Francesco Malipiero, has been very prominent in recent
programmes. M. Yves Tinayre sang his <i>Chanson Morave</i>, Mr. Mark Hambourg
played his <i>Barlumi</i> for pianoforte; of his orchestral music, <i>Impressioni dal Vero</i> was
heard at the Promenades, a <i>Ditirambo Tragico</i> at the Queen's Hall Symphony Concerts,
and, lastly, at the second Philharmonic, <i>Le Pause del Silenzio</i>. No explanation has been
offered of this curious title, but it may possibly bear some connection with an interesting
passage in D'Annunzio's novel, <i>Il Fuoco</i>, in which Stelio Effrena maintains that the
essence of music lies not in the sounds but in the silences that separate them. It is something
of a compliment to Malipiero that his last work succeeded in rousing a Philharmonic
audience to hostility. Such demonstrations are rare in this country, though their rarity
is due less to broadminded receptivity than to courteous indifference. Malipiero will
survive his hisses. His language is harsh and obscure, although a study of his scores
shows that he has plenty of technical skill, for he is evidently dealing with emotions
which he has not yet been able to express clearly, and which we have probably not been
accustomed to hear expressed. Judging from the scores, it seemed that the performances,
both under Mr. Toye at the Philharmonic and under Sir Henry Wood, were lacking in
the singing sense. There is a temptation in these days to lay too much stress upon the
strangeness of strange harmonies. They would become clearer if more attention was
given to the elucidation and intensification of the strange melodies which are at the
foundation of all modern music that is likely to last. There can be no doubt about the
sincerity and depth of feeling in Malipiero's music, though it has not the more attractive
qualities of Casella's facile ingenuity.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDITORIAL NOTES</h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">AN</span> interesting exchange of opinions about modern art took place
in the <i>Times</i> last month. The art-critic stated that modern
English artists were afraid of ugliness; Sir Sidney Colvin replied
that so far was this from being the truth "that the prevalent
malady of the time, at least among those artists and critics who arrogate
to themselves the title of 'modern,' was a much less becoming form of
cowardice&mdash;namely, the fear of beauty. Because the beauty-blind may be
taken in by prettiness, and because a new fashion in critical theory has
come over from France (to perish, as I have seen dozens of such theories
perish in their day), nothing, in the circles to which I refer, is attempted or
applauded which either bears any resemblance to nature or records any
predilection of the mind except for what is shrieking and dissonant in colour
and jumbled and jarring, like a kind of insane geometry, in form. Of all
things such 'modernity' is doubtless doomed soonest to be ancient, or
not to give it so honourable a name, at least obsolete, discarded, and unregretted."</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>That there are many English artists who are in a sense afraid of ugliness,
in other words, who will only make pretty imitations of things recognised
as beautiful, is not to be denied: it might almost be said that artists may be
divided into those who have an unreasonable fear of ugliness and those who
have a reprehensible love of it. Many difficult questions are involved in
such a discussion: often two disputing parties will be found to be fundamentally
in agreement. The <i>Times</i> critic was emphasising the truth that
unoriginality is bad; Sir Sidney Colvin the equal truth that bogus originality is
bad. But his remarks reminded us of a great many observations we have all
recently heard with respect to certain tendencies to be observed in contemporary
art or pseudo-art. The elderly and many of the soberer young are alarmed
at much that they see painted or published. What does it all mean? they ask.
Are the world's artists rushing over a steep place into the sea? Is there some
new revelation in what looks at first sight like obscure rubbish? Are these
noisy rioters really the young? Do they really hate everything that has ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
been considered true? Will the whole of the coming generation be captured
by them? Mingled with the dislike there is a great deal of bewilderment.
Men doubt themselves. After all, new artistic developments have often been
incomprehensible; these things are undeniably incomprehensible, so perhaps
they are new artistic developments. Those who are tired of strife shiver,
wrap their coats around them, prepare to retire into corners where the cold
blast cannot reach them. But we really do not think that they should be so
depressed, or that more vigorous men like Sir Sidney Colvin should be so
alarmed: a rational diagnosis of the situation dissipates these apparent
dangers.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Now we had better begin by premising that in the sphere of the fine arts
we are not (these things are never taken for granted) denying the value of
modern developments and the possibility of later ones. Not all the technical
experiments of modern intellectual artists (akin to experiments in new
media) may be fruitful, but at the centre of most movements, however extravagant,
may be found an original artist who has either a peculiar way of
looking at the world (El Greco is an example) or desires to experiment with
some method in order to find out what results may accrue from it. But it is
not a good thing to base a theory on the mannerisms of an original artist; it is
still worse to build a convention on his unsuccessful experiments; and worst
of all, perhaps, for an artist to paint not what he sees as he sees it through the
medium of his temperament, but what some philosophical critic, with a
distaste for both Nature and humanity, tells him to paint. A painter with
intelligence, however, will soon tire of something which produces results
which do not interest him; and the painting of foolish pictures by people
who desire merely to attract attention is to some extent limited because
anything that would deceive anybody involves a good deal of time and
trouble. The fine arts will look after themselves; few members of the
public will pay large sums for pictures that convey nothing to them. The
printed word is in a rather different category. The world is always full of
ineffective people who have a desire to write: a thing which can be done
at any moment by anyone who has pen, ink, and paper. They also desire to
attract attention by their writing. In our time "stunts" for their assistance
have been discovered which have never been hit upon before.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The various stunts with which we are now familiar have spread over the
whole world with a rapidity that no genuine spiritual movement or technical
discovery has ever equalled. Just before the war that vivacious Southerner,
Signor Marinetti, introduced us to the type-page, which consisted of capital
letters and notes of exclamation tumbled about in apparent confusion. The
first large English enterprise of the Futurist-Vorticist-Cubist kind was
(though it contained normal patches) the magenta magazine <i>Blast</i>. It succumbed
shortly after a hostile critic, consulting his Webster, had discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span>
the definition: "Blast:&mdash;a flatulent disease of sheep." But it died to give
place to countless smaller magazines and books containing bewildering
designs and extraordinary poems. The drawings and, to the eye which can
take in only their typography, the poems are indistinguishable from others
which are being published all over the world. The <i>blagueurs</i> attach themselves
to anything which will give them publicity. There is something
pathetic about the way in which, wherever the political Bolsheviks get into
office, they print the verses and cartoons of the artistic anarchists. They
don't understand them; all they know is that the bourgeois dislike them;
so in Munich last Easter, and (we daresay) in Moscow now, there is an
excellent opening for those who, for all anyone would be able to say to the
contrary, have only to scratch out the old titles of their interlocked triangles
and write underneath "Uprising of Proletariat," or some such thing. The
Vorticists and verslibrists exist from Spain to Sweden. We saw this month
a most beautifully produced volume from Tiflis. The words, scattered
about in the Paris-and-London style, were in Georgian and Russian; but no
translation was necessary; when one was supplied, the words and the
lack of sense were precisely what we expected. They might have been
Italian or English; and in the illustrations, mingled with the parallelograms,
could be seen fragments of wasp-waisted "nuts" in opera-hats and shirt
fronts, such as never were seen in Tiflis, where their heads are clad with
fur. In a recent number of the <i>Monthly Chapbook</i> Mr. Flint, giving specimens
of good and bad contemporary verse, quoted one gentleman who
begins a poem with:</p>

<div class="in4">
<pre>
éo    ié    iu    ié
é     é     ié    io    ié
ui    ui    io    iè
aéoé        iaoé.
</pre>
</div>

<p class="in0">And another poet who writes:</p>

<div class="in4">
<pre>
vrron&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;on&mdash;on
      vrrr     vrrr      vrrr
              hihihi.
</pre>
</div>

<p class="in0">It isn't really serious; but is any of this kind of thing serious? And is this
mere noise at bottom sillier than much of the free verse to which some
superficial meaning can be attached? We quote from an American review
which, as a whole, is sensible and good these lines from a poem called
<i>Autumn Night</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The moon is as complacent as a frog.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sits in the sky like a blind white stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And does not even see Love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she caresses his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her contemptuous light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She reaches her long white shivering fingers into the bowels of men.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She is Death enjoying Life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Innocently,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lasciviously.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Of that kind of thing, usually done with a little less force in the images, but
always meandering, stupid, and utterly unrhythmical, good American journals
have lately been full. It has ceased to be amusing; but we don't think that
anybody need be alarmed; nobody can like it, and in the end those who,
from restlessness or fear, have pretended to will revolt against a diet of
wind and sawdust and return to something more palatable.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>For the simple truth is that the trick of incomprehensibility is the best
trick that has ever been invented for the benefit of writers who, if they can
feel or think, do not know how to translate their thoughts and feelings into
the language of art. Twenty years ago the swarm of useless young writers
discoursed on common themes in common metres imitatively, after the
manner of Tennyson or of Swinburne or of Verlaine. If they favoured
dignity and nobility they wrote sonnets beginning:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Under the high invulnerable stars,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">or plays like Savonarola Brown's; if Nature was their theme we heard of</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The blackbird's descant from the bough.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The virtuous wrote of love in the manner of:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your brows are calm and virginal,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">warming to:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your mouth is red as red, red roses are.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The sham rake-hells festooned their hectic amours with references to purple
breasts, absinthe, Messalina, and Semiramis: the banality was plain to see.
But Signor Marinetti and his congeners&mdash;we had been gently acclimatised
to great obscurity by artists like Mallarmé&mdash;provided these poets with a
priceless gift. Let rhythm go, let sense go: put down in barbarous sequence
any incongruous images that come into your head: even, if you like, put down
sheer gibberish: if possible, deceive yourself, and you will deceive others.
Produce a work so opaque that it cannot be seen through. The innocents
will either wildly protest against these dangerous revolutionaries&mdash;a much
more pleasing rôle to find oneself in than that of harmless mediocrity&mdash;or
else they will knit their brows with the reflection "if this young man expresses
himself in thoughts too deep for me, why what a very, very, very deep young
man this deep young man must be." But we have noticed that most of
these dealers in chaos soon tire. Those who have something in them (and
any young man is liable to be infected by a current fashion) get through, none
the worse: those who have not flag and stop.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>In our second number we called attention, as many before us have called
attention, to the scandalous state of the American copyright laws whereunder
British authors have been put to immense inconvenience and loss,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
and which have resulted in the early books of almost every important British
author being, in America, beyond his control. Since we wrote the American
Senate has come to a decision which greatly ameliorates the conditions as
they affect books published here since the war. It has been clear that during
the war, owing to the delays of mails, it has often been impossible for English
publishers and authors to secure American copyright even where American
publication could easily be arranged for&mdash;copies for deposit could not be
got across sufficiently quickly, and the time-limit of thirty days from English
publication expired. Under the new decision&mdash;which is largely due to the
efforts of Major G. H. Putnam&mdash;protection is secured for all British books of
which the American copyright has been lost during the war. The Act has
been amended: friendly alien authors have been given American copyright
on works of which copyright lapsed during the war; the concession extends
to works issued within fifteen months after the war, whatever the end
of the war may be defined to be. During that fifteen months authors may
take steps to establish their copyright; after that period, as we understand
it, British authors and publishers will have a longer period (<i>i.e.</i>, four
months) than before in which to secure their rights, provided a complete
copy of the English edition has been deposited in the Copyright Office not
more than sixty days after publication. We suppose, though we await further
information, that the fact that a book, presumed non-copyright, has been
published in America during the war will not prevent its being copyrighted;
but if this be so what will happen to a pirated edition (assuming such to
exist) which was legally permissible before the new amendment?</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>An important step has been made in the development of the literary
relations of the two countries. But these are still far from perfect. It may
not be possible to make the domestic copyright laws of the two countries the
same, but it should not be impossible for each country to extend to the
books of the other a simultaneous and automatic copyright on publication.
American books should be automatically copyright here when they appear
in America; English books should be automatically copyrighted in America
when they appear here. There is room for discussion as to the length of
term of copyright to be granted to foreigners; but a basis for mutual agreement
would not be difficult to find. We trust that Major Putnam will not
flag in the good work, and that English authors will co-operate to the best
of their ability.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>We printed in our last number a letter from Mr. J. G. Fletcher disputing
a statement made by our American correspondent that Mr. Nicholas Vachel
Lindsay was the only "live" poet now writing in America, and questioning
the justice of the praise given to Mr. Lindsay. On the assumption that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
readers will be interested, we are publishing in this issue a work by Mr.
Lindsay which illustrates his recent manner. It is a poem which presents
some difficulties to English readers. It evokes memories of a Presidential
campaign long gone past, and some of Mr. Lindsay's political references
(not to speak of his presumably mythical animals) will puzzle people; even
those English people who vaguely remember who Mark Hanna was will
probably not have the ghost of a vision of Altgeld.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>A binding case for <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span> is being prepared, and will,
we hope, be ready when the first volume (of six numbers) is complete. It
would be a convenience if readers who are preserving their sets and will
desire the official binding (which we can promise will not be an offensive
one) would let us know in advance by postcard so that we may have some
basis for our first order of cases.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>For some time after publication we were obliged to refuse orders for
our first number. We have recovered a very few copies, and, as we
prefer that they should go to persons who are really anxious to obtain them
in order to complete sets, we offer them at 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> a copy. Applications will
be dealt with in the order in which they are received. No. 2 will shortly
follow suit.</p>

<h2>LITERARY INTELLIGENCE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">WE</span> congratulate Mr. Austin Dobson, whose birthday was the eighteenth of
last month, on arriving at the full age of eighty. He has lived, for the past
twenty years, since his retirement from the public service, so noiselessly
that an idle world, always attentive to sensation, has half-forgotten to
regard his presence. He has always preferred to stand a little out of the
limelight, being by nature unobtrusive, and more conversant with books than with
men. Such serene natures miss some of the rewards of their own age, but when they
possess the quality of Mr. Austin Dobson posterity gives them their revenge. No one
in our time has pursued the profession of literature with a more disinterested fervour
than he. Mr. Dobson has taken no part in controversy, he has been mixed up with no
sensational "movements"; his whole thought has been fixed on the study of past
times and on the perfecting of his own delicate and lapidary art. He was not precocious
in his development. When his earliest volume of poems, <i>Vignettes in Rhyme</i>, appeared
he had reached his thirty-fourth year. He did not venture upon prose until eleven
years later, when he published his memoir of <i>Thomas Bewick</i>. His latest volume, <i>A
Bookman's Budget</i>, of 1917, combined both arts in one.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The quality of Mr. Austin Dobson, both in verse and prose, is curiously out of
sympathy with the general tendency of literature to-day. In prose&mdash;though we admit
that his essays have had numerous and distinguished admirers, Mr. Balfour, if we
remember right, having once praised them above his poems in the House of Commons&mdash;in
prose he seems to us to sacrifice freedom of movement to an intensely meticulous
accuracy and to a desire to leave no fact unrecorded. But in verse Mr. Austin Dobson
is, in his own restricted field, unsurpassed. He carries on, through the second half of
the nineteenth century, the tradition of Prior and Anstey and Praed. It may be said
that his poems are metrical pastimes, but he lifts them to the dignity of poetry. His
happiest pieces are so polished, so delicate, and so felicitous that not a word in them
could be altered; they are, of their own kind, perfect, and perfection is not relative but
positive. So long as the English language survives there will be readers of <i>The Ballad
of Beau Brocade</i>. We wish Mr. Austin Dobson many more years, and we hope that he
will yet be encouraged to give us specimens of his graceful penmanship.</p>

<p>The writers of the obituary notices of Sir William Osler were strangely silent as to
the love of books which was one of his most marked characteristics, and this although
in <i>Who's Who?</i> he had put down "Bibliography" as his only "Recreation," and at
the time of his death had been President of the Bibliographical Society for seven years,
nearly three times as long as any of his predecessors. In the true spirit of humanism his
interest in bibliography was first aroused by the books relating to his own profession,
and widened out from this to a fine catholicity. Within a year of his coming to England
he delivered an address on Sir Thomas Browne's <i>Religio Medici</i> before the Physical
Society of Guy's Hospital (printed in <i>The Library</i> for January, 1906), and he was never
tired of singing the praise of Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i> as "a great medical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
treatise (the greatest ever written by a layman), orderly in arrangement, intensely serious
in purpose, and weighty beyond belief in authorities." The quotation comes from a
paper he read before the Bibliographical Society on <i>The Library of Robert Burton</i> in
November, 1909, in which he gave a summarised account of the 580 books of Burton's
preserved at the Bodleian and the 429 in the library at Christ Church. Unless we are
mistaken, the picking out of these books, and the grouping those at Christ Church
round a portrait of Burton, copied from the original in Brasenose College, was due
mainly to his initiative. He certainly took a keen interest in both libraries, was an enthusiastic
curator of the Bodleian, and a generous supporter of the admirable <i>Bodleian
Quarterly</i>, started by Mr. Falconer Madan. A paper he contributed to this on the
Bookworm, illustrated by an admirable coloured plate exhibiting it in all its stages, is
by far the best study of that elusive "worm" ever printed.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>After he became President of the Bibliographical Society he gave another stimulating
address on the medical books printed before the close of the year 1480, its object being
"to get an idea of the mental attitude of the profession of medicine from the character
of the books printed." He had then been working on this subject for some time, and
even amid the countless activities into which he threw himself during the war did not
wholly neglect it. The description of the books was practically finished some time ago;
whether the introduction, in which he aimed at clothing the bibliographical skeleton
with flesh and blood, had been written is not yet known. He had over forty medical
books of the fifteenth century in his own collection, and was forming a specialist library
to illustrate the history of science, and of medicine in particular, on a strikingly original
plan. Its completion should have been the occupation of a leisurely old age, but he loved
his fellows too well to give himself any leisure, and left this for others to complete.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>We welcome from America the first number of the new <i>Dial</i>. The <i>Dial</i> was founded at
Chicago in 1880 by Francis F. Browne. Until a few years ago it remained in the Browne
family, who produced fortnightly a paper, sober, academic, and informative, somewhat
resembling our <i>Athenæum</i> of Victorian days. A few years ago the paper changed hands:
its offices were shifted to New York, and it has been at one time primarily an organ of
rebellious literary youth, and at another a Radical political journal. The latest remodelling
promises stability. The <i>Dial</i> appears as a purely literary and artistic monthly, in
shape like one of our own monthly reviews, and typographically superior to most of
them. We await its development with interest.</p>

<span class="i0">Against the ways of Tubal Cain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, sharp was their song!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The demons in the bricks, the demons in the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The demons in the bank-vaults peered out to see us pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the angels in the trees, the angels in the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The angels in the flags peered out to see us pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sidewalk was our chariot, and the flowers bloomed higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the street turned to silver and the grass turned to fire,<br /></span>

<h2>BLIND THAMYRIS</h2>

<p class="center">By T. STURGE MOORE</p>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">SINCE</span> my father was a hero and my mother a goddess of the woods,
I was sent when twelve years old to the cave of Chiron, that
he might instruct me in wisdom and valour. This life, divorced
from all female tenderness, appealed to my pride, and only at
night were my eyes ever moistened with regret. I was now free to follow
a stream until, too weary to advance further, some cradle of scented herbs
would lure me to rest and doze. At length twilight brought me an energy,
winged with dread of the dusking forests, that carried me right home to
the cavern. The sources were always my goal, the more easy descent seawards
never tempted my morning moods: and, as he taught me the lyre or the
control of my voice, Chiron remarked that a similar bent was evinced by
an instinctive preference for those words and cadences that lead the spirit
away from the high-roads of thought and feeling. Surely emotions well up
in the fastnesses of tranquillity, close under the blue and white of heaven,
more virginal than can be experienced in lowland retreats? As time wore
on, Chiron, the daily lesson being ended, began to speak to me of a rhapsodist,
former pupil and great favourite of his. "Agenor," he began, "like thyself,
Thamyris was ever striving to reach the summits before joint and sinew
were sufficiently tough. Alas, though he has often brought back with him
the rarest strophes and melodies, men have refused to listen to them! They
prefer a music that better harmonises with their garish sea-board towns,
and he wanders shrouded in an ever deeper gloom." With a sigh he paused,
and I waited, expecting to be warned not thus to estrange myself from
humanity by persistently climbing among the hills. But he seemed unable
so to conclude, and presently bid me run away and practise throwing the
spear.</p>

<p>One forenoon when wind, so strong as to seem foreign to the settled
brilliance of the weather, was bowing the fir-trees, and now here, now there,
their backs arched silverly, flashing like waves on the dark green ridges,
while the sound was that of a chorus of Titans rejoicing in violence (so much
so that we had to retreat well back within the cave before we could hear
ourselves play or sing), Chiron broke off the lesson, still disturbed it may
be by the hurly-burly without, though it strained but faintly through the
stillness held under that roof of rock. He sat gazing forth into the sunny
turbulence, so grandly though jaggedly framed; and I, leaning back against
his flank, watched his moved visage worn with much living. Then for the
first time he began to recite me actual words of Thamyris, recalling how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
their public delivery had proved that those who thronged round the other
rhapsodists would never collect about him.</p>

<p>Chiron was silent, and I dreamed of finding and putting on the slough
of Apollo. I saw myself in a sultry glare climbing boulders with grey lichen-crusted
cheeks, and dark moss-bearded cavities down which I peered in
hopes of finding a cupful of collected dew. At last I arrived on the crest,
and there, at the bottom of a crater of wild tumbled blocks, lay gleaming
somewhat silver and violet and blue. I scrambled down; a pattern of scaled
serpents was looped inextricably over white samite. I lifted it, and from the
inside there slipped with a swish a body-vest of pale vermilion rippled with
gold in a device of arrows, each drawn to the head in a sturdy bow: an
armoury of the proper size for an host of mice had it been real instead of
pictured. I gasped; and Chiron's eyes met mine, so that I blushed all down
my neck.</p>

<p>Months later, on my return at dusk from a day's ramble, I learned from
our new pupil, the little Achilles, that Chiron had been fetched away by
two other centaurs, and expected to be absent all night, perhaps longer.
We prepared and ate our supper of chestnuts boiled and then mashed in
milk, and were shortly rolled in separate bears' skins to sleep. Achilles,
who was but just turned six, was soon off, but I lay hour after hour forecasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">405</a></span>
coming events with eyes wide open. I cannot now revive those dreamy
adventures, and only recollect that Thamyris figured in no few, and how
fevered I was by the thought that, being mysteriously like him, much
sadness and disappointment lay in wait for me. At last moonlight began
to edge into the cave; travelling along the wall it soon lit up a trophy, the
skull and huge hooped horns of an ibex; and next the rug made of four
chamois hides that Chiron hangs over his flanks and crupper in winter,
when round his bust he wraps thick folds of brown knitted wool; not long
after it was bathing the ebony lyre inlaid with polished iridescent sea-shell
that has both its fluted pillars and their screw-heads enamelled with lines
of scarlet. This wonder Jason had brought back from Colchis and sent up
by an embassy to Chiron. I rose and, stealing softly to it, looked up, not at
the well-loved colours of the lyre, but towards the tranquil effulgence that
had woken them out of the darkness, and was surprised to see that there
were many swift-travelling clouds in the sky, for while I lay in the shelter
the night had seemed quite still. At that moment the moon was covered,
and the cave became so dark that I stepped outside and saw the moonlight
fast growing again on the lawn lower down, where we throw the spear
and wrestling matches take place. I hurried to meet it and, once there,
the terror and attraction of the hills at night shook me; for was I not brought
forth by the regent of a bosky grove? Though its sacred safety rustled
leagues from where I stood, might I not brave these mountain forests,
being able so to account for my hardihood? I was carried away, neither
walking nor running, but at a sort of shaken trot that seemed dictated by
the thudding of my heart. The almost level path wound along our valley
high above the torrent, which it would meet and cross some two miles
deeper in this fold under Pelion. My limbs moved as it were unbidden;
once or twice I stopped and said, "This is a dream," till the indescribable
reality of everything drove me on. My teeth were frequently jolted, yet
the cold did not seem intense enough to chatter them, and surely I was not
abjectly frightened? This notion roused my self-control and calmed me
till I slipped along like a peaceful thought, unchallenged yet alert. The
stream was crossed by the fallen fir-trunk, and the path returned eastward
on the opposite side of the valley till the distant mouth of the cave was
passed and the forefront of this new ridge won. Here the view was immense,
embracing islands in the sea and snowy Olympus and the unnumbered
chains of the mountainous coast. Here I squatted on the short fine turf
and folded both arms across my knees as a cushion for my chin. Perhaps
I dozed, for my head was heavy when I lifted it to make sure of a sound&mdash;the
trampling of centaurs a great way off. "They are returning," I said to
myself, and laid an ear against the earth, and then peered into the darkness,
for the moon lit nothing now except one band of sea far out behind the
islands. All but certain by which track they were coming, I plunged headlong
downward through the brushwood as though it had been broad day, intending
to cut their road on the moor above the cliffs. How many times I floundered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
into bushes or barked a shin against bough or boulder, those who have done
such things may imagine. I at last stumbled out on the heather hundreds of
feet beneath, limping but consoled to fancy my troubles ended. Before I
had cleared a thousand yards I fell, ricking my ankle, and rose with difficulty,
for an agony like death whenever my foot pressed the ground routed the
very notion of an inexhaustible endurance latent within me. I fell again
on to the thick springy couch of scented ling and soon felt deliciously
relieved. Violent activity had chased the last vestige of night-terror, and
the wind moaning round me made even that barren place homelike as with
the movements of a familiar presence. The slightest jerk to my right foot
and immediately my brow was beaded with sweat, for pain like a savage
dog held my ankle in its jaws, and would grind them anew if I stirred.
Hooves thundered nearer and nearer; the noise so invaded my consciousness
that to cry for help seemed as useless as to halloo against tempestuous
breakers on a rocky shore, yet simultaneously there returned on me all
that Chiron had taught of the diverse tribes of sound&mdash;how some are
irreconcilable while others easily agree, how the loudest of one family may
fail to drown small ones of distinct origin, and in a continuous and familiar
uproar their different calibre may startle even as in silence. Fed by these
memories hope grew strong, and I cried out, "Father Chiron, Father Chiron,
I am here, and must die if you do not come." Then I listened: all was still.
At first I feared they had reached the hills and entered the valley so that
the sound of their trampling was walled off. Just then it began again more
slowly and unexpectedly near, so I shouted, "Father Chiron, do not leave
me to the wolves!" Then his voice answered, and tears streamed over my
face and sobs so shook me that I could not make out his words, yet between
the spasms I gasped, "This way, this way!" And he came and knelt beside
me, first on his fore-knees, then settling down on his haunches gradually
so as not to scare me by the blundering of his fetlocks. His large gentle
hand felt my moist burning brow while I pointed at my helpless ankle;
then he lifted it between thumb and finger, and with the index of the other
hand began to stroke the swelling thoughtfully. Then lifting his head he
shouted, "Rhoetus, find me some sorrel or lettuce, and if you see any
straight wands cut me one or two. Catch! Here is my knife!" and he
slipped the thong by which it hung over his head. Now I must tell you it
was a delicately smithied blade with both edges sharp, and lived, point
foremost, in a snug trough cut along the yellow boxwood handle over which
a lid of box was spliced, the open end being secured by a wedge of ebony
attached by a thong. For use, the blade was first shaken out on the palm,
then its heft-end replaced and secured by tapping the wedge with a stone.
It was our great pleasure to borrow this knife and scratch lions or eagles
upon a horn, or out of soft pine carve straight-robed Athena with casque
and spear. I know every cut that defines her attitude, but can never give her
features, either terrible or beautiful. But Chiron was repeating to me, "Did
not Achilles tell you that I could not be back before morning?" for my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
mind had suddenly wandered to my foster-mother's farm kitchen in the
lowlands forty miles away. "Yes, he told me, but I could not sleep, and
at last I wanted to explore the woods by moonlight; after I heard you coming,
in running I caught my foot in the twisted trunks of this heather," With a
low husky chuckle he said, "Though I am supposed to be really wise, the
simplicity of your explanation has surprised me harbouring sinister forebodings."
I had no inkling then how he dreaded lest the violence of centaur-herds
and the knavery of townsmen, like clashing flints, should cause a
conflagration. For ever more pressingly he forebodes the violation of his
cavern's peace, the only spot left where men and centaurs foregather kindly.
At that time I attributed his words to the ocean of his wisdom, which, like
a shore-bred child, I was accustomed to hear murmur, content if now and
again the beauty of a thought meant for me stranded like a dainty shell at
my feet. Hitherto I had lain like one bed-rid, haunted by the seriousness
of that pain, but now, sitting up and taking advantage of the licence accorded
to sufferers, I dared to show a curiosity which every endeavour would have
suppressed had my right ankle been as sound as the left, and asked, "Where
have you been, Father Chiron?" His husky laugh allowed the indulgence
I had claimed, and his voice grew strained as he answered, "I was called
to the death-bed of my best-beloved son Thamyris." "Is he very sick?"
I asked. "Not now, for he moaned me his last epode and ended like the
swan." At that I lay back once more and looked across the heather at the
moon, unwilling to embarrass his sorrow by staring at it. And after a pause
Chiron in a very low voice began to croon:</p>

<p>When silence had nursed the memory of this for a space I glanced at
Chiron; his wet eyes stared steadily at the moon. He roused himself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
began to shout to hasten Rhoetus, and the young centaur soon approached,
bounding wildly, a mat of tresses flapping like a black flag about his head.
Chiron took the knife, the leaves and the two sallows, and measuring these
last against my leg cut two wands from their stouter ends, split them and
placed their flat sides against the leaves in which he packed my tender
joint. He next cut strands from under his white beard as long as his arm;
with one he bound the splints lightly round my calf and with the other
secured them beneath my foot. Rising, he helped me up, and warned me
not to put any weight on the cage, which lengthened and imprisoned my
leg. He then signed to Rhoetus to lift me on to his back, and side by side
the two began walking across the heath; the sky was once more almost
clear and the moon was setting. The sea, though it could be heard, was
hidden by the heathery hillocks which thatched its cliffs, as Olympus and
the great ranges were behind hills tawny and russet with beech and alder
but hooded in evergreen firs that towered dead black in the moonlight.
A whistle sounded, and there was Caudon waiting three hundred paces
off. Rhoetus advanced, crying to him, "It is my turn to carry the body now,"
but his piebald fellow immediately heaved something on to his shoulder
and set off at a gallop. "What is it?" I said to Chiron, round whose vast
waist my arms clung. "They shame our breed," he replied. "Ghosts of
the dead never haunt centaurs, so for them the lifeless body is no more than
an empty smock. Men are born with older fears and cradled in whispering
awe. Reverence is thus taught them, first by terror, and then by esteem, if
they consort with finely-tempered minds. But these rough colts, deprived
of the first, scarce heed the second lesson yet. Poor Thamyris, the fair course
of thy days was driven about till, willy-nilly, it clashed with the coarse-grained
crowd; and must thy body be tossed, fought for, and whirled away
in the fury of this boisterous rivalry?" They were fetching wide curves
across the heath; sometimes even Caudon's piebald flanks were lost in the
darkness, and they became a mere chivy of distancing sounds; then again
both toiled on the skyline above the cliffs, like shadows on a wall. Their
shouts had at first betokened no more than horse-play, but took now an
angrier accent. Chiron smartened his pace, and I felt that his spirit was
chafing, and when they next drew within earshot he shouted commands
to arrest them of such sternness as they were not sufficiently enslaved by
passion to disregard, and they came severally, muttering, heated, and
resentful towards us. The old centaur reproached them for thus jolting
the body of his friend. "But he feels nothing," argued Caudon. "Well, well,
had he been a skin of choice wine, you should have carried him with more
care." "Wine can be spoilt with shaking&mdash;but a corpse!" grumbled
Rhoetus. "Still for all he once was ..." "Why, he was so mad as
to put out his own eyes!" grunted Caudon, and Rhoetus continued,
"They say he died because he refused to eat in a rage that outlasted his
life." "Yet I, who am old enough to be your sire's grandsire, have often
wished the hour stayed when his fingers wandered the strings." "Years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
ago!" they interjected. "Last evening he kissed my hands and taught
me words that fly straight to the heart." Neither colt retorted, and the
silence seemed so consecrated to the gravity of the wise Chiron's sorrow
that I feared to break it, though devoured with curiosity about this unaccountable
madness, blindness, and death. We had entered the valley
and were climbing at a foot-pace among the trees. Though the moon had
set, the sky had not darkened but greyed with the dawn. As the light increased
the body absorbed my attention; it hung wrapped in a coarse and torn cloak
over Rhoetus's shoulder; for Caudon had ceded it to him soon after they
left arguing with Chiron. The arms dangled along his muscular back and
the dead hands flopped and turned upon the glossy black hide to which his
brown skin gave place below the loins. They went a little in advance of us,
and at times I could divine just how the head hung, by some yellow hair
that appeared and disappeared behind a rent in the cloak which, swaying,
opened and closed like the ill-hinged door of a granary loft that, swinging
in the wind, shows the gleam of golden grain to a mid-winter day. My
head had dropped in a doze before we reached the place where a path
branches down to the bathing pool, and Chiron bade Rhoetus and Caudon
carry the body up to the cave, build a fire, and seethe meat, for all would be
more than common hungry. But me he carried down to the large pool that
spreads out from the foot of a fall in the torrent; and at the outer brim of
this basin, where the clear water becomes shallow and escapes in many
minor cascades downwards, he chose a bank of sward and laid me gently
down where the water would flow over my damaged foot. While I lounged
at ease he himself gravely walked down under the pool; the water rose
above the horse and only the man remained; still he trod carefully deeper,
the white stones being often slippery with green weed; and now his beard
and hair were floating like foam about his shoulders, as though a smaller
column of invisible water were drilling the quivering surface right out
in front of the torrent that thundered into boiling suds at the foot of the
dripping rocks. Still his hooves felt their way down, till the billowy outward
curves were sweeping right over his head. The white limestone lit up the
depths and rendered his figure clearly visible, though it seemed strangely
stunted; his chestnut crupper, silvered as it was with age, became violet by
contrast with the icy blue water. All around thinned boughs hung out
long yellow leaves, and the reflections of some of them flickered like fish
about him. Time seemed to have ceased and all hostile conditions to have
been suspended in favour of this magnificently weathered creature, that
he might become divinely amphibious and death stand disarmed before him.
Far above, a level shaft of sunlight from over the mountain shoulder
suddenly caught the tree-tops. A naked scaffold of dark trunk, bough and
intricately forking branch sustained each thin tower-like tent of brilliant
leaves. Thus, their grand swelling shapes hollow instead of dense with
foliage, tanned or yellow instead of green, these chestnuts whose flaunting
camps reach far up the valleys made a last stand against the disenchanting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
season of storms. The banks beneath were thick with fallen leaves interspersed
with clusters of nuts like hedgehogs. The whole vividly coloured
scene swam in the limpid transparent slumber which tuned my breathing,
though it had not closed my eyes. I thought, "He will stay under too long
and I shall never hear how poor Thamyris went mad," yet it seemed
acceptable or at least necessary that I should never hear and that he should
remain immersed for ever. No, he lifted his head and parted his hair and
rubbed his eyes, and came up as slowly and solemnly out of the pool as he
had descended into it. Streaming and refreshed, he cantered round its shallow
brim, splashing with his hooves; he shook and wrung from hair and beard
streamers of diamond drops, quivering the while the glossy coat of his
nether body to free its shaggy skirts, and whisking his tail against his hocks.
Pausing beside me, he smiled into my sleepy eyes and said, "How goes
the ankle?" I murmured that it was so cold as to have stopped aching, and
I could not now feel whether it were there or not. He drew me a little
higher up till my bandaged foot was out of the numbing flow. Roused by
this I could no longer refrain from asking what had driven poor Thamyris
mad; and the answer came, soothing the terror that it stirred in my soul by
the grave compassion with which it was pronounced. "He could not endure
to watch those whose attention he had in vain tried to capture, grouped
about some common rhapsodist who, with shouts, recounted how one
man killed another in some freebooting foray. He must have wandered
unwanted and uninspired for months before at last he stood near the ships
where fishermen had been chipping holes in large flints in order to thread
them along the bottom of their great sweep-net. These had often split
before they were pierced, and fragments with knife-like edges lay all about.
Suddenly dashing down his lyre, he stooped and seized two sharp pieces,
and sobbing out that his eyes should never again watch a crowd like that
gaping upon the wharf at this bawler, he jabbed at his eyes. Others told me
how they heard him, and turned to see blood streaming from his face and
beard and from the two red hands that he waved as he staggered, unaccustomed
to darkness. They thought some goddess in the shape of a sea-hawk
must have struck him with her beak, and vanished as swiftly as she had
come through the twilight. Afterward, when his broken lyre was found,
they concluded that the Muses had sent her because he, though a mere
mortal, sang such songs as might in the halls of Olympus be preferred to
their own, for only among the gods, as those fishermen fancied, could he
have found suitable audience. They led him to the temple of Apollo; there
the priest killed a snake and bound its body across his bleeding orbits, and
the wounds healed, but sight did not return. Later on, when he felt how
he never knew where he was or who was near&mdash;when no one could lead him
far towards the stony peaks he loved, for dread always overtook them at the
danger of steep places for a blind man whose daimon left him totally unwarned&mdash;he
refused food and sat all day on the temple steps, and never
begged an alms or stooped to gather what was thrown him. At night the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
hierodules had sometimes heard him mutter as though he prayed for
vengeance. They even believed that he had challenged the nine Muses to a
trial of skill, offering to yield body and mind to their displeasure if he failed,
but should he outsing them, then each of them was to submit her body to
bear him a child. For servile minds, Agenor, ascribe the motives familiar to
themselves to those whose outstanding actions they must perforce canvass.
Thus he endured not only perpetual darkness, but companionless solitude
where streams of men were constantly passing; hearing voices but not one
conversable. Then when death first warned him, he sent a message to me;
this was delivered to Rhoetus and Caudon, who bore it on up the shoulders
of Pelion." And gazing round, he continued, "In this spot shall he rest,
screened by these chestnuts from the cruel moons of summer; here shall a
grave be dug. The distance from the cave is convenient, and bathers may often
consent to remain while I rechant one of his lays, till, departing, they
breathe a pious wish for the peace of him whose life was full of strife and
storms, though he never joined in battle, or trod the planks of a ship. When
I stood by his side he said, 'O god-like beast, no other ears ever listened to
me with pleasure as thine did. Thou hast been rewarded with extended
life, for thy actions and customs are swayed neither by fear nor by greed,
but in the eyes of the young and in quiet haunts thou hast sought the wisdom
most easily wed to divine melodies. Thou wilt understand and perhaps
pity these strophes born of my anguish.' His fevered reveries would seem
so to have exalted me that he used an address such as gods expect, and with
the same trance-like utterance feebly and slowly delivered the hymn I
repeated to you on the heath, but then the end came. Now you had better
lie here for to-day lest you should jar that ankle, and I will send Achilles
to you with some meat." I wondered over all I had heard, not without
dread of a similar fate, till Achilles came and wanted to know what I had seen
in the night, whether nymphs or daimons or Artemis herself. As I ate the
warm meat or broke the brown crusts between sips of wine, I told him.
Then with all the roguish effrontery of his beauty, shaking his long yellow
curls, he laughed, "I should have done as you did for all the rest, Agenor,
but I should not have sprained my ankle," and he danced off singing,
"No, indeed, indeed no!" while I, dropping the drained horn into the empty
maple bowl, rolled over and slept.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>When I woke the sun had passed the meridian, and the sound of a spade
and the thud of falling clods could be heard, and looking across I saw
Caudon working in a grave on a crest of the opposite bank; soon the blade
rang on the rock and his action became that of shovelling out the loam.
Next, Chiron and Rhoetus arrived, carrying the body between them wound
in a long and splendid pall. This had been sent by Thetis as a present with
Achilles when he joined us in July. It measured six yards by four, and might
have served for a temple curtain or to drape a royal bed. The goddess herself
had worked it far out under the sea, aided by the silver-shoed daughters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
Doris. Flying over a ground of deep blue were seen harpies with black
wings spread and every feather tipped with white, their brown bodies
shaped like large eggs; they wore coral necklaces, and had the heads of
women with singing mouths and long streaming raven curls. Yet they were
armless and had the legs and talons of a bird. Each of the score was exactly
like every other, and side by side and one after another they flew across the
deep noon sky. So they sweep by close above some ship, with sweet voices
advising mariners of a greater glory amid ocean than where sails are often
met around the coast. Though well they know that from the vacant
unislanded main the venturer has rarely returned. Chiron had no use in his
cavern for a cloth so splendid, and he had determined to devote this to the
honour of Thamyris. They laid his body, wholly enveloped in it, along the
turf beside the grave, while they spread in it the autumn-tinted bracken
that Achilles had been cutting with a sickle, and, armful after armful,
had made a mountainous heap of. Next they lowered him in the great blue
cloth on to that sun-saturated couch. Then Chiron took his lyre and
sang:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A gentle spring was that long past<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which brought thee to my cave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thought yet more than action brave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O daring spirit, now thou hast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleaned all that feeble mortals give<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those in whom intenser joy has sought to live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here woodland peace broods ever, here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall water alway carol in thine ear.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Caudon and Rhoetus now chanted the usual chorus of "Last Farewell,"
Achilles and myself piping in as well as their loud voices would let us.
The rest of the bracken was then thrown down and on that the dark
loam, the turfs were replaced, wine spilled in libation and grain
strewn. The rites were ended: the two centaurs shouldered spade
and mattock and clattered off. Achilles asked if he might go into
the woods with his bow and arrow to shoot something. Chiron nodded
consent and came to examine my ankle. While he uncased it and did it
up again with fresh leaves, I asked why, if Thamyris so loved the lonely
hills and scorned men, he was so angry at seeing them crowd about
other rhapsodists. When he had finished with my foot he replied, "One
of our friend's hymns is now trotting in my head," then touching his lyre
he chanted:</p>

<p>"There, that is his own answer to your question. I do not think he craved
just <i>any</i> praise, nor did he much over-prize his own gift; and you see he was
not thinking of this coast, but of one facing the other way, so that the poet
could arrive from the quarter opposite to the sun and meet him at noon on
the peak. As much as to say, 'Not myself, nor this town's people, but any
place, any people, any poet.' He worshipped man, and it angered him to
see homespun preferred to the skyey fabric the god had helped him weave.
He regretted his violence and could not live without those eyes it had cost
him." Having drawn these sentences one by one from his sad heart, Chiron
lapsed into silence till I asked, "But why did he address the Muses as
enemies in his last hymn, if what the folk said was quite false?" "It is
strange. Can they have appeared to him smartly fledged in white plumage,
with dapper tail and wings and vulture heart? Stately women clothed in
daffodil chitons delighted my gaze the only time I ever had a glimpse of
them." "When was that?" "I was scarcely older than yourself, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
woke in a cave to see them sitting and resting at its mouth, delicately grouped
against the dawn. I remember Euterpe's lap full of flowers, and Melpomene,
for her hair was stormy, black and unbound, and a deep brown cloak had
slipped from her shoulders, but still hung over her elbows; it was only
afterwards that I regretted not having noted the features of Urania, but
assuredly no single one of them had the eye of a hawk. They rose as I woke,
and strolled on. I crept after them, but when I turned the buttress of rock,
no glad-robed figure was in sight, though it seemed that choral voices
floated in the air; yet soon I found myself listening to silence, so could not
be sure." "It must be sad to sing unpraised, however beautiful the words."
"Yes, boy, and the ecstasy that sings is counterfaced with a destroying
rage; that is perhaps why his darkened soul figured the Muses as birds of
prey." "Do you know any more of his rhapsodies?" "Perhaps I can
recall another," and he struck some strange bell-like notes and then sang:</p>

<p>I covered this sheepskin years ago in the cave and have kept it ever since;
now I must soon bequeath it to the care of others. Achilles and Chiron
are both long since dead, and who wants to hear the lays of Thamyris now?
I never picked up the slough of any god; though a bit later, when my foot
was sufficiently healed for me to limp about, I found behind some bushes,
where Caudon or Rhoetus had chucked it, the filthy ragged homespun
mantle of Thamyris, for when I spread it out one could see where the blood
had run down from his eyes by the dark stains. I folded it and laid it at
the foot of his grave and raised a pyramid of stones over it, bringing them
toilsomely from the pool each day as my ankle grew stronger, even as in
two or three years' time I was adding crooked letter to crooked letter on the
inside of this skin that Thamyris might be remembered. And as I wrote
I was persuaded, in spite of Chiron's presentiment and that vivid dream
of a white chlamys broidered over with blue, violet, and silver serpents,
that such "magnificent joys" would never be mine. Which secret conviction,
as I grew a beard and it grew grey, has been proved correct.
Maeonides, best loved of all rhapsodists, may have found it, though when
I heard him chant the war for Troy, he also was dressed in homespun and
already blind; but old Agenor has kept his two eyes as safely as this sheepskin.</p>

<h2>THE ROMANCE OF RHYME</h2>

<p class="center">By G. K. CHESTERTON</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> poet in the comic opera, it will be remembered (I hope),
claimed for his æsthetic authority that "Hey diddle diddle
will rank as an idyll, if I pronounce it chaste." In face of a satire
which still survives the fashion it satirised, it may require some
moral courage seriously to pronounce it chaste, or to suggest that the
nursery rhyme in question has really some of the qualities of an idyll. Of
its chastity, in the vulgar sense, there need be little dispute, despite the
scandal of the elopement of the dish with the spoon, which would seem as
free from grossness as the loves of the triangles. And though the incident of
the cow may have something of the moonstruck ecstasy of Endymion, that
also has a silvery coldness about it worthy of the wilder aspects of Diana.
The truth more seriously tenable is that this nursery rhyme is a complete
and compact model of the nursery short story. The cow jumping over the
moon fulfils to perfection the two essentials of such a story for children.
It makes an effect that is fantastic out of objects that are familiar;
and it makes a picture that is at once incredible and unmistakable. But it
is yet more tenable, and here more to the point, that this nursery
rhyme is emphatically a rhyme. Both the lilt and the jingle are just right for
their purpose, and are worth whole libraries of elaborate literary verse for
children. And the best proof of its vitality is that the satirist himself has
unconsciously echoed the jingle even in making the joke. The metre of that
nineteenth-century satire is the metre of the nursery rhyme. "Hey diddle
diddle, the cat and the fiddle" and "Hey diddle diddle will rank as an idyll"
are obviously both dancing to the same ancient tune; and that by no means
the tune the old cow died of, but the more exhilarating air to which she
jumped over the moon.</p>

<p>The whole history of the thing called rhyme can be found between those
two things: the simple pleasure of rhyming "diddle" to "fiddle," and the
more sophisticated pleasure of rhyming "diddle" to "idyll." Now the
fatal mistake about poetry, and more than half of the fatal mistake about
humanity, consists in forgetting that we should have the first kind of pleasure
as well as the second. It might be said that we should have the first pleasure
as the basis of the second; or yet more truly, the first pleasure inside the
second. The fatal metaphor of progress, which means leaving things behind
us, has utterly obscured the real idea of growth, which means leaving things
inside us. The heart of the tree remains the same, however many rings are added
to it; and a man cannot leave his heart behind by running hard with his legs.
In the core of all culture are the things that may be said, in every sense, to be
learned by heart. In the innermost part of all poetry is the nursery rhyme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
the nonsense that is too happy even to care about being nonsensical. It may
lead on to the more elaborate nonsense of the Gilbertian line, or even the
far less poetic nonsense of some of the Browningesque rhymes. But the true
enjoyment of poetry is always in having the simple pleasure as well as the
subtle pleasure. Indeed it is on this primary point that so many of our
artistic and other reforms seem to go wrong. What is the matter with the
modern world is that it is trying to get simplicity in everything except the
soul. Where the soul really has simplicity it can be grateful for anything&mdash;even
complexity. Many peasants have to be vegetarians, and their ordinary
life is really a simple life. But the peasants do not despise a good dinner when
they can get it; they wolf it down with enthusiasm, because they have not
only the simple life but the simple spirit. And it is so with the modern modes
of art which revert, very rightly, to what is "primitive." But their moral
mistake is that they try to combine the ruggedness that should belong to
simplicity with a superciliousness that should only belong to satiety. The last
Futurist draughtsmanship, for instance, evidently has the aim of drawing a
tree as it might be drawn by a child of ten. I think the new artists would
admit it; nor do I merely sneer at it. I am willing to admit, especially for the
sake of argument, that there is a truth of philosophy and psychology in this
attempt to attain the clarity even through the crudity of childhood. In this
sense I can see what a man is driving at when he draws a tree merely as a
stick with smaller sticks standing out of it. He may be trying to trace in
black and white or grey a primeval and almost pre-natal illumination; that
it is very remarkable that a stick should exist, and still more remarkable
that a stick should stick up or stick out. He may be similarly enchanted with
his own stick of charcoal or grey chalk; he may be enraptured, as a child is,
with the mere fact that it makes a mark on the paper&mdash;a highly poetic fact in
itself. But the child does not despise the real tree for being different from his
drawing of the tree. He does not despise Uncle Humphrey because that
talented amateur can really draw a tree. He does not think less of the real
sticks because they are live sticks, and can grow and branch and curve in a
way uncommon in walking-sticks. Because he has a single eye he can enjoy a
double pleasure. This distinction, which seems strangely neglected, may be
traced again in the drama and most other domains of art. Reformers insist
that the audiences of simpler ages were content with bare boards or rudimentary
scenery if they could hear Sophocles or Shakespeare talking a
language of the gods. They were very properly contented with plain boards.
But they were not discontented with pageants. The people who appreciated
Antony's oration as such would have appreciated Aladdin's palace as such.
They did not think gilding and spangles substitutes for poetry and philosophy,
because they are not. But they did think gilding and spangles great and
admirable gifts of God, because they are.</p>

<p>But the application of this distinction here is to the case of rhyme in
poetry. And the application of it is that we should never be ashamed of
enjoying a thing as a rhyme as well as enjoying it as a poem. And I think the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
modern poets who try to escape from the rhyming pleasure, in pursuit of a
freer poetical pleasure, are making the same fundamentally fallacious
attempt to combine simplicity with superiority. Such a poet is like a child
who could take no pleasure in a tree because it looked like a tree, or a playgoer
who could take no pleasure in the Forest of Arden because it looked like a
forest. It is not impossible to find a sort of prig who professes that he could
listen to literature in any scenery, but strongly objects to good scenery.
And in poetical criticism and creation there has also appeared the prig who
insists that any new poem must avoid the sort of melody that makes the
beauty of any old song. Poets must put away childish things, including the
child's pleasure in the mere sing-song of irrational rhyme. It may be hinted
that when poets put away childish things they will put away poetry. But
it may be well to say a word in further justification of rhyme as well as poetry,
in the child as well as the poet. Now, the neglect of this nursery instinct
would be a blunder, even if it were merely an animal instinct or an automatic
instinct. If a rhyme were to a man merely what a bark is to a dog, or a crow
to a cock, it would be clear that such natural things cannot be merely
neglected. It is clear that a canine epic, about Argus instead of Ulysses,
would have a beat ultimately consisting of barks. It is clear that a long poem
like <i>Chantecler</i>, written by a real cock, would be to the tune of Cock-a-doodle-doo.
But in truth the nursery rhyme has a nobler origin; if it be
ancestral it is not animal; its principle is a primary one, not only in the body
but in the soul.</p>

<p>Milton prefaced <i>Paradise Lost</i> with a ponderous condemnation of rhyme.
And perhaps the finest and even the most familiar line in the whole of
<i>Paradise Lost</i> is really a glorification of rhyme. "Seasons return, but not to
me return," is not only an echo that has all the ring of a rhyme in its form, but
it happens to contain nearly all the philosophy of rhyme in its spirit. The
wonderful word "return" has, not only in its sound but in its sense, a hint
of the whole secret of song. It is not merely that its very form is a fine example
of a certain quality in English, somewhat similar to that which Mrs. Meynell
admirably analysed in a former issue of this magazine in the case of words
like "unforgiven." It is that it describes poetry itself, not only in a mechanical
but a moral sense. Song is not only a recurrence, it is a return. It does not
merely, like the child in the nursery, take pleasure in seeing the wheels go
round. It also wishes to go back as well as round; to go back to the nursery
where such pleasures are found. Or to vary the metaphor slightly, it does not
merely rejoice in the rotation of a wheel on the road, as if it were a fixed
wheel in the air. It is not only the wheel but the waggon that is returning.
That labouring caravan is always travelling towards some camping-ground
that it has lost and cannot find again. No lover of poetry needs to be told
that all poems are full of that noise of returning wheels; and none more than
the poems of Milton himself. The whole truth is obvious, not merely in the
poem, but even in the two words of the title. All poems might be bound in
one book under the title of <i>Paradise Lost</i>. And the only object of writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
<i>Paradise Lost</i> is to turn it, if only by a magic and momentary illusion,
into <i>Paradise Regained</i>.</p>

<p>It is in this deeper significance of return that we must seek for the peculiar
power in the recurrence we call rhyme. It would be easy enough to reply to
Milton's strictures on rhyme in the spirit of a sensible if superficial liberality
by saying that it takes all sorts to make a world, and especially the world of
the poets. It is evident enough that Milton might have been right to dispense
with rhyme without being right to despise it. It is obvious that the peculiar
dignity of his religious epic would have been weakened if it had been a
rhymed epic, beginning:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Of man's first disobedience and the fruit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that forbidden tree whose mortal root.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">But it is equally obvious that Milton himself would not have tripped on the
light fantastic toe with quite so much charm and cheerfulness in the lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But come thou Goddess fair and free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In heaven yclept Euphrosyne<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">if the goddess had been yclept something else, as, for the sake of argument,
Syrinx. Milton in his more reasonable moods would have allowed rhyme in
theory a place in all poetry, as he allowed it in practice in his own poetry.
But he would certainly have said at this time, and possibly at all times, that
he allowed it an inferior place, or at least a secondary place. But is its place
secondary; and is it in any sense inferior?</p>

<p>The romance of rhyme does not consist merely in the pleasure of a jingle,
though this is a pleasure of which no man should be ashamed. Certainly
most men take pleasure in it, whether or not they are ashamed of it. We see it
in the older fashion of prolonging the chorus of a song with syllables like
"rumty tumty" or "tooral looral." We see it in the similar but later fashion
of discussing whether a truth is objective or subjective, or whether a reform
is constructive or destructive, or whether an argument is deductive or
inductive: all bearing witness to a very natural love for those nursery
rhyme recurrences which make a sort of song without words, or at least
without any kind of intellectual significance. But something much deeper is
involved in the love of rhyme as distinct from other poetic forms, something
which is perhaps too deep and subtle to be described. The nearest approximation
to the truth I can think of is something like this: that while all forms
of genuine verse recur, there is in rhyme a sense of return to exactly the same
place. All modes of song go forward and backward like the tides of a sea;
but in the great sea of Homeric or Virgilian hexameters, the sea that carried
the labouring ships of Ulysses and Æneas, the thunder of the breakers is
rhythmic, but the margin of the foam is necessarily irregular and vague.
In rhyme there is rather a sense of water poured safely into one familiar
well, or (to use a nobler metaphor) of ale poured safely into one familiar
flagon. The armies of Homer and Virgil advance and retreat over a vast
country, and suggest vast and very profound sentiments about it, about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
whether it is their own country or only a strange country. But when the old
nameless ballad boldly rhymes "the bonny ivy tree" to "my ain countree"
the vision at once dwindles and sharpens to a very vivid image of a single
soldier passing under the ivy that darkens his own door. Rhythm deals with
similarity, but rhyme with identity. Now in the one word identity are involved
perhaps the deepest and certainly the dearest human things. He who is homesick
does not desire houses or even homes. He who is lovesick does not
want to see all the women with whom he might have fallen in love. Only he
who is sea-sick, perhaps, may be said to have a cosmopolitan craving for all
lands or any kind of land. And this is probably why sea-sickness, like cosmopolitanism,
has never yet been a high inspiration to song. Songs, especially
the most poignant of them, generally refer to some absolute, to some positive
place or person for whom no similarity is a substitute. In such a case all
approximation is merely asymptotic. The prodigal returns to his father's
house and not the house next door, unless he is still an imperfectly sober
prodigal; the lover desires his lady and not her twin sister, except in old
complications of romance; and even the spiritualist is generally looking for
a ghost and not merely for ghosts. I think the intolerable torture of spiritualism
must be a doubt about identity. Anyhow, it will generally be found
that where this call for the identical has been uttered most ringingly
and unmistakably in literature, it has been uttered in rhyme. Another
purpose for which this pointed and definite form is very much fitted
is the expression of dogma, as distinct from doubt or even opinion. This
is why, with all allowance for a decline in the most classical effects of
the classical tongue, the rhymed Latin of the mediæval hymns does express
what it had to express in a very poignant poetical manner, as compared with
the reverent agnosticism so nobly uttered in the rolling unrhymed metres of
the ancients. For even if we regard the matter of the mediæval verses as a
dream, it was at least a vivid dream, a dream full of faces, a dream of love
and of lost things. And something of the same spirit runs in a vaguer way
through proverbs and phrases that are not exactly religious, but rather in a
rude sense philosophical, but which all move with the burden of returning;
things to be felt only in familiar fragments ... <i>on revient toujours</i> ... it's
the old story&mdash;it's love that makes the world go round; and all
roads lead to Rome: we might almost say that all roads lead to Rhyme.</p>

<p>Milton's revolt against rhyme must be read in the light of history. Milton
is the Renascence frozen into a Puritan form; the beginning of a period
which was in a sense classic, but was in a still more definite sense aristocratic.
There the Classicist was the artistic aristocrat because the Calvinist was the
spiritual aristocrat. The seventeenth century was intensely individualistic;
it had both in the noble and the ignoble sense a respect for persons. It had
no respect whatever for popular traditions; and it was in the midst of its
purely logical and legal excitement that most of the popular traditions died.
The Parliament appeared and the people disappeared. The arts were put
under patrons, where they had once been under patron saints. The schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
and colleges at once strengthened and narrowed the New Learning, making
it something rather peculiar to one country and one class. A few men talked
a great deal of good Latin, where all men had once talked a little bad Latin.
But they talked even the good Latin so that no Latinist in the world could
understand them. They confined all study of the classics to that of the most
classical period, and grossly exaggerated the barbarity and barrenness of
patriotic Greek or mediæval Latin. It is as if a man said that because the
English translation of the Bible is perhaps the best English in the world,
therefore Addison and Pater and Newman are not worth reading. We can
imagine what men in such a mood would have said of the rude rhymed
hexameters of the monks; and it is not unnatural that they should have felt a
reaction against rhyme itself. For the history of rhyme is the history of something
else, very vast and sometimes invisible, certainly somewhat indefinable,
against which they were in aristocratic rebellion.</p>

<p>That thing is difficult to define in impartial modern terms. It might well be
called Romance, and that even in a more technical sense, since it corresponds
to the rise of the Romance languages as distinct from the Roman language.
It might more truly be called Religion, for historically it was the gradual
re-emergence of Europe through the Dark Ages, because it still had one
religion, though no longer one rule. It was, in short, the creation of
Christendom. It may be called Legend, for it is true that the most overpowering
presence in it is that of omnipresent and powerful popular legend;
so that things that may never have happened, or, as some say, could never
have happened, are nevertheless rooted in our racial memory like things
that have happened to ourselves. The whole Arthurian Cycle, for instance,
seems something more real than reality. If the faces in that darkness of the
Dark Ages, Lancelot and Arthur and Merlin and Modred, are indeed faces
in a dream, they are like faces in a real dream: a dream in a bed and not a
dream in a book. Subconsciously at least, I should be much less surprised if
Arthur were to come again than I should be if the Superman were to come
at all. Again, the thing might be called Gossip: a noble name, having in it
the name of God and one of the most generous and genial of the relations
of men. For I suppose there has seldom been a time when such a mass of
culture and good traditions of craft and song have been handed down orally,
by one universal buzz of conversation, through centuries of ignorance down
to centuries of greater knowledge. Education must have been an eternal
<i>viva voce</i> examination; but the men passed their examination. At least they
went out in such rude sense masters of art as to create the Song of Roland
and the round Roman arches that carry the weight of so many Gothic towers.
Finally, of course, it can be called ignorance, barbarism, black superstition,
a reaction towards obscurantism and old night; and such a view is eminently
complete and satisfactory, only that it leaves behind it a sort of weak wonder
as to why the very youngest poets do still go on writing poems about the
sword of Arthur and the horn of Roland.</p>

<p>All this was but the beginning of a process which has two great points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
interest. The first is the way in which the mediæval movement did rebuild
the old Roman civilisation; the other was the way in which it did not. A
strange interest attaches to the things which had never existed in the pagan
culture and did appear in the Christian culture. I think it is true of most of
them that they had a quality that can very approximately be described as
popular, or perhaps as vulgar, as indeed we still talk of the languages which
at that time liberated themselves from Latin as the vulgar tongues. And to
many Classicists these things would appear to be vulgar in a more vulgar
sense. They were vulgar in the sense of being vivid almost to excess, of
making a very direct and unsophisticated appeal to the emotions. The first
law of heraldry was to wear the heart upon the sleeve. Such mediævalism
was the reverse of mere mysticism, in the sense of mere mystery; it might
more truly be described as sensationalism. One of these things, for instance,
was a hot and even an impatient love of colour. It learned to paint before it
could draw, and could afford the twopence coloured long before it could
manage the penny plain. It culminated at last, of course, in the energy and
gaiety of the Gothic; but even the richness of Gothic rested on a certain
psychological simplicity. We can contrast it with the classic by noting its
popular passion for telling a story in stone. We may admit that a Doric
portico is a poem, but no one would describe it as an anecdote. The time was
to come when much of the imagery of the cathedrals was to be lost; but it
would have mattered the less that it was defaced by its enemies if it had not
been already neglected by its friends. It would have mattered less if the
whole tide of taste among the rich had not turned against the old popular
masterpieces. The Puritans defaced them, but the Cavaliers did not truly
defend them. The Cavaliers also were aristocrats of the new classical culture,
and used the word Gothic in the sense of barbaric. For the benefit of the
Teutonists we may note in parenthesis that, if this phrase meant that Gothic
was despised, it also meant that Goths were despised. But when the Cavaliers
came back, after the Puritan interregnum, they restored not in the style of
Pugin but in the style of Wren. The very thing we call the Restoration,
which was the restoration of King Charles, was also the restoration of St.
Paul's. And it was a very modern restoration.</p>

<p>So far we might say that simple people do not like simple things. This is
certainly true if we compare the classic with these highly-coloured things of
mediævalism, or all the vivid visions which first began to glow in the night
of the Dark Ages. Now, one of these things was the romantic expedient
called rhyme. And even in this, if we compare the two, we shall see something
of the same paradox by which the simple like complexities and the complex
like simplicities. The ignorant liked rich carvings and melodious and often
ingenious rhymes. The learned liked bare walls and blank verse. But in the
case of rhyme it is peculiarly difficult to define the double and yet very
definite truth. It is difficult to define the sense in which rhyme is artificial
and the sense in which it is simple. In truth it is simple because it is artificial.
It is an artifice of the kind enjoyed by children and other poetic people; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
is a toy. As a technical accomplishment it stands at the same distance from
the popular experience as the old popular sports. Like swimming, like
dancing, like drawing the bow, anybody can do it, but nobody can do it
without taking the trouble to do it; and only a few can do it very well. In a
hundred ways it was akin to that simple and even humble energy that made
all the lost glory of the guilds. Thus their rhyme was useful as well as ornamental.
It was not merely a melody but also a mnemonic; just as their towers
were not merely trophies but beacons and belfries. In another aspect rhyme
is akin to rhetoric, but of a very positive and emphatic sort: the coincidence
of sound giving the effect of saying, "It is certainly so." Shakespeare realised
this when he rounded off a fierce or romantic scene with a rhymed couplet.
I know that some critics do not like this, but I think there is a moment when
a drama ought to become a melodrama. Then there is a much older effect of
rhyme that can only be called mystical, which may seem the very opposite
of the utilitarian, and almost equally remote from the rhetorical. Yet it
shares with the former the tough texture of something not easily forgotten,
and with the latter the touch of authority which is the aim of all oratory.
The thing I mean may be found in the fact that so many of the old proverbial
prophecies, from Merlin to Mother Shipton, were handed down in
rhyme. It can be found in the very name of Thomas the Rhymer.</p>

<p>But the simplest way of putting this popular quality is in a single word:
it is a song. Rhyme corresponds to a melody so simple that it goes straight
like an arrow to the heart. It corresponds to a chorus so familiar and obvious
that all men can join in it. I am not disturbed by the suggestion that such an
arrow of song, when it hits the heart, may entirely miss the head. I am not
concerned to deny that the chorus may sometimes be a drunken chorus, in
which men have lost their heads to find their tongues. I am not defending
but defining; I am trying to find words for a large but elusive distinction
between certain things that are certainly poetry and certain other things
which are also song. Of course it is only an accident that Horace opens his
greatest series of odes by saying that he detests the profane populace and
wishes to drive them from his temple of poetry. But it is the sort of accident
that is almost an allegory. There is even a sense in which it has a practical
side. When all is said, <i>could</i> a whole crowd of men sing the "Descende
Cœlo," that noble ode, as a crowd can certainly sing the "Dies Irae," or for
that matter "Down among the Dead Men"? Did Horace himself sing the
Horatian odes in the sense in which Shakespeare could sing, or could
hardly help singing, the Shakespearean songs. I do not know, having no kind
of scholarship on these points. But I do not feel that it could have been at
all the same thing; and my only purpose is to attempt a rude description of
that thing. Rhyme is consonant to the particular kind of song that can be
a popular song, whether pathetic or passionate or comic; and Milton is
entitled to his true distinction; nobody is likely to sing <i>Paradise Lost</i> as
if it were a song of that kind. I have tried to suggest my sympathy with
rhyme, in terms true enough to be accepted by the other side as expressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
their antipathy for it. I have admitted that rhyme is a toy and even a trick,
of the sort that delights children. I have admitted that every rhyme is a
nursery rhyme. What I will never admit is that anyone who is too big for the
nursery is big enough for the Kingdom of God, though the God were only
Apollo.</p>

<p>A good critic should be like God in the great saying of a Scottish mystic.
George Macdonald said that God was easy to please and hard to satisfy.
That paradox is the poise of all good artistic appreciation. Without the first
part of the paradox appreciation perishes, because it loses the power to
appreciate. Good criticism, I repeat, combines the subtle pleasure in a thing
being done well with the simple pleasure in it being done at all. It combines
the pleasure of the scientific engineer in seeing how the wheels work
together to a logical end with the pleasure of the baby in seeing the wheels
go round. It combines the pleasure of the artistic draughtsman in the fact
that his lines of charcoal, light and apparently loose, fall exactly right and in
a perfect relation with the pleasure of the child in the fact that the charcoal
makes marks of any kind on the paper. And in the same fashion it combines
the critic's pleasure in a poem with the child's pleasure in a rhyme. The
historical point about this kind of poetry, the rhymed romantic kind, is that
it rose out of the Dark Ages with the whole of this huge popular power
behind it, the human love of a song, a riddle, a proverb, a pun or a nursery
rhyme; the sing-song of innumerable children's games, the chorus of a
thousand camp-fires and a thousand taverns. When poetry loses its link with
all these people who are easily pleased it loses all its power of giving
pleasure. When a poet looks down on a rhyme it is, I will not say as if he
looked down on a daisy (which might seem possible to the more literal-minded),
but rather as if he looked down on a lark because he had been up
in a balloon. It is cutting away the very roots of poetry; it is revolting
against nature because it is natural, against sunshine because it is bright, or
mountains because they are high, or moonrise because it is mysterious.
The freezing process began after the Reformation with a fastidious search
for finer yet freer forms; to-day it has ended in formlessness.</p>

<p>But the joke of it is that even when it is formless it is still fastidious.
The new anarchic artists are not ready to accept everything. They are not
ready to accept anything except anarchy. Unless it observes the very latest
conventions of unconventionality, they would rule out anything classic as
coldly as any classic ever ruled out anything romantic. But the classic was a
form; and there was even a time when it was a new form. The men who
invented Sapphics did invent a new metre; the introduction of Elizabethan
blank verse was a real revolution in literary form. But <i>vers libre</i>, or nine-tenths
of it, is not a new metre any more than sleeping in a ditch is a new
school of architecture. It is no more a revolution in literary form than eating
meat raw is an innovation in cookery. It is not even original, because it is not
creative; the artist does not invent anything, but only abolishes something.
But the only point about it that is to my present purpose is expressed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">425</a></span>
word "pride." It is not merely proud in the sense of being exultant, but
proud in the sense of being disdainful. Such outlaws are more exclusive
than aristocrats; and their anarchical arrogance goes far beyond the pride of
Milton and the aristocrats of the New Learning. And this final refinement
has completed the work which the saner aristocrats began, the work now
most evident in the world: the separation of art from the people. I need not
insist on the sensational and self-evident character of that separation. I
need not recommend the modern poet to attempt to sing his <i>vers libres</i> in a
public house. I need not even urge the young Imagist to read out a number
of his disconnected Images to a public meeting. The thing is not only
admitted but admired. The old artist remained proud in spite of his unpopularity;
the new artist is proud because of his unpopularity; perhaps it is his
chief ground for pride.</p>

<p>Dwelling as I do in the Dark Ages, or at latest among the mediæval fairy-tales,
I am yet moved to remember something I once read in a modern
fairy-tale. As it happens, I have already used the name of George Macdonald;
and in the best of his books there is a description of how a young miner in
the mountains could always drive away the subterranean goblins if he could
remember and repeat any kind of rhyme. The impromptu rhymes were often
doggerel, as was the dog-Latin of many monkish hexameters or the burden
of many rude Border ballads. But I have a notion that they drove away the
devils, blue devils of pessimism and black devils of pride. Anyhow Madame
Montessori, who has apparently been deploring the educational effects of
fairy-tales, would probably see in me a pitiable example of such early perversion,
for that image which was one of my first impressions seems likely
enough to be one of my last; and when the noise of many new and original
musical instruments, with strange shapes and still stranger noises, has passed
away like a procession, I shall hear in the succeeding silence only a rustle
and scramble among the rocks and a boy singing on the mountain.</p>

<h2>PSYCHO-ANALYSIS AND THE NOVEL</h2>

<p class="center">By J. D. BERESFORD</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IF</span> the opinion of the reviewer represents in any degree the opinion of
the public, psycho-analysis is becoming at once the craze and the curse
of the modern novelist. The chief persons of the story, we gather,
are no longer units, recognisable illustrations of acceptable and well-defined
types of character, but tend to split horribly into their component
parts, revealing the workings of their unconscious minds with a spiritual
immodesty worthy of the immortal Sally Beauchamp. Our heroes suffer
from "Œdipus complexes" with a unanimity that must appear altogether
perverse to a generation reared on the works of Charles Dickens, who
consistently regarded all mothers as criminal, negligible, or insane. Our
heroines are become either displayed specimens of morbid pathology or
increasingly middle-aged. Finally, and as a culminating horror, we occasionally
come across a novel written with such a single regard for the subjective
emotions that the objective personality appears only now and then as an
uncompleted cast momentarily lifted, for examination, from the matrix.</p>

<p>Moreover, these symptoms and their like&mdash;I still adapt and condense the
current opinions of the outraged reviewer&mdash;exhibit an inclination to multiply.
We picture the admirer of the world's most successful novelist (Harold Bell
Wright) as arching his back and spitting furiously at the first indication of
a Freudian thesis. And, to conclude the indictment, it is plain that unless
the novel-writing disciples of the Vienna and Zurich schools of psychology
can promptly be bled to death&mdash;they have, thank God, quite miserable
circulations!&mdash;their influence may permeate and vitiate that sane and admirable
method which has given us an Ethel M. Dell, a Temple Thurston, or
a Zane Grey.</p>

<p>This indictment represents, no doubt, an extremist attitude, the opinion
of that multitude which must have its heroines pure and its morality
undiluted; but it cannot be neglected solely on that account. And when we
recognise, as we must, that authentic critics have also shown a bias in the
same direction, we have established a case that demands both a literary and
a scientific consideration.</p>

<p>Our analysis, however, must begin with certain exclusions. If we are to
test the influence of psycho-analysis on the novel as an art-form we must
take into account not only the effect, but also the manner of the incidence.
For it is manifest that of all theories of the nature of man ever put forward by
a reputable scientist, that of Sigmund Freud is the most attractive and
adaptable for the purposes of fiction. It was a theory of sex, the all but
universal theme of the novel; it emphasised various peculiarities of thought,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
feeling, and action that no observant, and, <i>a fortiori</i>, no introspective
novelist could thereafter overlook; it gave a new mystery to the human
mind; adumbrated the suggestion of a freer morality by dwelling upon the
physical and spiritual necessity for the liberation of impulse; and, last
temptation of the enervated seeker for new themes, provided material for
comparatively unworked complications of motive.</p>

<p>Now, these appeals have inevitably influenced the writing of just those
experimenters and opportunists whose novels I wish to exclude from our
analysis. Their productions can only be indicative of a passing fashion;
their value, at best, such as the future historian may find in the record of the
epidemic symptoms they have documented. But since novels of this type
have a particular significance, both in relation to our present purpose and to
all literary criticism of this form of expression, we must in the first place
arrive at a clear understanding of the quality that differentiates them from
those other works which, whatever their failings, have another representative
value.</p>

<p>Taking, then, an extreme and therefore ideal example, I submit that the
essential difference is that between pure observation and pure feeling, or
variously between an intellectual as opposed to an emotional response to
experience. In the case of the experimenters we are considering, such a
subject as psycho-analysis is studied from the surface, the facts and general
teachings are memorised and then applied, more or less arbitrarily, to the
invented or observed characters who figure in the story. Such a method
when brilliantly used may produce an impression of truth, may even in rare
cases lead to discovery, but in its essence it is mechanical, a mere collection
and presentation of material that has not been assimilated, and hence very
slightly transmuted by the writer.</p>

<p>The opposed example is that in which the study of, say, psycho-analysis
comes to the understanding of the writer as a formula that interprets for him
a mode of experience. He has, let us assume, been aware of and puzzled by a
habit of thought or feeling which is suddenly and beautifully illuminated
for him by the application of this new formula. Nor, in the truly representative
instance, does the process halt at the first discovery, but continues to
open resolutions of old difficulties hardly recognised as such until they fall
within the scope of the new criterion. The danger that besets the young
disciple in the first ecstasies of such an adventure is that he will inevitably
be tempted to apply his touchstone too generally, to imagine that his formula
will explain all life.</p>

<p>In such a case as this the manner of incidence, to which I referred, differs
markedly from the first example. Here we get a sense of interpenetration and
subsequent assimilation, in the former case rather of obliquity and reflection;
the true difference being that one writer finds in psycho-analysis an aid to the
understanding of human thought and action, the other merely a useful piece
to add to his repertoire. And, finally in this connection, one has true value
as evidence of the validity of the theory; the other has not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
Having thus cleared the ground by eliminating more particularly those
literary experiments in applied psychology that have had such an irritant
action on the nerves of the reviewer, I propose to test the applicability of
psycho-analysis to fiction by a brief examination of certain aspects of the
work of a writer who had not heard of Freud and never attempted to
anticipate his method. Dostoevsky, in fact, from our point of view, may be
regarded primarily as a patient rather than as a doctor.</p>

<p>Of his life up to the age of seven years we lack that information which
would provide us with the last triumphant detail of proof. It is exceedingly
improbable that that detail will ever be forthcoming. But it is a fairly safe
inference from the later evidence that at some time in the course of those
earlier years he suffered either some shock of terror or stress of misery that
initiated the trauma which was later confirmed and emphasised by his
experience on the scaffold. This inference is inherently probable, and since
it might conceivably be confirmed by research and could not conceivably be
disproved, we may assume it as a premise, although it is not absolutely
essential pathologically.</p>

<p>For the remainder of his life we see him beyond all shadow of doubt
suffering from a neurosis that, even if it were not the cause, was the accompaniment
and not the result of his epilepsy. The form taken by this neurosis
has been provisionally termed an "inferiority complex." In its milder and
practically harmless forms it is perhaps the commonest instance of a morbid
inhibition, despite the fact that&mdash;<i>pace</i> Dr. Freud&mdash;it depends more on the
power principle of Adler than on the pleasure-pain principle so tediously
insisted upon by the Vienna school. The symptoms in aggravated cases
exhibit on the one side an exaggerated humility, and on the other an intolerant
use of any adventitious opportunity for the use of power. Two instances of
everyday experience taken from a text-book of psycho-analysis are: The
driver of a heavy van brutally threatening the temporarily inferior pedestrian
by the threat of running him down; and the ordinarily meek woman who
takes a delight in exerting temporary superiority of position, it may be in
such a trivial act as keeping anyone waiting by a pretence of inattention.</p>

<p>Dostoevsky, however, has himself analysed the condition so perfectly
that his study might well find a place in a medical library as the ideal type
of this particular neurosis. The supposed autobiographer (his name does not
appear) in <i>Notes from Underground</i><a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> is, perhaps, too intelligently aware
of his own condition, but it is evident that Dostoevsky's purpose could only be
fully served by the form of a personal confession. It is, indeed, a confession
that holds no reserves. In the earlier part of the story we see the assumed
writer of the notes suffering agonies from the consciousness of his humiliation.
This is followed by two attempts to assert himself, both futile. We then
see him in a contest with his servant, Apollon, whose condition is a reflex of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
his own. And, finally, we get the representative instance of a brutal use of
temporary superiority of position in his dealings with the unfortunate little
prostitute, Liza. Moreover, the title is conclusive. The "underground" is
clearly indicated as that of the mind, and if the story had been written
within the last ten years the author would have been accused by the reviewers
of having steeped himself in the writings of the psycho-analysts. The opening
sentences, indeed, would probably have been a little too much for the
sensitive, since the sketch begins: "I am a sick man ... I am a
spiteful man. I am an unattractive man. I believe my liver is diseased.
However, I know nothing at all about my disease, and do not know for
certain what ails me."</p>

Garnett's translations. Heinemann.</p></div>

<p>This one story would be almost sufficient testimony as to Dostoevsky's
own condition, the essential part of it coming, as it does, not from observation,
but from the "underground" of the writer's own mind. But if we need
further evidence it can be found in almost any of Dostoevsky's novels:
the valet in <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> is a fine example; Prince Myshkin in
<i>The Idiot</i> develops the theme in its less self-conscious aspect; there is more
than one example in <i>The Possessed</i>. But the truth is that, once started on this
scent, the student of Dostoevsky cannot fail to conclude that the type
dominates both the characterisation and the atmosphere of all his works.</p>

<p>Yet if our diagnosis rested solely on this evidence the inference would be
open to attack by the layman on the grounds that Dostoevsky wrote of the
Russian as he knew him; and has not Russia as a country exhibited precisely
the symptoms of the neurosis we have been describing? Centuries of suppression
and humiliation have been at work to foster and confirm the complex
which we now see in its typical expression, although passing, as did that of
the French in the last years of the eighteenth century, towards its natural
sublimation.</p>

<p>But our evidence goes beyond the examination of Dostoevsky's imaginative
writings&mdash;in which, by the way, he was continually able, within certain
limitations, to sublimate his own complex. Indeed, it was not by his novels
but by a study of his letters that I, personally, was led in the first instance to
attempt the diagnosis. In the letters we must look chiefly for autobiographical
indications rather than for the emergence of the unconscious wisdom that
enriches the novels, but would be checked by the realisation of addressing
a particular individual.</p>

<p>The first of them that attracted my attention was the adulatory tone of
the letters begging for patronage, written just before the release from Siberia.
One regrets, in reading them, that genius could so bemean itself. The
common excuse for the tone of them is that Dostoevsky was ill and over-tried
by his recent experiences, but it is just in such circumstances as these
that one looks for the expression of the dominant individuality. In any case
I prefer the pathological explanation. Then we come to the consideration of
his jealousy of Turgenev, and of the unfortunate meeting of the two men in
Switzerland. All Dostoevsky's resentment and his behaviour at the meeting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
in question are readily explicable by the theory of his neurosis, but the need
for impartiality demands that we should ask if a perfectly normal explanation
is forthcoming. Personally I have failed to find one that is consistent with an
unprejudiced interpretation of Dostoevsky's general character. Apart from
his prepossession, he exhibits traits of gentleness, affection, and tolerance
that do not appear to me consonant with his treatment of Turgenev. He did
not seek to belittle his other contemporaries. But, in this instance, like the
hero of <i>Notes from Underground</i>, he could not resist the unconscious desire
to try and jostle his superior from the <span class="locked">pavement.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span></p>

<p>For our present purpose, however, it is not necessary to prove that
Dostoevsky himself was the victim of a particular neurosis&mdash;although the
argument is slightly strengthened if that hypothesis be admitted&mdash;since it
is primarily only my intention to show that certain morbid conditions of
mind, now clearly indicated and with obvious limitations explained by the
psycho-analysts, may be artistically treated in the best fiction. Another
instance of this, which may be briefly referred to, is that afforded by the
writings of D. H. Lawrence, who in all his novels has demonstrated with the
passionate conviction that is a witness to his genius the strange and
occasionally dissociated workings of the unconscious mind. In this case we
are confronted with just such a sex obsession as delights the faithful disciples
of the Vienna school, but the particular type of complex is not of any importance
in this connection.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The result of our preliminary examination may be summarised as the
posing of two deductions: the first, that the deliberate, intellectual use in
the pages of a novel of the teachings of psycho-analysis produces an effect
upon the reader that may be variously irritating, unconvincing, and
negligible, but is rarely, if ever, psychologically valuable; the second, that a
writer of genius such as Dostoevsky has, in one sense, forestalled the
conclusions of this branch of psychology and used them to the benefit of
literature. At first sight these two deductions may appear to disclose an
inherent contradiction, namely, that the theories of psycho-analysis can and
cannot be used for the purposes of fiction; but this apparent contradiction is
instantly resolved by a consideration of the manner of treatment. Briefly we
may assume that, according to precedent, a true form of self-expression
must bear the impress of spontaneity, and hence that a novelist's learning
is comparatively valueless to him until it has been so assimilated and
transmuted as to become a personal experience and conviction.</p>

<p>This last proposition, however, opens the second phase of our thesis,
presenting as it does the obvious deduction that such a theory as that of
psycho-analysis properly comprehended and applied may become a powerful
influence in the novel of the future. But to decide that we must consider,
first, how far the theory is a new one, and, secondly, in what respects it
illuminates the problems of normal psychology.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
The answer to the first question can be stated quite briefly. The knowledge
of the facts upon which Freud's pathological method was founded are as
old as folk-lore. Certain symbols that the modern practitioner recognises as
having a peculiar significance in the dreams of his patient are the same
symbols that were used not only in Greek and Norse mythologies, but also
in the most primitive rites of the savage. What is new is primarily the
pathological method by which the unconscious mind may be induced to
reveal its dangerous secrets; but from the study of this method there is
arising the outline of a new psychology for which we have no true precedent.
Glimmerings and faint foreshadowings there may have been, but no sure
recognition or understanding; and the answer to our second question
involves some inquiry into what this new psychology implies.</p>

<p>Let me begin by saying that psycho-analysis throws very little light on the
problem of the survival of the personality, and Dr. Jung, in his address to
the Society for Psychical Research last April, refused to admit the probability
of any authentic message having been received from departed spirits. We
are able, therefore, to confine ourselves strictly to the study of humanity in
its normal, that is to say, in its terrestrial, condition, and find our main point
of convergence from older psychologies in the intensive observation of that
element of our make-up which is now commonly spoken of as "the
unconscious."</p>

<p>A scholarly history designed to collate the main facts of man's attitude
towards and tentative realisations of his own duality would make uncommonly
interesting reading; but outside religion and imaginative literature no
real attempt was made to <i>characterise</i> the unconscious mind until Freud
began to practise a pathology that relied upon the interpretation of dreams
as an essential part of the method of diagnosis. In the past the oneirocritic
was solely concerned with the significance of the dream in so far as it foretold
the future; the Freudian analysis, before Jung restored the balance
of factors, was equally single-minded in relating it to the past. And this
change of attitude&mdash;so startling in its implications that it almost makes a
break in the continuity of thought&mdash;tended very quickly to crystallise a
host of speculations that had awaited a unifying hypothesis. For this method
of interpreting the dream, supported as it was by verifiable results in the
patient's nervous, mental, and physical condition, could only signify that
we are endowed with a double consciousness, and that under a suitable
stimulus the deeper consciousness could be examined and, as I have said,
characterised. We are, in short, confronted with the theorem of a dual
<span class="locked">personality<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> in every human being, in which the second person has peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>
and essential functions, both in connection with our sanity and with our
physical well-being. What precisely is the scope of these functions we are not
yet in a position to say, but we can formulate with reasonable certainty
various characteristic activities, tendencies and modes of expression, common
to this second personality, that are of the greatest importance to modern
psychology.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24" id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> In using the term "dual personality" I beg an essential question for the sake of a convenient
image; but it must not be assumed that what I describe hereafter as a second personality
is recognised as such by psychologists. It is possible that the unconscious bears some such
relation to the conscious as desire bears to purpose, instinct to reason, or reflexive to deliberative
action. But see also in this connection <i>De l'Inconscient au Conscient</i>, by Dr. Gustave Geley,
Paris. 1919.</p></div>

<p>We must, for example, face the deduction that the unconscious can suffer
from a queer and hitherto unrecognised form of ill-health. A sudden fright,
for instance, more particularly in childhood, has apparently the effect of
breaking the liaison in this one particular relation between the conscious and
the unconscious minds. The shock itself, whatever it may be, is not remembered
by the conscious mind, and this failure of contact between the unconscious
and objective reality seems to produce a condition comparable to
nervous worry. Speaking figuratively, one may say that the second personality
becomes the victim of a growing obsession, and begins to concentrate
its efforts more and more upon signalling its message of distress. And surely
the strangest of all the strange facts that have recently been described
concerning this amazing partnership of ours is that the second personality
cannot communicate with the first except in the language of symbol. The
means by which that vital message can be transmitted is, generally, in the
first instance by a dream. But this dream does not picture the actual circumstances
of the original shock, but seeks to describe it by a method that
Dr. Maurice Nicoll has compared to that of the political cartoon. Night
after night the message of distress is delivered with diligent ingenuity in a
picture language the images of which are frequently taken from casual and
unimportant experiences of the dreamer's waking life, such experiences being
presented in the form of an allegory which, rightly interpreted, has a bearing
on the urgent cause of distress. When this mode of communication fails,
more drastic steps are taken and the physical actions of the body may be
influenced in the form of a mania. A youth or a young woman shocked by a
sudden sexual experience or revelation to the point of conscious forgetfulness
of the incident in question may develop a mania for the continued
cleansing of the hands&mdash;again, be it noted, the message being conveyed by a
symbol. Or the effect may be the development of a phobia that in extreme
cases may cause the death of the patient.</p>

<p>Now, the points of immediate interest in this amazing process are, firstly,
what may be called the anxiety of the unconscious to communicate its
distress; and, secondly, the inability to convey its message by any means
other than that of symbol. From the former observation it may perhaps be
inferred, <i>inter alia</i>, that it is vital to the functions of the unconscious that it
should have universal touch with the objective realities of its partner; from
the second, that the existence of a trauma causing a breach between the two
minds is of such a nature that direct communication becomes impossible
along that particular circuit. For, although it is true that the majority of
dreams emerge in this form, they also contain now and then plain statements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
that solve a perplexity; and it is difficult to understand why in cases of such
vital urgency, an image of the conditions responsible for the original trauma
should not be directly presented, unless there is some nervous dissociation&mdash;it
may be an actual physical displacement or temporary rearrangement of
cell tissue&mdash;producing a restricted amnesia in the conscious mind.</p>

<p>Proceeding now with the characterisation of the unconscious, we come
to that aspect of it which has above all others tickled and excited the popular
imagination. In this aspect the unconscious figures as the crouching beast
of desire, the primitive immoral instigator of all the animal passions, a thing
of wonderful abilities and capable of amazing physical dexterities, but before
all else unethical and uncivilised. But sorry as I am to destroy so romantic
and intriguing a creation, I must admit that Dr. Jung's researches do not
uphold this view of the unconscious as a universal type. It is, indeed, well
established in the mythologies and appears as the serpent, a favourite
symbol, in the second chapter of Genesis; but the individual may at once
put away the fear, or the hope, that he himself is harbouring so fearful a
beast. For, if we may argue from those abnormal instances that furnish the
bolder illustrations of tendency, we have excellent grounds for following
Jung in the assumption that the unconscious is the complement of the
conscious. Is a man brutal, then he is suppressing the urgency to gentleness
that wells up&mdash;an uncertain and impeded flow, no doubt&mdash;from the depths
of his being; and we remember the callous murderer exhibiting a tender
solicitude for some feeble animal. Is he a miser, he is occasionally tortured
by promptings to an absurd generosity. Is he a loose-liver, he suffers from
an unappeasable longing after chastity. The saint is tempted by his unconscious
being to sin: the sinner to renounce the devil and all his works. In
short, the character of the unconscious is as various as the character of man;
although in this civilised world of ours, in which the dominant restrictions
of society are in the direction of sex and decency, we are naturally inclined
towards a generalisation that presents the unconscious as a creature of
immodesty and lust....</p>

<p>But it is unnecessary for the purposes of this article that I should elaborate
any further the larger inferences of the psycho-analysts with regard to the
personal traits, influences, and functions of this astonishing partner of ours.
All that I wish to demonstrate is that such a partner almost certainly exists
and has an immense influence upon our impulses, our thoughts, and our
actions. And the critical question we have to face is whether the agency of
the unconscious, recognised now both by the philosophers and the psychologists,
can possibly be kept out of the novel. Personally, I believe that
neither the distaste of the reviewer nor that more influential factor the
distaste of the public will avail to bar the conclusions of psycho-analysis
from the fiction of the future. We are coming inevitably to a new test in our
judgments upon human action and thought, a test that has been proved to
be valid by many thousands of well-authenticated experiments. I am willing
to admit that through all the ages genius has anticipated laboratory and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
clinical methods, and that the basis of the psycho-analytical theory was
firmly established in literature before Freud applied it as a pathological
method. But once such a theory as this is established&mdash;a probability one
can hardly escape&mdash;how can any serious novelist afford to neglect the
illumination it throws upon the subtle problems of human impulse? Is it
not already tending to become a touchstone of the author's powers of
observation and understanding, helping us to evaluate the intellectual productions
of the writer, whether realist or romantic, who relies upon the evidence
of his eyes and ears rather than upon his personal emotions and experience?</p>

<p>I am aware that such a postulate as this contradicts in some respects
certain implications I have previously made. But it must be remembered
that while the novelist's best material undoubtedly comes from his personal
contacts, almost infinitely extended by his powers of entering with an
emotional sympathy into the experiences of other lives either presented or
recounted, he cannot entirely neglect the precedents afforded by learning.
Such precedents may only serve him as a test and a formula for correction,
but should he overlook them altogether he will be liable to fall into the
error of regarding his personal equation as a universal standard and
generalise from the atypical.</p>

<p>And, finally, I would submit that we are at this moment passing through
a new phase of evolution that must have a characteristic effect on the fiction
of the future&mdash;if the form of the novel survives the change. We may study
the first evidences of this strange partnership of ours in the lower animals.
In the wild what we call the unconscious appears to be the single control.
It represents the genius of instinct, swift, feral, and unethical. In animals,
such as the dog and the horse, age-long companions of man, we can trace
the incipient rivalry of what in ourselves we regard as the representative
consciousness. The horse and the dog have already learnt the meaning of
conscious inhibition. At our command they can deny the spontaneous
impulses of their natural desire. In civilised man that ability has been
cultivated until he is able to present to the world and himself so complete an
entity that we and he regard it as his proper expression. But, meanwhile,
we cannot now doubt that his hidden partner has evolved with him. The
impulses of the unconscious are no longer simply feral and animal. We are,
a trifle unwillingly, coming to the conclusion that it is this other shadowed
self that is responsible for all that is best and most permanent in literature.
It is being associated with genius on the one hand, and on the other with the
highest dexterity in games of skill. And is it not possible that with our
growing realisation of this co-operation the "education of the subconscious"&mdash;as
Varisco, the Italian philosopher, calls it&mdash;will proceed ever
more rapidly? And to what end, unless it be that in the strange process of
our earthly evolution this artificial shell of the conscious will be gradually
broken and absorbed to reveal the single and relatively perfect individual
that has been so steadily developing underground?</p>

<h2>JOHN DONNE</h2>

<p class="center">By ROBERT LYND</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IZAAK</span> Walton in his short life of Donne has painted a figure
of almost seraphic beauty. When Donne was but a boy, he declares,
it was said that the age had brought forth another Pico della
Mirandola. As a young man in his twenties, he was a prince among
lovers, who by his secret marriage with his patron's niece&mdash;"for love,"
says Walton, "is a flattering mischief"&mdash;purchased at first only the ruin
of his hopes and a term in prison. Finally, we have the later Donne in the
pulpit of St. Paul's represented, in a beautiful adaptation of one of his own
images, as "always preaching to himself, like an angel from a cloud, though
in none; carrying some, as St. Paul was, to Heaven in holy raptures, and
enticing others by a sacred art and courtship to amend their lives." The
picture is all of noble charm. Walton speaks in one place of "his winning
behaviour&mdash;which, when it would entice, had a strange kind of elegant
irresistible art." There are no harsh phrases even in the references to those
irregularities of Donne's youth, by which he had wasted the fortune of
£3000&mdash;equal, I believe, to more than £30,000 of our money&mdash;bequeathed
to him by his father, the ironmonger. "Mr. Donne's estate," writes Walton
gently, referring to his penury at the time of his marriage, "was the greatest
part spent in many and chargeable travels, books, and dear-bought experience."
It is true that he quotes Donne's own confession of the irregularities
of his early life. But he counts them of no significance. He also utters a sober
reproof of Donne's secret marriage as "the remarkable error of his life."
But how little he condemned it in his heart is clear when he goes on to tell us
that God blessed Donne and his wife "with so mutual and cordial affections,
as in the midst of their sufferings made their bread of sorrow taste more
pleasantly than the banquets of dull and low-spirited people." It was not
for Walton to go in search of small blemishes in him whom he regarded as
the wonder of the world&mdash;him whose grave mournful friends "strewed ...
with an abundance of curious and costly flowers," as Alexander the Great
strewed the grave of "the famous Achilles." In that grave there was buried
for Walton a whole age magnificent with wit, passion, adventure, piety, and
beauty. More than that, the burial of Donne was for him the burial of an
inimitable Christian. He mourns over "that body, which once was a
Temple of the Holy Ghost, and is now become a small quantity of Christian
dust," and, as he mourns, he breaks off with the fervent prophecy, "But I
shall see it re-animated." That is his valediction. If Donne is esteemed three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
hundred years after his death less as a great Christian than as a great pagan,
this is because we now look for him in his writings rather than in his
biography, in his poetry rather than in his prose, and in his <i>Songs and Sonnets</i>
and <i>Elegies</i> rather than in his <i>Divine Poems</i>. We find, in some of these,
abundant evidence of the existence of a dark angel at odds with the good
angel of Walton's raptures. Donne suffered in his youth all the temptations
of Faust. His thirst was not for salvation but for experience&mdash;experience of
the intellect and experience of sensation. He has left it on record in one of
his letters that he was a victim at one period of "the worst voluptuousness,
an hydroptic immoderate desire of human learning and languages." Faust
in his cell can hardly have been a more insatiate student than Donne. "In
the most unsettled days of his youth," Walton tells us, "his bed was not
able to detain him beyond the hour of four in the morning; and it was no
common business that drew him out of his chamber till past ten; all which
time was employed in study; though he took great liberty after it." His
thoroughness of study may be judged from the fact that "he left the resultance
of 1400 authors, most of them abridged and analysed with his own
hand." But we need not go beyond his poems for proof of the wilderness of
learning that he had made his own. He was versed in medicine and the law
as well as in theology. He subdued astronomy, physiology, and geography
to the needs of poetry. Nine Muses were not enough for him, even though
they included Urania. He called in to their aid Galen and Copernicus. He
did not go to the hills and the springs for his images, but to the laboratory
and the library, and in the library the books that he consulted to the greatest
effect were the works of men of science and learning, not of the great poets
with whom London may almost be said to have been peopled during his lifetime.
I do not think his verse or correspondence contains a single reference
to Shakespeare, whose contemporary he was, being born only nine years
later. The only great Elizabethan poet whom he seems to have regarded with
interest and even friendship was Ben Jonson. Jonson's Catholicism may
have been a link between them. But, more important than that, Jonson was,
like Donne himself, an inflamed pedant. For each of them learning was the
necessary robe of genius. Jonson, it is true, was a pedant of the classics,
Donne of the speculative sciences; but both of them alike ate to a surfeit of the
fruit of the tree of knowledge. It was, I think, because Donne was to so great
a degree a pagan of the Renaissance, loving the proud things of the intellect
more than the treasures of the humble, that he found it easy to abandon
the Catholicism of his family for Protestantism. He undoubtedly became in
later life a convinced and passionate Christian of the Protestant faith, but
at the time when he first changed his religion he had none of the fanaticism
of the pious convert. He wrote in an early satire as a man whom the intellect
had liberated from dogma-worship. Nor did he ever lose this rationalist
tolerance. "You know," he once wrote to a friend, "I have never
imprisoned the word religion.... They" (the churches) "are all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
virtual beams of one sun." Few converts in those days of the wars of religion
wrote with such wise reason of the creeds as did Donne in the lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To adore or scorn an image, or protest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May all be bad; doubt wisely; in strange way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stand inquiring right, is not to stray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sleep or run wrong is. On a huge hill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cragged and steep, Truth stands, and he that will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reach her, about must and about must go;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what the hill's suddenness resists, win so.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">This surely was the heresy of an inquisitive mind, not the mood of a theologian.
It betrays a tolerance springing from ardent doubt, not from ardent
faith.</p>

<p>It is all in keeping with one's impression of the young Donne as a man
setting out bravely in his cockle-shell on the oceans of knowledge and
experience. He travels, though he knows not why he travels. He loves, though
he knows not why he loves. He must escape from that "hydroptic immoderate"
thirst of experience by yielding to it. One fancies that it was in this
spirit that he joined the expedition of Essex to Cadiz in 1596 and afterwards
sailed to the Azores. Or partly in this spirit, for he himself leads one to think
that his love-affairs may have had something to do with it. In the second of
those prematurely realistic descriptions of storm and calm relating to the
Azores voyage, he writes:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whether a rotten state, and hope of gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to disuse me from the queasy pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of being belov'd, and loving, or the thirst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of honour, or fair death, out pusht me first.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In these lines we get a glimpse of the Donne that has attracted most
interest in recent years&mdash;the Donne who experienced more variously than
any other poet of his time "the queasy pain of being beloved and loving."
Donne was curious of adventures of many kinds, but in nothing more than
in love. As a youth he leaves the impression of having been an Odysseus of
love, a man of many wiles and many travels. He was a virile neurotic, comparable
in some points to Baudelaire, who was a sensualist of the mind
even more than of the body. His sensibilities were different as well as less
of a piece, but he had something of Baudelaire's taste for hideous and
shocking aspects of lust. One is not surprised to find among his poems that
"heroical epistle of Sappho to Philaenis," in which he makes himself the
casuist of forbidden things. His studies of sensuality, however, are for the
most part normal, even in their grossness. There was in him more of the
Yahoo than of the decadent. There was an excremental element in his genius
as in the genius of that other gloomy dean, Jonathan Swift. Donne and
Swift were alike satirists born under Saturn. They laughed more frequently
from disillusion than from happiness. Donne, it must be admitted, turned
his disillusion to charming as well as hideous uses. <i>Go and Catch a Falling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
Star</i> is but one of a series of delightful lyrics in disparagement of women.
In several of the <i>Elegies</i>, however, he throws away his lute and comes to the
satirist's more prosaic business. He writes frankly as a man in search of
bodily experiences:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whoever loves, if he do not propose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The right true end of love, he's one that goes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sea for nothing but to make him sick.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">In <i>Love's Progress</i> he lets his fancy dwell on the detailed geography of a
woman's body, with the sick imagination of a schoolboy, till the beautiful
seems almost beastly. In <i>The Anagram</i> and <i>The Comparison</i> he plays the
Yahoo at the expense of all women by the similes he uses in insulting two
of them. In <i>The Perfume</i> he relates the story of an intrigue with a girl whose
father discovered his presence in the house as a result of his using scent.
Donne's jest about it is suggestive of his uncontrollable passion for ugliness:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Had it been some bad smell, he would have thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That his own feet, or breath, that smell had brought.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It may be contended that in <i>The Perfume</i> he was describing an imaginary
experience, and indeed we have his own words on record: "I did best when
I had least truth for my subjects." But even if we did not accept Mr. Gosse's
common-sense explanation of these words, we should feel that the details
of the story have a vividness that springs straight from reality. It is difficult
to believe that Donne had not actually lived in terror of the gigantic manservant
who was set to spy on the lovers.</p>

<p>But the most interesting of all the sensual intrigues of Donne, from the point
of view of biography, especially since Mr. Gosse gave it such commanding
significance in that <i>Life of John Donne</i> in which he made a living man out
of a mummy, is that of which we have the story in <i>Jealousy</i> and <i>His Parting
from Her</i>. It is another story of furtive and forbidden love. Its theme is an
intrigue carried on under a</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">Husband's towering eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flamed with oily sweat of jealousy.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">A characteristic touch of grimness is added to the story by making the
husband a deformed man. Donne, however, merely laughs at his deformity,
as he bids the lady laugh at the jealousy that reduces her to tears:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O give him many thanks, he is courteous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in suspecting kindly warneth us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We must not, as we used, flout openly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In scoffing riddles, his deformity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor at his board together being set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With words nor touch, scarce looks adulterate.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">And he proposes that, now that the husband seems to have discovered them
they shall henceforth carry on their intrigue at some distance from where</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">He, swol'n and pampered with great fare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sits down and snorts, cag'd in his basket chair.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It is an extraordinary story, if it is true. It throws a scarcely less extraordinary
light on the nature of Donne's mind, if he invented it. At the same time, I
do not think the events it relates played the important part which Mr.
Gosse assigns to them in Donne's spiritual biography. It is impossible to read
Mr. Gosse's two volumes without getting the impression that "the deplorable
but eventful liaison," as he calls it, was the most fruitful occurrence in
Donne's life as a poet. He discovers traces of it in one great poem after
another&mdash;even in the <i>Nocturnal upon St. Lucy's Day</i>, which is commonly
supposed to relate to the Countess of Bedford, and in <i>The Funeral</i>, the theme
of which Professor Grierson takes to be the mother of George Herbert. I
confess that the oftener I read the poetry of Donne the more firmly I
become convinced that, far from being primarily the poet of desire gratified
and satiated, he is essentially the poet of frustrated love. He is often described
by the historians of literature as the poet who finally broke down the tradition
of Platonic love. I believe that, so far is this from being the case, he is the
supreme example of a Platonic lover among the English poets. He was
usually Platonic under protest, but at other times exultantly so. Whether he
finally overcame the more consistent Platonism of his mistress by the impassioned
logic of <i>The Ecstasy</i> we have no means of knowing. If he did, it would
be difficult to resist the conclusion that the lady who wished to continue
to be his passionate friend and to ignore the physical side of love was Anne
More, whom he afterwards married. If not, we may look for her where we
will, whether in Magdalen Herbert (already a young widow who had borne
ten children when he first met her) or in the Countess of Bedford or in
another. The name is not important, and one is not concerned to know it,
especially when one remembers Donne's alarming curse on:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whoever guesses, thinks, or dreams he knows<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Who is my mistress.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">One sort of readers will go on speculating, hoping to discover real people in
the shadows, as they speculate about Swift's Stella and Vanessa, and his
relations to them. It is enough for us to feel, however, that these poems
railing at or glorying in Platonic love are no mere goldsmith's compliments,
like the rhymed letters to Mrs. Herbert and Lady Bedford. Miracles of this
sort are not wrought save by the heart. We do not find in them the underground
and sardonic element that appears in so much of Donne's merely
amorous work. We no longer picture him as a sort of Vulcan hammering
out the poetry of base love, raucous, powerful, mocking. He becomes in
them a child of Apollo, as far as his temperament will allow him. He makes
music of so grave and stately a beauty that one begins to wonder at all the
critics who have found fault with his rhythms&mdash;from Ben Jonson, who said
that "for not keeping accent, Donne deserved hanging," down to Coleridge,
who declared that his "muse on dromedary trots," and described him as
"rhyme's sturdy cripple." Coleridge's quatrain on Donne is, without
doubt, an unequalled masterpiece of epigrammatic criticism. But Donne<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
rode no dromedary. In his greatest poems he rides Pegasus like a master,
even if he does rather weigh the poor beast down by carrying an encyclopædia
in his saddle-bags.</p>

<p>Not only does Donne remain a learned man on his Pegasus, however:
he also remains a humorist, a serious fantastic. Humour and passion pursue
each other through the labyrinth of his being, as we find in those two
beautiful poems, <i>The Relic</i> and <i>The Funeral</i>, addressed to the lady who had
given him a bracelet of her hair. In the former he foretells what will happen
if ever his grave is broken up and his skeleton discovered with</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A bracelet of bright hair about the bone.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">People will fancy, he declares, that the bracelet is a device of lovers</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To make their souls at the last busy day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meet at the grave and make a little stay.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Bone and bracelet will be worshipped as relics&mdash;the relics of a Magdalen and
her lover. He conjectures with a quiet smile:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All women shall adore us, and some men.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">He warns his worshippers, however, that the facts are far different from what
they imagine, and tells the miracle-seekers what in reality were "the miracles
we harmless lovers wrought":</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">First we loved well and faithfully,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet knew not what we lov'd, nor why;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Difference of sex no more we knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than our guardian angels do;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Coming and going, we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance might kiss, but not between those meals;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Our hands ne'er touch'd the seals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which nature, injur'd by late law, sets free:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These miracles we did; but now, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All measure, and all language, I should pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should I tell what a miracle she was.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">In <i>The Funeral</i> he returns to the same theme:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whoever comes to shroud me do not harm<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Nor question much<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That subtle wreath of hair that crowns my arm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mystery, the sign you must not touch,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For 'tis my outward soul.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">In this poem, however, he finds less consolation than before in the too
miraculous nobleness of their love:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Whate'er she meant by it, bury it with me,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For since I am<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love's martyr, it might breed idolatry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If into other hands these relics came;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As 'twas humility<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To afford to it all that a soul can do,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">So, 'tis some bravery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, since you would have none of me, I bury some of you.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">In <i>The Blossom</i>, he is in a still more earthly mood, and declares that, if his
mistress remains obdurate, he will return to London, where he will find a
mistress:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As glad to have my body as my mind.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0"><i>The Primrose</i> is another appeal for a less intellectual love:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">Should she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be more than woman, she would get above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All thought of sex, and think to move<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My heart to study her, and not to love.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">If we turn back to <i>The Undertaking</i>, however, we find Donne boasting once
more of the miraculous purity of a love which it would be useless to communicate
to other men, since, there being no other mistress to love in the
same kind, they "would love but as before." Hence he will keep the tale a
secret:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If, as I have, you also do,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Virtue attir'd in woman see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dare love that, and say so too,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And forget the He and She;<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And if this love, though placed so,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">From profane men you hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which will no faith on this bestow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or, if they do, deride:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then you have done a braver thing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Than all the Worthies did;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a braver thence will spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Which is, to keep that hid.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It seems to me, in view of this remarkable series of poems, that it is useless
to look in Donne for a single consistent attitude to love. His poems take us
round the entire compass of love as the work of no other English poet&mdash;not
even, perhaps, Browning's&mdash;does. He was by destiny the complete
experimentalist in love in English literature. He passed through phase after
phase of the love of the body only, phase after phase of the love of the soul
only, and ended as the poet of the perfect marriage. In his youth he was a
gay&mdash;but was he ever really gay?&mdash;free-lover, who sang jestingly:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How happy were our sires in ancient times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who held plurality of loves no crime!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">By the time he writes <i>The Ecstasy</i> the victim of the body has become the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span>
protesting victim of the soul. He cries out against a love that is merely an
ecstatic friendship:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But O alas, so long, so far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our bodies why do we forbear?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">He pleads for the recognition of the body, contending that it is not the enemy
but the companion of the soul:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Soul into the soul may flow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though it to body first repair.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The realistic philosophy of love has never been set forth with greater intellectual
vehemence:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So must pure lovers' souls descend<br /></span>
<span class="i2">T' affections and to faculties,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which sense may reach and apprehend,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Else a great Prince in prison lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To our bodies turn we then, that so<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Weak men on love reveal'd may look;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love's mysteries in souls do grow<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But yet the body is the book.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">I, for one, find it impossible to believe that all this passionate verse&mdash;verse in
which we find the quintessence of Donne's genius&mdash;was a mere utterance of
abstract thoughts into the wind. Donne, as has been pointed out, was more
than most writers a poet of personal experience. His greatest poetry was
born of struggle and conflict in the obscure depths of the soul as surely as
was the religion of St. Paul. I doubt if, in the history of his genius, any event
ever happened of equal importance to his meeting with the lady who first set
going in his brain that fevered dialogue between the body and the soul.
Had he been less of a frustrated lover, less of a martyr, in whom love's</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">Art did express<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A quintessence even from nothingness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From dull privations and lean emptiness,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">much of his greatest poetry, it seems to me, would never have been written.</p>

<p>One cannot, unfortunately, write the history of the progress of Donne's
genius save by inference and guessing. His poems were not, with some
unimportant exceptions, published in his lifetime. He did not arrange them
in chronological or in any sort of order. His poem on the flea that has
bitten both him and his inamorata comes after the triumphant <i>Anniversary</i>,
and but a page or two before the <i>Nocturnal upon St. Lucy's Day</i>. Hence
there is no means of telling how far we are indebted to the Platonism of one
woman, how much to his marriage with another, for the enrichment of
his genius. Such a poem as <i>The Canonisation</i> can be interpreted either in a
Platonic sense or as a poem written to Anne More, who was to bring him
both imprisonment and the liberty of love. It is, in either case, written in
defence of his love against some who censured him for it:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For God's sake, hold your tongue, and let me love.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">In the last verses of the poem Donne proclaims that his love cannot be
measured by the standards of the vulgar:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We can die by it, if not live by love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And if unfit for tombs or hearse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our legend be, it will be fit for verse;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And, if no piece of chronicle we prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">We'll build in sonnets pretty rooms;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">As well a well-wrought urn becomes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greatest ashes as half-acre tombs,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And by these hymns all shall approve<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Us canonis'd by love:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thus invoke us: "You whom reverend love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Made one another's hermitage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You to whom love was peace, that now is rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who did the whole world's soul contract and drove<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Into the glasses of your eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i6">(So made such mirrors, and such spies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they did all to you epitomise),<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Countries, towns, courts. Beg from above<br /></span>
<span class="i6">A pattern of your love!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>According to Walton, it was to his wife that Donne addressed the beautiful
verses beginning:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweetest love, I do not go<br /></span>
<span class="i6">For weariness of thee;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">as well as the series of <i>Valedictions</i>. Of many of the other love-poems, however,
we can measure the intensity but not guess the occasion. All that we
can say with confidence when we have read them is that, after we have followed
one tributary on another leading down to the ultimate Thames of his genius,
we know that his progress as a lover was a progress from infidelity to fidelity,
from wandering amorousness to deep and enduring passion. The image that is
finally stamped on his greatest work is not that of a roving adulterer, but
of a monotheist of love. It is true that there is enough Don-Juanism in the
poems to have led even Sir Thomas Browne to think of Donne's verse rather
as a confession of his sins than as a golden book of love.</p>

<p>To the modern reader, on the contrary, it will seem that there is as much
divinity in the best of the love-poems as in the best of the religious ones.
Donne's last word as a secular poet may well be regarded as having been
uttered in that great poem in celebration of lasting love, <i>The Anniversary</i>,
which closes with so majestic a sweep:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Here upon earth we are kings, and none but we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can be such kings, nor of such subjects be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who is so safe as we, where none can do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Treason to us, except one of us two?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">True and false fears let us refrain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us love nobly, and live, and add again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Years and years unto years, till we attain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To write three-score: this is the second of our reign<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Donne's conversion as a lover was obviously as complete and revolutionary
as his conversion in religion.</p>

<p>It is said, indeed, to have led to his conversion to passionate religion.
When his marriage with Sir George More's sixteen-year-old daughter
brought him at first only imprisonment and poverty, he summed up the
sorrows of the situation in the famous line&mdash;a line which has some additional
interest as suggesting the correct pronunciation of his name:</p>

<p>
John Donne; Anne Donne; Undone.<br />
</p>

<p>His married life, however, in spite of a succession of miseries due to ill-health,
debt, and thwarted ambition, seems to have been happy beyond
prophecy; and when at the end of sixteen years his wife died in childbed,
after having borne him twelve children, a religious crisis resulted that turned
his conventional churchmanship into sanctity. His original change from
Catholicism to Protestantism has been already mentioned. Most of the
authorities are agreed, however, that this was a conversion in a formal rather
than in a spiritual sense. Even when he took Holy Orders in 1615, at the age
of forty-two, he appears to have done so less in answer to any impulse to a
religious life from within than because, with the downfall of Somerset, all
hope of advancement through his legal attainments was brought to an end.
Undoubtedly, as far back as 1612, he had thought of entering the Church.
But at the same period we find him making use of his legal knowledge in
order to help the infamous Countess of Essex to secure the annulment of
her first marriage, and at the end of 1613 he is writing an epithalamium for
the murderers of Sir Thomas Overbury. It is a curious fact that three
great poets&mdash;Donne, Ben Jonson, and Campion&mdash;appear, though innocently
enough, in the story of that sordid crime. Donne's temper at the time is
still clearly that of a man of the world. His jest at the expense of Sir Walter
Raleigh, then in the Tower, is the jest of an ungenerous worldling. Even
after his admission into the Church he reveals himself as ungenerously
morose when the Countess of Bedford, in trouble about her own extravagances,
can afford him no more than £30 to pay his debts. The truth is, to
be forty and a failure is an affliction that might sour even a healthy nature.
The effect on a man of Donne's ambitious and melancholy temperament,
together with the memory of his dissipated health and his dissipated fortune,
and the spectacle of a long family in constant process of increase, must have
been disastrous. To such a man poverty and neglected merit are a prison,
as they were to Swift. One thinks of each of them as a lion in a cage, ever
growing less and less patient of his bars. Shakespeare and Shelley had in
them some volatile element that could, one feels, have escaped through the
bars and sung above the ground. Donne and Swift were morbid men suffering
from claustrophobia. They were pent and imprisoned spirits, hating the
walls that seemed to threaten to close in on them and crush them. In his
poems and letters Donne is haunted especially by three images&mdash;the hospital,
the prison, and the grave. Disease, I think, preyed on his mind even more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
terrifyingly than warped ambition. "Put all the miseries that man is subject
to together," he exclaims in one of the passages in that luxuriant anthology
that Mr. Logan Pearsall Smith has made from the <i>Sermons</i><a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>; "sickness is
more than all.... In poverty I lack but other things; in banishment
I lack but other men; but in sickness I lack myself." Walton declares that
it was from consumption that Donne suffered; but he had probably the
seeds of many diseases. In some of his letters he dwells miserably on the
symptoms of his illnesses. At one time, his sickness "hath so much of a cramp
that it wrests the sinews, so much of a tetane that it withdraws and pulls the
mouth, and so much of the gout ... that it is not like to be cured ... I
shall," he adds, "be in this world, like a porter in a great house, but
seldomest abroad; I shall have many things to make me weary, and yet not
get leave to be gone." Even after his conversion he felt drawn to a morbid
insistence on the details of his ill-health. Those amazing records which he
wrote while lying ill in bed in October, 1623, give us a realistic study of a sickbed
and its circumstances, the gloom of which is hardly even lightened by
his odd account of the disappearance of his sense of taste: "My taste is not
gone away, but gone up to sit at David's table; my stomach is not gone,
but gone upwards toward the Supper of the Lamb." "I am mine own
ghost," he cries, "and rather affright my beholders than interest them.... Miserable
and inhuman fortune, when I must practise my lying in the grave
by lying still."</p>

Press. 6<i>s.</i> net.</p></div>

<p>It does not surprise one to learn that a man thus assailed by wretchedness
and given to looking in the mirror of his own bodily corruptions
was often tempted, by "a sickly inclination," to commit suicide, and that
he even wrote, though he did not dare to publish, an apology for suicide on
religious grounds, his famous and little-read <i>Biathanatos</i>. The family crest
of the Donnes was a sheaf of snakes, and these symbolise well enough the
brood of temptations that twisted about in this unfortunate Christian's
bosom. Donne, in the days of his salvation, abandoned the family crest
for a new one&mdash;Christ crucified on an anchor. But he might well have left
the snakes writhing about the anchor. He remained a tempted man to the
end. One wishes that the <i>Sermons</i> threw more light on his later personal
life than they do. But perhaps that is too much to expect of sermons. There
is no form of literature less personal except a leading article. The preacher
usually regards himself as a mouthpiece rather than a man giving expression
to himself. In the circumstances what surprises us is that the <i>Sermons</i> reveal,
not so little, but so much of Donne. Indeed, they make us feel far more
intimate with Donne than do his private letters, many of which are little
more than exercises in composition. As a preacher, no less than as a poet,
he is inflamed by the creative heat. He shows the same vehemence of fancy
in the presence of the divine and infernal universe&mdash;a vehemence that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
prevents even his most far-sought extravagances from disgusting us as do
the lukewarm follies of the Euphuists. Undoubtedly, the modern reader
smiles when Donne, explaining that man can be an enemy of God as the
mouse can be an enemy to the elephant, goes on to speak of "God
who is not only a multiplied elephant, millions of elephants multiplied
into one, but a multiplied world, a multiplied all, all that can be
conceived by us, infinite many times over; nay (if we may dare to say
so) a multiplied God, a God that hath the millions of the heathens' gods in
himself alone." But at the same time one finds oneself taking a serious
pleasure in the huge sorites of quips and fancies in which he loves to
present the divine argument. Nine out of ten readers of the <i>Sermons</i>, I
imagine, will be first attracted to them through love of the poems. They need
not be surprised if they do not immediately enjoy them. The dust of the
pulpit lies on them thickly enough. As one goes on reading them, however,
one becomes suddenly aware of their florid and exiled beauty. One sees
beyond their local theology to the passion of a great suffering artist. Here
are sentences that express the Paradise, the Purgatory, and the Hell of John
Donne's soul. A noble imagination is at work&mdash;a grave-digging imagination,
but also an imagination that is at home among the stars. One can open
Mr. Pearsall Smith's anthology almost at random and be sure of lighting
on a passage which gives us a characteristic movement in the symphony of
horror and hope that was Donne's contribution to the art of prose.</p>

<p>Excerpts of great prose seldom give us that rounded and final beauty that
we expect in a work of art; and the reader of Donne's <i>Sermons</i> in their latest
form will be wise if he comes to them expecting to find beauty piecemeal
and tarnished though in profusion. He will be wise, too, not to expect too
many passages of the same intimate kind as that famous confession in regard
to prayer which Mr. Pearsall Smith quotes, and which no writer on Donne
can afford not to quote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I throw myself down in my chamber, and I call in, and invite God, and his angels
thither, and when they are there, I neglect God and his Angels, for the noise of a fly,
for the rattling of a coach, for the whining of a door. I talk on, in the same posture of
praying; eyes lifted up; knees bowed down; as though I prayed to God; and, if God,
or his Angels should ask me, when I thought last of God in that prayer, I cannot
tell. Sometimes I find that I had forgot what I was about, but when I began to forget
it, I cannot tell. A memory of yesterday's pleasures, a fear of to-morrow's dangers,
a straw under my knee, a noise in mine ear, a light in mine eye, an anything, a nothing,
a fancy, a chimera in my brain, troubles me in my prayer.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">If Donne had written much prose in this kind, his <i>Sermons</i> would be as
famous as the writings of any of the saints since the days of the Apostles.</p>

<p>Even as it is, there is no other Elizabethan man of letters whose personality
is an island with a crooked shore, inviting us into a thousand bays and creeks
and rivermouths, to the same degree as the personality that expressed itself
in the poems, sermons, and life of John Donne. It is a mysterious and at
times repellent island. It lies only intermittently in the sun. A fog hangs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
around its coast, and at the base of its most radiant mountain-tops there is,
as a rule, a miasma-infested swamp. There are jewels to be found scattered
among its rocks and over its surface, and by miners in the dark. It is richer,
indeed, in jewels and precious metals and curious ornaments than in flowers.
The shepherd on the hillside seldom tells his tale uninterrupted. Strange
rites in honour of ancient infernal deities that delight in death are practised
in hidden places, and the echo of these reaches him on the sighs of the wind
and makes him shudder even as he looks at his beloved. It is an island with
a cemetery smell. The chief figure who haunts it is a living man in a
winding-sheet. It is, no doubt, Walton's story of the last days of Donne's
life that makes us, as we read even the sermons and the love-poems, so
aware of this ghostly apparition. Donne, it will be remembered, almost on
the eve of his death, dressed himself in a winding-sheet, "tied with knots at
his head and feet," and stood on a wooden urn with his eyes shut, and
"with so much of the sheet turned aside as might show his lean, pale, and
death-like face," while a painter made a sketch of him for his funeral monument.
He then had the picture placed at his bedside, to which he summoned
his friends and servants in order to bid them farewell. As he lay awaiting
death, he said characteristically, "I were miserable if I might not die," and
then repeatedly, in a faint voice, "Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done."
At the very end he lost his speech, and "as his soul ascended and his last
breath departed from him he closed his eyes, and then disposed his hands
and body into such a posture as required not the least alteration by those
that came to shroud him." It was a strange chance that preserved his spectral
monument almost uninjured when St. Paul's was burned down in the Great
Fire, and no other monument in the Cathedral escaped. Among all his
fantasies none remains in the imagination more despotically than this last
fanciful game of dying. Donne, however, remained in all respects a fantastic
to the last, as we may see in that hymn which he wrote eight days before
the end, tricked out with queer geography, and so anciently egoistic amid
its worship.</p>

<p>Donne was the poet-geographer of himself, his mistresses, and his God.
Other poets of his time dived deeper and soared to greater altitudes, but
none travelled so far, so curiously, and in such out-of-the-way places, now
hurrying like a nervous fugitive, and now in the exultation of the first man
in a new found land.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_NOVELS_OF" id="THE_NOVELS_OF">THE NOVELS OF
MR. COMPTON MACKENZIE</a></h2>

<p class="center">By JOHN FREEMAN</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">WISE</span> men have foretold the death of imaginative literature. Spider-like,
science will seize the body of this gilded fly, stab it methodically
into numbness, and then, feeding upon its vitals, will
exhaust and destroy the useless thing. With sedulous precision
the scientist will do what the artist, alas, has failed to do more than vaguely
and uncertainly: he will re-interpret life, he will rediscover man's relation
to a vaster Universe. Ignoring or spurning all attempts at the æsthetic
apprehension of the significance of life and time, he will at length announce
his own positive formula by which all phenomena and all relations must be
valued. It is the scientist who will feel and communicate, with a dry ecstasy
wholly his own, the isolation of man amid the meanness or the majesty of
the world. That language which we yet speak, stiff with ancestral associations,
will be discarded; obscure symbols, their order intelligible perhaps to
another scientist but to no one else, will be used to express the secrets of life
and riddles of death Thebes never knew. The watcher of the skies will be
no Keats: back to his galley-pots will every Keats be driven. In the midst
of that web called science the spider will sit with vigilant eyes, holding
their cunning in momentary suspense, swelling with vaster and vaster
accumulations.</p>

<p>It is not poetry alone that is threatened: imaginative art is not confined
to poetry. The strange thing is that when Thomas Hardy has carried an
imaginative view of life to a finer expression than that of any artist of his
time, and shown how easily prose may wear the strict shackles of scientific
precision, that prose itself should find no younger masters ready to use and
develop it; as if Hardy's forsaking of prose for verse were no simple forsaking,
but rather a subtle betrayal. Unique success is his in combining the
imaginative with the scientific, the emotional with the rational, in his novels;
his younger contemporaries seem to have failed equally in both directions.</p>

<p>It would be absurd to charge this dereliction to any single novelist or group
of novelists. Mr. Conrad, for instance, simply evades the charge by being in
his turn unique; Mr. Wells and Mr. Arnold Bennett fail in varying degrees
but in both directions, and of their fellows it is hard to think of any who has
not similarly failed. Where gifts are eminent the failure is eminent: hence
this preface to remarks upon the novels of Mr. Compton Mackenzie.
Diligent, observant, experienced, inexhaustible, or at any rate unexhausted,
he has made his opportunities and gained a hearing; indeed, as he reminds
us in the second volume of <i>Sinister Street</i>, he has won the greater advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
of a hearing refused, the libraries having so ineffably rejected the first
volume. Nevertheless, from him that hath not&mdash;&mdash; What is it, in fact,
that has deprived him of the truest fruit of the gifts which he has? I make
no attempt to disguise the fact that Mr. Mackenzie appears to be a writer who
is not an imaginative artist, yet who might have been an imaginative artist;
a novelist who has not concerned himself with life at all save in its external
and mechanic motions. He has not confined himself to a single manner:
his first book, <i>The Passionate Elopement</i>, was an eighteenth-century story
in a style familiarised by less capable and less versatile practitioners. Little
indeed was to be expected from an author whose first book contained such
writing as:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Presently he saw her join a blue mask and lose herself in the flickering throng.
Last time he had remarked particularly that her <i>vis-à-vis</i> wore brown and gold, yet
the two figures were alike in movement and gesture, and he could swear the hands
were identical. It was the same without a doubt. Charles bit his nails with vexation,
and fretted confoundedly.</p>

<p>"My dear boy, my dear Charles, pray do not gnaw your fingers. Narcissus admired
himself, 'tis true, but without carrying his devotion to cannibality."</p>

<p>Charles turned to the well-known voice of Mr. Ripple.</p>

<p>"A thousand pardons, dear Beau, I was vexed by a trifle. The masquerade comports
itself with tolerable success."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">&mdash;and the glitter and varnish of an upholstered narrative casually spangled
with Meredithean brightness. But Mr. Mackenzie's second novel, <i>Carnival</i>,
disappointed expectation by being readable. Like some of its successors, it
might be mistaken for realistic; while another, <i>Guy and Pauline</i>, might be
termed idyllic by those who love the phrase. He moves and changes; he is a
part of all that he has met; and you wonder at length what <i>he</i> is. For myself,
I am reminded frequently of an ingenious character seen in provincial music-halls,
who to the eyes of a happy audience swiftly and imperceptibly invests
and divests himself of many costumes of marvellous hue&mdash;one growing plain
as another is impetuously flung off, blue gloves giving place to pink, a crimson
shirt to an emerald, a shooting-jacket to a dinner-jacket&mdash;until I laugh
unrestrainably.</p>

<p>Mr. Mackenzie has not sought a fugitive and cloistered virtue; his
characters, as Johnson said of Gilbert Walmsley, mingle in the great world
without exemption from its follies and its vices. He loves their activities;
he sets them going and follows their whirring motion with the ruthless
gaiety of a child playing with toys, who stops them, breaks them, and sometimes
sets them going again. He understands mechanics and they must
move; and when they are run down in one book he winds them up again
for another. He hurries hither and thither, clutching at the skirts of perpetual
motion like that other pageant master, time. His scene is the capitals of
Europe or a railway train between them. He shares with his characters, of
whatever age, their brilliant youth. He invents untiringly. He does not vex
himself or his readers with description, but if he pauses to paint he paints<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
with unmistakable bright colours. He writes clearly: there is seldom a
slovenly sentence, never a memorable one. He has a cruelly accurate ear for
slang, and presents vulgarity with fond verisimilitude. Femininity haunts
him; his flowers, even, remind him of frills. Something of extreme youth
clings to his books&mdash;its zestfulness, curiosity, indiscriminateness, and its
unregretful volatility. But when, you may ask, remembering at once his
gifts and his opportunities, his gifts and the world amid which they are
exercised, when will he grow up? When, rather, will he grow down and
strike first roots into the dark earth of the mind? When, amid all his brisk
preoccupations with men and women, will he touch life?</p>

<p>Leaving generalisation, it is interesting to look at one of the simplest of
Mr. Mackenzie's novels, <i>Guy and Pauline</i>, published in 1915, and conspicuously
dedicated to the Commander-in-Chief and the General Staff of
the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force. It is the story of Guy Hazlewood
(wound up again after <i>Sinister Street</i>) and a rector's daughter. Guy, returned
from Macedonian Relief Fund work, is charmed by a watery Oxfordshire
house called Plashers Mead, and settles there to write poetry. The rectory
family are his neighbours, and with the rector's daughters, Margaret, Monica,
and Pauline, he quickly obtains a brotherly footing, and then becomes
engaged to the youngest. The rector is a shadowy gardener with a singular
fondness for answering every question, upon whatever subject and of whatever
importance, by a reference to a blossoming or decaying plant; an
idiosyncrasy which is supposed to endear him to his family. And it is an
"endearing" book. Everybody is unvaryingly sweet; the adjective is as
common and as adhesive as mud. The three girls form a group of the kind
for which the far more finely observant and delicate art of Miss Viola Meynell
(among living novelists) has already obtained and exhausted our sympathy.
Ungracious as the comparison must seem to both writers, it is irresistible
and fatal. Linked sweetness too long drawn out becomes tiresome,
and the indistinct softness of the style makes the book something more
than tiresome.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pauline hurried through a shower to church on Easter morning, and shook mingled
tears and raindrops from herself when she saw that Guy was come to Communion.
So then that angel had travelled from her bedside last night to hover over Guy and
bid him wake early next morning, because it was Easter Day. With never so holy a
calm had she knelt in the jewelled shadows of that chancel or returned from the altar
to find her pew imparadised. When the people came out of church the sun was shining,
and on the trees and on the tombstones a multitude of birds were singing. Never had
Pauline felt the spirit of Eastertide uplift her with such a joy, joy for her lover beside
her, joy for summer close at hand, joy for all the joy that Easter could bring to the soul.</p></blockquote>

<p>Elsewhere:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The apple trees were already frilled with a foam of blossom; and on quivering
boughs linnets with breasts rose-burnt by the winds of March throbbed out their
carol. Chaffinches with flashing prelude of silver wings flourished a burst of song that
broke as with too intolerable a triumph: then sought another tree and poured forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
the triumphant song again. Thrushes, blackbirds and warblers quired deep-throated
melodies against the multitudinous trebles of those undistinguished myriads that
with choric pæan saluted May; and on sudden diminuendoes could be heard the
rustling canzonets of the goldfinches, rising and falling with reedy cadences.</p></blockquote>

<p>The story is clogged by Guy's meditations upon "poetical ambition"&mdash;he
is in the early twenties&mdash;and yet, with all these grievous handicaps, it
survives with sufficient force to express the poignancy with which an incomplete
passion may sink to oblivion. In Pauline Mr. Mackenzie has succeeded
in showing with simplicity and truth the quick development of a child to a
passionate, then a despairing, and at last a forsaken woman; and in Guy the
æsthetic frog swollen to a fraction larger than his nature and then relapsing
into insignificance. I am not sure that the best of this novelist's achievement
is not seen in the isolation of these characters, the sufficiency of quiet
incident, and the sense&mdash;faintly yet perceptibly communicated&mdash;that the
tragedy of separation is implicit in the persons of his story. The atmosphere
may seem close, the setting fanciful, scenes, characters, and action diminished
and slightly prettified; yet there is genuine movement, rise and decline. The
occasion of Guy's last parting from Pauline is worth noting, if only because
Guy happens to be but the present name of Mr. Mackenzie's invariable
young man from Oxford; let it be remembered, however, that Guy reappears
years after in <i>Sylvia and Michael</i> as a larger shadow and dies with the Serbians
before Nish.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Even if temporarily I were interested in another girl, you may be quite sure that
she would always be second to you."</p>

<p>"But you might be interested?" Pauline asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I must be free if I'm going to be an artist."</p>

<p>"Free?" she echoed slowly.</p></blockquote>

<p>There remains a negative merit. If the artist, as a hundred critics have
asserted and a thousand authors forgotten, is proved by what he omits, it
must be counted to Mr. Mackenzie for a virtue that this book of four hundred
pages does not contain a single seduction, and that, despite the obvious
piquancy of a contrast between Plashers Mead and a London night-club,
he has so easily and so blessedly avoided it.</p>

<p>The point is the more proper for remembrance inasmuch as such forbearance
is the last straining of the quality of mercy in this author. Mr. Mackenzie
commonly prefers cities to country scenes, although a country scene in his
earliest novel yielded him his first opportunity of teasing innocent readers
with an unsavoury interior. Since he is a cultured writer you might imagine
that Hogarth had tutored him; but Hogarth is immensely masculine, and
the origin of our novelist's inspiration need be sought no farther back than
the 'nineties. Nothing is more surprising, at any rate to men approaching
middle-age, than the fitful incandescence of that spark with which the
'nineties were tinily illuminated. The inferior intelligence and the yet more
inferior imagination which impelled certain artists&mdash;pleased with the phrase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
decadent&mdash;to magnify the ferment of youthful senses, may now seem even
more trivial in their fruition than an Olympian judgment would allow. But it
is hard to be impartial when a purely remote contemplation is forbidden by
the flashing reflections from living writers who are only in a narrow sense
contemporary writers. Coventry Patmore, chief poet and almost chief artist
in that church of which we hear so much in Mr. Mackenzie's novels, asserted
with more force than originality that what is morally bad is necessarily bad
art; and he proceeded to say, less tritely, that the delicate indecency of so
much modern art was partly due to deficient virility which, in proportion to
its strength, is naturally modest. Pleading for plain-speaking, he maintained
that indecency (which only a fool could identify with plain-speaking) is an
endeavour to irritate sensations and appetites in the absence of natural
passion; that which passes with so many for power and ardour being really,
in his certain and indignant eyes, impotence and coldness. The distinction
between plain-speaking and delicate indecency is to be remembered when
Mr. Mackenzie's most ambitious attempts at the English novel, <i>Sinister
Street</i> and <i>Sylvia Scarlett</i>, are considered. There may be coarseness of
expression, a fondness for trivial bluntness of phrase; but it would be stupid
to see in that more than coarseness or bluntness. The theme of <i>Sinister
Street</i>, says the author, is the youth of a man who will presumably be a
priest; a theme developed in nearly four hundred thousand words by something
like the process of "annual elongation" which Johnson observed in
a Hebridean road. The book moves upon familiar biographical lines&mdash;the
lonely children, the local school and lesser public school, Oxford, and the
betrayed passion for a prostitute. It is an enormous and minute chronicle&mdash;of
what? Of the externals of a boy's life, of the customs of school, flirtation with
vulgar girls, evasions of school tasks, the ways of a decrepit group surviving
from the 'nineties, Catholic ritual, and a little introspection here and there;
and then, in the second volume, of the same externals of Oxford life drawn
to the same scale. Such a scheme must needs attract the tens who have been
to public school and University, and delight the tens of thousands who
haven't. Is it taking a mean advantage of time's passage to compare <i>Sinister
Street</i> with Serge Aksakoff's <i>Years of Childhood</i> and its successors?
Aksakoff treats childhood with a simplicity, a quiet intentness, by the side
of which Mr. Mackenzie's enormous reconstruction seems loose and artificial.
<i>Sinister Street</i> is vast in size and meagre in content. It is packed with superfluities.
Three-fourths of it is inessential to the author's declared intention;
it is no more than a guide-book cleverly designed (<i>e.g.</i>, the first week at
Oxford) to evoke an illusion of Oxford in Pimlico and Shepherd's Bush;
and concentrating upon the remaining fourth, you feel that your author
has been aware of little more than the physiology of adolescence and the
usual facile religious reactions. Boys from seventeen to twenty-three, girls
from sixteen to any age, may find in Henry Meats <i>alias</i> Brother Aloysius,
in Arthur Wilmot the last of the Decadents, in the Lilys and the Daisys of
the streets, in the whole rank multitude of Mr. Mackenzie's "underworld,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span>
the irritation of sensation which adolescents naturally seek. Here may
curiosity be half-satisfied, half-stimulated. A Guide to Prostitution could
add little to the informations of <i>Sinister Street</i>: the dress, the habitation,
even the finances of those who have "gone gay," are meticulously recorded.
Passed, I am afraid, are the Orient promenade and the underground gilded
sty, but their glory is not departed, it is merely transferred, and <i>Sinister
Street</i> remains sufficiently lively and up to date to provoke the youngest
and make the oldest feel young again. Do you ask why God gives brains for
such a use? I cannot even guess. Mr. Mackenzie astonishingly blazons his
book with Keats's famous analysis: "The imagination of a boy is healthy,
and the mature imagination of a man is healthy; but there is a space of life
between, in which the soul is in a ferment, etc."&mdash;an astonishing phrase for
index to this book; whether used in simplicity or in subtle defiance, this also
I cannot guess. Clear enough is it that what passes for imagination is no other
than the froth of yesty waves of youth.... It is a book written, if offence
may be disavowed and avoided, by a boy for boys. Mr. Mackenzie himself,
in his introductory letter, refers to his study of Russian writers (this in
explanation of the length of his novels), and in his epilogical letter he apparently
regards the book as a work of art. An author's opinion of his own
intention is to be respected, for who shall challenge it? It does but afford
an additional ground for judgment and surprise.</p>

<p>To consider <i>Sinister Street</i> a mere aberration is an extravagant possibility,
but possibility itself is left panting behind <i>Sylvia Scarlett</i>. Here, again, the
author is generous of space, and here he has not been content to write a
guide-book. He has chosen a woman for his central figure, and she, unlike
the male protagonists of the other books, is no coloured cloudy reflection of
a reflection. She is no minikin Michael or Guy or Maurice, but a semblable
moving figure. Sinister Street is her place of origin, Vanity Fair her scene
of action&mdash;a world of music-halls where farce passes for fantasy and women's
dress for an exciting theme. Farce? Sylvia is not only farcical in herself,
but is, like Falstaff, creative&mdash;the cause of farce in others; and though Book
One opens so admirably with a paragraph showing how well the author can
follow a good model, farce ensues and recurs and makes her chronicle an
amusing thing.</p>

<p>But it is amusing only so long as coarseness is not strained through a
child's mind, coarseness of phrase only or more significant coarseness of
invention. I say more significant, for whether that worse coarseness is
intended or involuntary must be immaterial, save as indicating the particular
code against which the offence is primarily committed, the code of manners or
the code of art. There is here no such gentleness in the treatment of childhood
as distinguishes the earlier chapters of <i>Carnival</i>.... The point need not
be stressed. I dislike the current practice of setting one's wits against the
author whose work happens to be the subject of discussion; I don't want to
produce an artificial dilemma and pretend that Mr. Mackenzie is inevitably
trapped by it. Put it, then, that there are certain obligations of civilised life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
and certain obligations of that flower of civilised life which we call art; put
it that coarseness of phrase or incident outrages the former, and that an
intention to commit that outrage, or an insensibility of having committed
it, is equally an offence against the less assertive but not less imperative
obligations of art. In a word, the sin is vulgarity, two-edged vulgarity it may
be, an offence against both canons or, if you will, both conventions; and the
further weight hangs on the charge that it is here committed in the person of
a child, and is, therefore, wanton. Shall I add that the immanence of farce
just spoken of does in a little degree mitigate the cruelty by generalising the
vulgarity? Here is rude, healthy Smollett out-Smolletted, reduced to the
uncostly and only half-odious horseplay of a music-hall:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The encouragement put a fine spirit into Danny's blows; he hammered the unfortunate
Cohen round and round the room, upsetting table and chairs and washstand
until with a stinging blow he knocked him backwards into the slop-pail, in which he
sat so heavily that when he tried to rise the slop-pail stuck and gave him the appearance
of a large baboon crawling with elevated rump on all fours. Danny kicked off the
slop-pail, and invited Cohen to stand up to him; but when he did get on his feet, he
ran to the door and reached the stairs just as Mrs. Gonner was wearily ascending to
find out what was happening. He tried to stop himself by clutching the knob of the
baluster, which broke; the result was that he dragged Mrs. Gonner with him in a
glissade which ended behind the counter. The confusion in the shop became general;
Mr. Gonner cut his thumb, and the sight of the blood caused a woman who was
eating a sausage to choke; another customer took advantage of the row to snatch a
side of bacon and try to escape, but another customer with a finer moral sense prevented
him; a dog who was sniffing in the entrance saw the bacon on the floor and
tried to seize it, but getting his tail trodden upon by somebody, he took fright and bit
a small boy, who was waiting to change a shilling into coppers. Meanwhile Sylvia,
who expected every minute that Jubie and her pugilistic brother would come back
and increase the confusion with possibly unpleasant consequences for herself, took
advantage of Danny's being occupied in an argument with Cohen and the two Gonners
to put on her hat and escape from the shop. She jumped on the first omnibus and
congratulated herself when she looked round and saw a policeman entering the eating-house.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sylvia herself is capable enough as well as universally attractive. The
citation just made is from a passage following the second amorous attack
upon her, when Danny Lewis threatens her with a knife, and she parries
with the water in her bedroom. An earlier lover had retired from a similar
contest with his underlip bitten through. When, some time after the knife-and-water
episode, Sylvia meets the Oxford type in Philip Iredale, she is
sent by him (being still but sixteen) for a year's schooling and then marries
him. Coquetting with the Church is followed by flight&mdash;alone, it must be
added; and indeed Sylvia's whole recorded life is fugitive, a pilgrimage
between this world and some other. Three months later her husband's
Oxford composure is shocked by:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"You <i>must</i> divorce me now. I've not been able to earn enough to pay you back
more than this [ten pounds] for your bad bargain. I don't think I've given any more
pleasure to the men who have paid less for me than you did, if that's any consolation."</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">Adventures repeat themselves. A huge Russian officer bursts into Sylvia's
room one night and is pitched out of the window by a couple of acrobats.
The war begins and spreads itself over Europe as a background for her
passages and parleyings; and maybe the Commander-in-Chief and the
General Staff of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force have beguiled
many a tiresome after-war hour in pursuing Sylvia's wanderings between
places familiarised by their late anxieties. Sylvia is differentiated from the
other women of these novels, not only by her superior capacity for experiences,
but even more by her superior volubility. She is, consciously, mind as
well as body, and as the narrative goes on and on she develops a passion for
monologue&mdash;terrifying in any woman, and rare among women whose
occupation Sylvia Scarlett's own name is perhaps meant assonantally to
suggest. These monologues, recurrent as the farce and more deadly, might
be called shortly the jargon. "I represent the original conception of the
Hetaera," she asserts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"He'll think of me, if he ever thinks of me at all, as one of the great multitude of
wronged women. I shall think of him, though as a matter of fact I shall avoid thinking
of him, either as what might have been&mdash;a false concept, for, of course, what might
have been is fundamentally inconceivable&mdash;or as what he was&mdash;a sentimental fool."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">She meditates upon the art of Botticelli, whose appeal she seems to think is
only childlike, upon the conflict of nationality with civilisation. She reads
Tolstoi and Dostoieffsky, putting Apuleius by, goes to confession, analyses
her sensations, details the errancy of her parentage, and seeks to shock the
priest who, when Sylvia acutely suggests that God is "almost vulgarly
anthropomorphic," can only murmur, "Are not five sparrows sold for two
farthings, and not one of them is forgotten before God?" But here is a
brief specimen of the almost unbroken monologue to which the priest of
the wisest of the churches can make no answer but a profession of the power
of the Church:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I suppose my running away was the direct result of my bringing up, because
whenever I had been brought face to face with a difficult situation I ran away. However,
this time I was determined from some perverted pride to make myself more
utterly myself than I had ever done. It's hard to explain how my mind worked. You
must remember I was only nineteen, and already at thirty-one I am as far from
understanding all my motives then as if I were trying to understand somebody who
was not myself at all. Anyhow, I simply went on the streets. For three months I
mortified my flesh by being a harlot. Can you understand that? Can you possibly
understand the deliberate infliction of such a discipline, not to humiliate one's pride
but to exalt it? Can you understand that I emerged from that three months of incredible
horror with a complete personality?..."</p>

<p>Sylvia did not wait for the priest to answer this question, partly because she did
not want to be disillusioned by finding so soon that he had not comprehended
anything of her emotions or actions, partly because there seemed more important
revelations of herself still to be made.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">&mdash;Farce at least is unpretentious, but this crude jargon, this retroverted
intellectualism, is offensive beyond farce, odious beyond "delicate
indecency."</p>

<p>It may not be wholly due to perversity if the characteristics of these long
biographical novels should overshadow the sharp merits of, say, <i>Carnival</i>.
<i>Carnival</i>, even better than <i>Guy and Pauline</i>, may serve as a measure of Mr.
Mackenzie's decline from his promise; since although its conclusion is a
disharmony, its best chapters are good enough to cause a reader to sigh over
the later novels. Was it, indeed, quite a worthless aim to follow in the footsteps
of George Gissing? <i>Carnival</i> suggests that a new Gissing might have
grown up before our eyes, with a touch of the same veracity, the same
mordancy, and a little less than the same humourless and dishumoured
regard for what is wry and hapless; but <i>Carnival</i> stands alone, and the
exactions of that difficult sincerity have been put by.... Or take, again,
<i>Poor Relations</i>, the latest of Mr. Mackenzie's inventions. With its ease and
brilliant vivacities, with the comedy of its conception, what a delightful play
it would make! But might not the comedy have depended&mdash;as comedy must&mdash;more
surely upon character and less upon incident? The author of <i>Sylvia
Scarlett</i>, however, has imposed a too-swift facility upon the author of <i>Poor
Relations</i>. If practice makes perfect, then nothing was wanting to the completeness
of <i>Poor Relations</i>&mdash;but how much is wanting! Admirable are the
opening notes, but of the rest too much is a brisk <i>falsetto</i>. There is excess in
the situations, excess in the characterisation, excess in the style:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When he looked at the old lady he could not discover anything except a cold
egotism in every fold of those flabby cheeks where the powder lay like drifted snow
in the ruts of a sunless lane.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It is equally the virtue and the fault of Mr. Mackenzie that he provokes
melancholy regrets, even in the middle of frequent chuckles; and when the
chuckling has died away the shadow of <i>Sylvia Scarlett</i> falls upon the book,
just as with the same unhappy denigration it is flung backwards over the
better qualities of the earlier <i>Carnival</i>.</p>

<p>Yet <i>Poor Relations</i>, like <i>Guy and Pauline</i>, is free from the worst flaw of the
longer novels, the crude determination to shock, which breaks most starkly
through the superficialities of <i>Sylvia Scarlett</i>. That is a breach of the code of
art rather than the code of morals, an eruptive <i>épatism</i> which would disfigure
a better book, if it could be found there. Can you conceive a more attractive
subject, if you are but three-and-twenty, than the philosophic harlot? Or
an easier? I do not suppose that it is less interesting to be on the streets than
to be in the Ministry of Food; neither occupation can be objectionable as
subject of a novel. It would be untrue to say that the subject of a novel is a
thing of complete indifference, and that the treatment is everything; for a
writer would not do wisely to forfeit the advantage which a subject might
offer him. But neither would he do wisely in exploiting a subject only to
excite the curiosity or astonish the simplicity of his reader. Merely adventitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
at best is the gain. It is to reduce subject and treatment to their lowest
terms, and reject the implicit conditions which confront every writer who
would explore the imaginative world where there can be no laws save honour,
loyalty, and delicacy. The scientific writer is secured against deceiving himself
or his readers for long; his assumptions can be verified, his deductions
precisely analysed, his whole professions rationally weighed. The imaginative
and the quasi-imaginative writer have no such security, nor their readers
such protection. Traditional values may be inapplicable; it is hard to discriminate
novelty from originality. A book that shocks may be as profoundly
conceived as <i>Jude the Obscure</i>, as cheaply fashioned as <i>Sylvia Scarlett</i>.
Incident may be prodigal equally in Dostoieffsky and Mr. Compton
Mackenzie, but significance of incident may vary infinitely. Mr. Mackenzie's
incidents have no significance; they remain incidents. His thoughts are
insignificant except in so far as they indicate a modern intellectual disvertebration.
His view of character is insignificant except in so far as it betrays an
adolescent apprehension. Who is Sylvia? you ask, and your author is silent.
What is she? and the answer is dispersed among eight hundred garrulous
pages.</p>

<p>Yet, it must be repeated, Mr. Mackenzie has conspicuous gifts, and, as the
letters with which <i>Sinister Street</i> opens and closes indicate, he is aware of
them, and has not undertaken these enormous fictions without a sense of his
task. But he has accepted the easier way. He can invest his scene with an
illusion of activity, if not of reality, but he is unable to picture reality, for
he does not distinguish; neither does he create a reality, a world for himself,
amenable to its own laws, establishing its own consistency. That would be a
wonderful but a hard thing. Amid the booths of his Vanity Fair he moves,
not soberly and critically as Christian and Faithful moved, but as one swiftly
enchanted by externals. He approaches the field of imaginative art, and I
cannot say that his powers and pretensions are such as must discourage
entry; but for imagination he learns to substitute invention, chooses the
superficial, and does not even trouble to secure the consistency of his characters;
Michael Fane's mother, for instance, being declined from an irregular
great lady in Volume One to a parish imbecile in Volume Two. He might have
chosen otherwise. His alertness, his preoccupation with externals, his fullness

<h3 class="left">GENERAL NOTES</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">MR.</span> Septimus Rivington's recently published book, <i>The Publishing
Family of Rivington</i> (Rivington, 1919; 10<i>s.</i> net), contains a certain amount
of interesting information about the eighteenth-century book trade.
Charles Rivington started publishing in 1711. His successor, John,
succeeded Jacob Tonson (great-nephew of the original Jacob Tonson
who published Dryden's works) as managing partner of the institution known as the
"Conger," the association of booksellers formed to share the risks and the profits of
publishing ventures. In this volume Mr. Rivington has printed a number of Conger
documents in his possession. It is interesting to learn the trade value of well-known
books of the period. Thus, one-eighth of Archbishop Tillotson's works is bought by
Tonson in 1711 for £87 10<i>s.</i> In 1738 a third part of Watts's <i>Hymns</i> is worth £70.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Mr. Rivington prints several extracts from old catalogues in his possession, which
show that a book sale in the eighteenth century was a convivial affair. The catalogue of
Thomas Osborne's stock-in-trade, consisting of books, copyrights, and shares in publications,
is issued "to a select number of booksellers at the Queen's Head Tavern, in
Paternoster Row, on Thursday, the ninth day of February, 1743/4, at Eleven of the
Clock in the Forenoon. DINNER will be served on the table exactly at One of the
Clock, consisting of Turkies and Chines, Hams and Chickens, Apple-pies, etc., and a
Glass of very good Wine."</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Another recent book by a member of one of our great publishing families is Mr.
John Murray's brief memoir of his father, John Murray the Third, the inventor of what
was in his day an entirely new literary form, the <i>Guide Book</i>. Murray's first guide was
issued in 1836. Three years later Karl Baedeker published a <i>Handbüchlein</i> of the same
districts. Baedeker, like Shakespeare, disdained to invent his own plots. Murray's
eighteen European guides were the <i>Plutarch</i> and <i>Holinshed</i> of the German's stupendous
creations.</p>

<p>Those who hope, by taking advantage of the present rate of exchange, to secure
German books at an eighth or tenth of their value will be sorry to hear that German
publishers are in league to put a stop to such delightful bargains. They are insisting on
being paid at the rate of about fivepence to the mark; so that your books will cost you
as much as half their real price.</p>

<p>We were surprised, considering the blockade and the general shortage, at the excellent
"get-up" of such recent German publications as we have seen. Among them were
two illustrated volumes, one on Egyptian and the other on Negro art, published during
the war, and produced in the most magnificent style. Almost more surprising were some
exquisite little volumes of Czech poetry published at Prague, in which print, paper, and
binding were all equally admirable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
A book for which one may search long in vain, but for which it is worth while to
take some trouble, is the <i>Memorie di Lorenzo da Ponte da Ceneda</i>, three volumes, New
York, 1829. Da Ponte is well known as the librettist of a number of Mozart's operas,
and should be better known as the author of some of the most charming of eighteenth-century
memoirs. His memoirs and poetical works were republished at Florence in
1871, and a French translation of the memoirs only was executed by M. C. D. de la
Chavanne (Paris, Pagnerre, 1860). So far as we are aware, no English translation of this
work exists. If this is indeed the case, it is high time that the defect was remedied. The
<i>Memorie Inutili</i> of Da Ponte's earlier contemporary, Carlo Gozzi (three volumes, Venice,
1797), were translated by John Addington Symonds, and published in a very sumptuous
illustrated edition by Nimmo in 1890.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Another important book on the Italian eighteenth century, and one which it is not
easy to find a copy of in any edition, is the <i>Lettres Historiques et Critiques sur l'Italie</i> of
the Président Charles de Brosses (Paris, Ponthieu, An VII., and under the title <i>Le
Président de Brosses en Italie</i>, Paris, 1858). De Brosses' letters make the best possible
book to take on a voyage to Italy.</p>

<p>Londoners cannot have failed to notice in the past weeks the presence of numerous
posters&mdash;we have seen them in every part of the city&mdash;bearing the legend: "The Bishops
must open Joanna Southcott's Box and save the country from ruin." We hope that this
faint echo of a vanished notoriety may arouse among book-lovers an interest in Joanna's
numerous literary works. The first of them, <i>The Strange Effects of Faith</i>, was published
at Exeter in 1792, and from that time onwards she poured forth a stream of prophecies
in prose and verse. In one of the latest of them (the last part of <i>The Book of Wonder</i>, if
we remember rightly; but it is some years since we saw the book) is a superb engraving
of a cradle subscribed for by Joanna's disciples against the birth of Shiloh. Shiloh,
unhappily, was never born, and Joanna Southcott died three months after the presentation
of the two-hundred-guinea cot. Enthusiastic bibliographers will find plenty of
interest in the study of Southcottian literature; first editions are satisfactorily scarce.
As for the box&mdash;well, why don't the Bishops open it? Who knows? it might save us
from ruin, more effectually perhaps than all the politicians together.</p>

<p>An important collection of autograph letters and historical documents, the property
of the late Charles Fairfax Murray, is to be sold at Messrs. Sotheby's on Thursday and
Friday, February 5th and 6th. The first 163 lots are autographs of famous artists, and
include four letters of Blake, Michelangelo's specification for the tomb of Julius II., a
letter of Benvenuto Cellini, a letter of Albrecht Dürer, illustrated by charming little
sketches, letters of Gainsborough, Hogarth, Reynolds, and Constable, a letter of Titian
written at the age of eighty-five, and a series of notes by Leonardo on the flight of birds.</p>

<p>Lots 164 to 280 are of historical, literary, and musical interest. One of the most interesting
items is the MS. of Baudelaire's <i>La Charogne</i>, with a drawing of a woman by the
poet. A beautifully written letter from Lucretia Borgia to Cardinal D'Este is another
remarkable piece.</p>

<p>Lots 281-286 are documents which will appeal to collectors of relics of Mary Queen
of Scots. The first is a document signed by Bothwell; four are letters of John Lesley,
Bishop of Ross; and the last a document signed by William Davison, Queen Elizabeth's
agent in Scotland.</p>

<h3 class="left">ITEMS FROM THE BOOKSELLERS' CATALOGUES</h3>

<p>Messrs. Maggs's catalogue (No. 386) of autograph letters and MSS. contains a
number of items which will be of interest to musicians. In a letter to Birchall, the English
music publisher, dated October, 1831, Beethoven writes the following sentence: "I
have duly received the 5 £s, and thought previously you would not encrease the number
of englishmen neglecting their word and honor, as I had the misfortune of meeting with
two of this sort." He goes on to offer Birchall a Grand Sonata for the Pianoforte for £40,
and a Trio for piano, violin, and cello for £50. The letter is priced at £21. There are
also four letters of Wagner, a note in the handwriting of Sir Arthur Sullivan (12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>),
a signed autograph piece by Gounod (£3 10<i>s.</i>), letters of Berger, Spontini, Balfe, Hiller
and Heller, Verdi, Thalberg, Paganini, Brahms, and Liszt; there is an autograph musical
MS. of Mendelssohn dated 1844 (£10 10<i>s.</i>), and another of a Scena composed by Haydn
for Signora Banti (£85).</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Other pieces of the greatest interest are advertised in the same catalogue. A beautifully
written letter in the hand of Benvenuto Cellini is priced £105. Another letter of slightly
earlier date than Cellini's is the almost illegible scrawl of Götz von Berlichingen, the
Knight of the Iron Hand (£32). The collection also includes several very important
letters of Byron: one to John Murray (October 29th, 1819), in which he speaks of his
Memoirs, entrusted to Moore, and afterwards solemnly burnt at Murray's house in
Albemarle Street (£105): one to Kinnaird (1822) on the morality of Don Juan.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Mr. Francis Edwards has also issued a catalogue of autograph letters which contains
many items of remarkable interest. <i>Hrothgar</i>, a seventy-eight verse ballad (unpublished),
by George Borrow, is a curious by-product of Beowulf scholarship, which ought to be
worth the thirty pounds at which it is priced. Among the five autograph letters of
Thomas Carlyle we find one addressed to the Bishop of Chester (August 23rd, 1840),
in which Carlyle writes: "May I apply to you for a charitable service on behalf of a
certain Mr. Mazzini, an Italian neighbour and friend of mine?" Two holograph manuscripts
of John Evelyn are offered for £15 and £25 respectively. Ten pounds is the price
of a letter from Sir William Hamilton (Naples, 1792) to Horace Walpole, in which
Hamilton remarks of his famous wife: "She is ... most grateful to me for having saved
her from the precipice into which she had good sense enough to see she must, without
me, have inevitably fallen, and she sees that nothing but a constant good conduct can
maintain the respect that is now shown her by everybody. It has often been remarked
that a reformed rake makes a good husband, why not <i>vice versa</i>?" Why not? The
answer is to be found in a letter from Nelson to Lady Hamilton (Yarmouth, 1801;
£21). Other Nelson and Hamilton autographs, the Morrison collection, are on sale at
Messrs. Suckling's, of Garrick Street.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Other interesting letters and manuscripts offered by Messrs. Edwards are by
Dr. Johnson, Samuel Richardson, Swinburne, Meredith, Landor, Pepys, Lamb,
Southey, Thackeray.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We are glad to notice that a manuscript by a young contemporary can command as
big a price as ten guineas. This is the sum asked by Messrs. Davis and Orioli for the
autograph MS. of Mr. Robert Nichols's <i>The Faun's Holiday</i>, published in his volume of
<i>Ardours and Endurances</i>. To buy it would certainly be a speculation; but we believe
there is a good chance of the speculation turning out profitably.</p>

autograph MS. of a portion of <i>Otho the Great</i>, which is offered by Messrs. Maggs Bros.
for £60. The MS., entirely in Keats's own writing, is a fragment of the first scene of the
play.</p>

<p>Messrs. Maggs Bros.' new catalogue, <i>Bibliotheca Aeronautica</i>, price 5<i>s.</i>, is a fascinating
book. It contains the account of some fifteen hundred volumes dealing with the problem
of flight from the earliest times to the present day. The first section contains books
published prior to the invention of the Montgolfier Balloon in 1783. A fine copy of
Francesco de Lana's <i>Prodromo Overo Saggio di Alcune Inventioni</i> appears in this section
(£16 16<i>s.</i>). Paltock's famous flying novel, <i>The Life and Adventures of Peter Wilkins</i>,
London, 1751, is offered at £15 15<i>s.</i>, and the work which Restif de la Bretonne founded
on it, <i>La Découverte Australe par un Homme Volant, ou le Dédale Français</i>, at £18 18<i>s.</i>
Fine engravings are reproduced from these books.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In the second section we find a number of Blanchard's narratives, including the
account of the first aerial crossing of the Channel; we find Lunardi's <i>Account of the
First Aerial Voyage in England</i>, London, 1784 (£7 10<i>s.</i>); several books on the Montgolfier
brothers, as well as the works of the great Baron Munchausen, so famed for
his aeronautical exploits.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The third section of the catalogue deals with the evolution of aircraft from 1851 to
1899. An interesting item is the first edition of Rémy de Gourmont's <i>En Ballon</i>, Paris,
1883. A large number of works by Tissandier, author of the <i>Bibliographie Aéronautique</i>,
Paris, 1887, naturally appear. We may here note the remarkable fact that by far the
greater number of the volumes on flight are in French. British interest in the problem
was not aroused till a good deal later, after the first practical difficulties had been solved.
A first edition of Jules Verne's <i>Robur le Conquérant</i>, Paris, 1886, is included (15<i>s.</i>).
His <i>Six Weeks in a Balloon</i> also deserves a place.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In the fourth section we come to "Aeroplanes and Dirigibles in the Twentieth
Century." The period opens with the intrepid Santos-Dumont and his flights and falls
over Paris. His <i>My Airships</i>, London, 1904, is priced at 10<i>s.</i> The handsomest aeronautical
work published during this period is perhaps <i>La Conquête de l'Air</i>, by Grand-Carteret

<h3>A PROTEST</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your dramatic critic writes of my play <i>Sacred and Profane Love</i>, "A writer
of Mr. Arnold Bennett's eminence and great sagacity would be the last person to expect
us to take this play seriously as a contribution to dramatic literature." Only a certain
ingenuousness prevents this remark from being outrageous. Of course I expect the play
to be taken seriously. Your writer is perfectly entitled to condemn my play; but he is
not entitled on the strength of his opinion to attribute to me an attitude which is not
mine, and which, if it were mine, would render me odious in the sight of artists. Why
in the name of my alleged great sagacity should I publish a play which I did not expect
to be taken seriously? Did your critic perhaps imagine that he was being charitable?
One does not expect from the critics of <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span> the ineptitudes which
characterise the dramatic criticism of the stunt daily Press. I mention the matter because
I think that an important point of principle is involved, and because this is not the first
time that one of your critics has exceeded his province. In your first number there were
references to the work of Mr. Frank Swinnerton which amounted to a quite gratuitous
imputation against the artistic integrity of the author.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<p>[We gladly publish Mr. Bennett's disclaimer, but we think he exaggerates the gravity
of the supposition he repels. We need scarcely say that our critic had no intention of
imputing to Mr. Bennett anything which we supposed would render Mr. Bennett
odious. Taking the view that he did of Mr. Bennett's play, our critic thought he was
paying a compliment to Mr. Bennett's intelligence. If it is odious to write, occasionally,
things which we do not regard as serious contributions to literature, we can only say
that a great many artists have made themselves odious. As for Mr. Swinnerton, our
reviewer, detecting a falling off, suggested that it might be due to the novelist having
got into the habit of turning novels out regularly instead of waiting for the impulse.
If a serious reviewer is to be precluded, when he thinks himself justified, from making
suggestions like that, he might just as well be muzzled.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>]</p>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. Turner says he can hardly believe that the section of the audience which
behaved so abominably at the "Phœnix" performance consisted largely of the theatrical
profession. I think he is right. I happen to know that an effort was made by two actors
in the audience to get a request for order made from the stage during the first interval.</p>

<p>Nor were these people entirely of the "uneducated" sort&mdash;in the conventional
sense. One of the worst offenders was a terrible woman sitting next to me, who occasionally
interrupted her nervous giggle to remark, "A wonderfully characteristic
touch!" or something of the kind. I believe she must have been a don.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
May I suggest that at the next performance by the "Phœnix," if similar trouble
occurs, the matter should be brought to the notice of the management during the first
interval, and that a request should be made from the stage by the latter? Personal
requests to individual offenders were made by more than one member of the audience
at the performance in question, but without result. It is worth while making a concerted
effort to prevent the authentic joy of the theatre, when at last it is offered to us, from
being marred by the behaviour of vulgar sentimentalists and neurotics.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h3>THE LAMBKIN MSS. AND MR. BELLOC</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your valued bibliographer classifies the <i>Remains</i> of the Rev. J. A. Lambkin
among the verse attributable to their editor. I feel very strongly the impiety of this error.
For, although the influence of that eminent divine is traceable in the Dedicatory Ode
prefixed by Mr. Belloc to the <i>Remains</i> of his great mentor, it is nevertheless in the
realm of prose that we must look for Lambkin's main contributions to knowledge and
literature. True it is that the late Fellow of Burford's justly famed Newdigate Poem is
included in the definitive edition&mdash;indeed, Mr. Belloc must have felt the impossibility
of rejecting its claims to such inclusion&mdash;yet, if I may quote a delightful "Lambkinism"
which deserves a wider fame, "One swallow does not make a summer"; and, as one
who owes a goodly part of the culture discernible (as I trust) in this letter to the author
of the <i>Article on the North-West Corner of the Mosaic Pavement at Bignor</i>, I feel I should
be untrue to the memory of my late dear tutor if I allowed such glories to be catalogued
as if they formed part of the verses of a mere poet. No, sir, Lambkin is "this England's"
Seneca, and all who treasure a great cultural inheritance should rally to do justice to its
<i>Remains</i>. The late Dr. Pusey, whose character held so much in common with that of
his younger disciple, never tired of narrating that wonderful instance of Lambkin's
profound yet finely epigrammatic Latinity which is connected with the death of the
late Pastor of Bremen, I think. I was present on that occasion, and can testify that, far
from any library, Mr. Lambkin, after a short silence lasting perhaps for two minutes,
whispered the words <i>Requiescat in Pace</i>&mdash;surely the most terse and crisp of potential
epitaphs and one almost certain to secure the immediate popularity which it obtained,
falling as it did upon the receptive soil afforded by the Oxford Movement from which
event in our history the expression dates. As the fact is not generally known, perhaps,
sir, you will allow me to state here that the present Sir Ezra Crumpton-Padge of
Whortlebury Towers, near Brixton, is now the sole surviving link between the author<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
of <i>Physiology of the Elephant</i> and our own times, the claims to this honour made by
M. Lamkinski, President-elect of the Kacheefucan Soviet, having been expressly
refuted by that gentleman's father-in-law, M. Georgeovitch Bernardenko Shavkin, the
well-known big-game hunter and editor of <i>Agapé</i>.</p>

<p>Curiously enough Mr. Belloc's fine monograph on the "<i>Padge</i>" <i>System of Rhetoric</i>
makes no allusion to this interesting example of what we may surely describe, in the
truest sense of Lambkin's happiest aphorism, as a "survival of the fittest." Your
bibliographer will doubtless wish to note these <i>errata</i>. Meanwhile I trust the importance
of the subject may condone in some measure for the length of this letter.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h3>CANDIDE</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It is interesting to learn from Mr. Lewis H. Grundy's letter in your issue of
December that an English translation of <i>Candide</i>, with the name of M. de Voltaire as
the author of the original, was published in London as early as 1759.</p>

<p>According to the preface of the edition of the Académie des Bibliophiles of 1869
<i>Candide</i> first appeared at the beginning of March, 1759, the <i>Journal Encyclopédique</i> of
the 15th of that month containing an article on the book, which is headed by the
following:</p>

<p>"We do not believe that this tale has a German original. It is attributed to M. de V."</p>

<p>This note produced a reply from Voltaire signed "Démad."</p>

<h2><span class="smcap">LEARNED SOCIETIES, Etc.</span></h2>

<h3 class="left">THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IN</span> the recent Housing Supplement issued by the <i>Times</i> the Society for the Protection
of Ancient Buildings has expressed its views on the housing problem in
connection with old cottages. There are in this article two main points worth
noting. The first is that until a subsidy is made, proportionate to the value of
the work of repair, old cottages will not be readapted, but allowed to fall into
ruins. The failure to award this subsidy tends to shift the responsibility, in regard to
the upkeep of such property, from the owner to the State, for whilst the State encourages
and partially finances new building, old cottages, though in theory valued by the
Ministry of Health, in practice will hardly receive the attention they deserve. The
second point is this: that the Society shows clearly it is no lover of mere decay, or old
and mouldering walls, features we are apt to associate with the sketches of an early
nineteenth century schoolgirl.</p>

<p>It lends no countenance to the habitual carping at all things new. It is as eager that
the architecture of to-day should be as clean and decent&mdash;the natural expression of the
life of to-day&mdash;as it is anxious to preserve, and where possible render habitable, those
buildings of the past embodying the spirit of <i>their</i> time.</p>

<p>But since "words will build no walls," if our fine old cottages are to be preserved,
it will need something more than mere discussions or eulogiums on their value as relics
of the nation's past. By all who are interested more practical help must be given, and it
is for this that the Society now makes a special appeal.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE ROYAL NUMISMATIC SOCIETY</h3>

<p>The monthly meeting of the Royal Numismatic Society was held on December 18th,
Sir Henry Howorth, Vice-President, presiding. Mr. G. F. Hill read a paper entitled
"The Mint of Crosraguel Abbey," written by Dr. George Macdonald, who was unable
to be present. Recent excavations at Crosraguel ("Crossregal") Abbey, a Cluniac
foundation in Ayrshire, founded in 1244, and endowed by the Scottish kings with
extraordinary privileges, resulted in the discovery in a latrine-drain of a large number
of small objects, some of a miscellaneous nature, others evidently the remains of a local
mint: large quantities of small tags of brass, needles, portions of thin sheets, etc., as
well as objects and pieces of copper and lead, together with 197 coins of billon, bronze,
or copper and brass. The coins are (<i>a</i>) contemporary imitations of pennies of James III.
and IV., and farthings of James IV., including twenty which are a combination of the
obverse of one type with the reverse of another; (<i>b</i>) fifty-one pennies bearing a <i>cross</i> on
one side and a <i>regal</i> orb on the other, and the inscriptions <i>Jacobus Dei Gra. Rex</i> and
<i>Crux pellit omne crimen</i> variously abbreviated; (<i>c</i>) eighty-eight copper or brass farthings,
of types not hitherto known, inscribed <i>Moneta Pauperum</i>. The imitations of class
(<i>a</i>) are the "black money" known from records. The pennies of class (<i>b</i>) are almost
exclusively found in Scotland, though they have hitherto been attributed to one or
other James of Aragon. They were clearly minted at Crosraguel, the types having a
punning significance. They and the farthings are the only known instance in Great
Britain of an Abbey coinage, such as is very frequent on the Continent, <i>e.g.</i>, at Cluny.
The inscription <i>Moneta pauperum</i> shows that the coins were intended to provide small
change for the especial benefit of the poor like the seventeenth century tokens. The
mint was probably suppressed by James IV.</p>

<p>At the meeting of the Society on January 20th, Rev. E. A. Sydenham gave the
results of his study of the "Coinage of Augustus."</p>

<h3 class="left">THE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p>The passage through Parliament of a new Public Libraries Bill was effected with the
minimum of friction&mdash;one might almost say "of interest." But public libraries, accustomed
as they have been through fifty years to Legislative stonings, can hardly yet
realise that they have in their hands at length the very bread of life. For some, that
statement "renews the unspeakable anguish" of dissolution&mdash;of the day when they
closed their doors to the public from sheer inability to exist. Others may witness to a
miracle of healing, rescue when <i>in extremis</i>. Others, again, survey the newly-granted
means wherewith to end bravely contracted debts. But the majority become slowly
conscious that the burden has fallen from their backs, and that they may go forward
with a lighter step to a far brighter future. The removal of the rate limit will effect a
revolution in public library practice; but its results cannot become at once apparent.
It rests with individual library authorities to make a rate each year&mdash;to afford their
charges the opportunity, as they now possess the power, of proving to all sections of the
public that they are necessities and not luxuries. That some of these Councils will fail
is certain&mdash;the public library idea is not yet sufficiently commended to minds with the
parish pump ideal; and only external pressure and the education of the general public
in library values will bring certain painfully parochial legislators into line with their
opportunities. In London the situation is diverting; one Metropolitan Borough has
awakened rather late to its peril, and like a surprised bather is frantically making for
shore; with a desperate consciousness that close behind is the shark-like shadow of the
London County Council. Other two Boroughs must be in doubt as to whether their
very exiguous libraries, possessed of neither service nor system&mdash;neither use nor ornament&mdash;will
place them out of reach of attack. And, if so, for how long? Other legislation
is foreshadowed, and the Library Association (deeply grateful that the long years
in the wilderness have ended) intends to bring libraries to all the people as a necessary
preliminary to bringing all the people to the libraries.</p>

<p>A correspondent writes of a report in our first issue: "On page 109 you state that
our forty-second annual meeting marked 'a definite cleavage between librarians and the
Board of Education' with respect to future library policy. Here you innocently place
the Association in a false position. The third interim report, the subject of the discussion
to which you refer, was that of a committee appointed by the Ministry of Reconstruction,
and was addressed to that Ministry. The Minister of Education considerately
invited the opinion of the Library Association on that report. The Library Association,
whilst approving certain recommendations contained therein, differed from others,
and submitted a reasoned statement of its views to the Board of Education, as a reply
to Mr. Fisher's request. It is therefore obvious that there is no 'cleavage' between
librarians and the Board of Education; and an incorrect statement to that effect would
give a wrong and damaging impression of the facts. Moreover, the Library Association
is by no means exclusively composed of librarians. A very considerable proportion of
those present at the Southport meeting were members of library authorities, many of
whom were also members of education committees."</p>

<h3 class="left">THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES</h3>

<p>Of the three fragments of Christian art described by Mr. Dalton, one is a spandril
of morse ivory 3 inches long, carved in high relief with two soaring angels back to back.
This fascinating example of the Winchester School of Art dates from about 1000 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>, and
having been found in a garden at St. Cross, is now appropriately housed in the museum
a mile away. The other two are products of the Near East: the first a detail from a
mosaic pavement in a small church of the sixth century at Umm Jerar, south of Gaza,
representing a phœnix on a fire-altar, a rare instance of this motive in early Christian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
times. The other is a marble slab in the British Museum, apparently part of a screen,
from a church at Miafarkin, north-east of Diarbekr, Kurdistan. Dating probably from
the twelfth century, it is carved in low relief on both faces, and a central medallion
bears a double-headed eagle, which had already started on its eventful career. A gift
from Sir John Ramsden has enriched the national collection with a fine example of the
penannular brooch, for a long time in the Breadalbane family. It was probably found
in Scotland, and falls into its place in the series of Irish or Scotic works of art, the date
being towards the end of the eighth century. The material is silver-gilt, with gold filigree
and glass settings; and even the back is ornamented with medallions of trumpet spirals.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE BIBLIOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY</h3>

<p>The occasion of the annual meeting of the Society, which was held on January
19th, was saddened by the recent death of Sir William Osler, the President of the
Society, who had held that office for seven years. During that time he seldom failed to
preside at the Society's meetings, and his courtesy and geniality, no less than his keen
interest in bibliography, and especially in the Society's own sphere of work, won him the
warm regard of the members. For some years past he had been engaged in the preparation
of a monograph on medical works printed in the fifteenth century, which, it is hoped,
will be issued by the Bibliographical Society. Sir William's successor in the Presidency
is Mr. Falconer Madan, formerly Bodley's Librarian. At the January meeting he read
an abridgment of a paper which he had written describing the work of the Daniel
Press, which since the death of its founder and owner has passed into the possession of
the Bodleian Library.</p>

<h2>BOOKS OF THE MONTH</h2>

<h3>POETRY</h3>

<h4 class="left">FLORA. By <span class="smcap">Pamela Bianco</span>. Verses by <span class="smcap">Walter de la Mare</span>. Heinemann.
25<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Miss Bianco is twelve years old&mdash;at least she was when these drawings were made.
There is a sameness about them. Almost all of them contain a rather languishing female
face, with something of a primitive Madonna about it and something (if we dare suggest
it) of the sophisticated 'nineties. In the coloured and in the more elaborate of the
black-and-white pictures the faces are framed in setting of conventional but charming
flowers, with, as Tennyson would put it, here and there a rabbit. The drawings are
unreservedly amazing for a girl of Miss Bianco's age; if her future progress were to be
on a par with her present precocity she would become one of the greatest artists in the
world. We cannot assume that; nor, on the other hand, need we rummage in our notebooks
for ancient generalisations about the fate of ancient prodigies. Miss Bianco is
remarkable now; and she will be what she will be. If we <i>were</i> predicting we should
say that she would become a very skilful and charming decorator, a more complicated
Kate Greenaway.</p>

<p>She has at least performed one great feat already: she has provided little platforms
from which Mr. de la Mare's Pegasus has sprung into the æther. We can imagine nothing
which could more finally illustrate how small suggestions may germinate in a poet's
mind than the verses which Mr. de la Mare has written to these so slight, so purely
decorative pictures. His imagination has been coloured and excited by every smallest
hint of a mood; and where, to the passing observant eye, Miss Bianco has left nothing
more to be said to the little she has stated herself, anything, a droop of the eyelids, an
indicated detail in the background, serves to send Mr. de la Mare off dreaming into remote
fairylands. Behind one of Miss Bianco's damsels, slit-eyed and straight-fingered, is a
path leading to a small crude building. The wind bloweth where it listeth. On this
small thing, missing girl and child and leafy tree, Mr. de la Mare's eye has rested.
The outlines have filled in, atmosphere has trembled in, sounds and lights; and the
outcome is something of which Miss Bianco never dreamed:</p>

<p>The poem <i>Suppose</i>, which appeared in our first number, starts on its fantastic
flight from a face with eyes of wonderment in it; and from another head&mdash;a head
crowned, a neck girdled&mdash;comes <i>The Comb</i>, perfect in itself without any picture:</p>

can fill out an outline that really is given is shown in his delicious poem of <i>Master

scene comes up, country scents, green grasshoppers talking:</p>

<p class="in0">This is an extra number to <i>Peacock Pie</i>, and the poems as a whole make us once more
impatient for a collected volume of Mr. de la Mare's work which will show the bulk
and the quality of the performance of one of the most exquisite artists in words who
has ever contributed to the unequalled treasury of our English lyrics. Nevertheless it
must be admitted that his average level is higher when he is not writing verses to a
series of pictures.</p>

<h4 class="left">SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY ENGLISH VERSE, 1616&ndash;1660. Edited by <span class="smcap">H. J.
Massingham</span>. Macmillan. (Golden Treasury Series.) 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Massingham collects here four hundred poems written, with few exceptions, in
the forty-four years that followed the death of Shakespeare. It may not be correct to
describe this period as the most neglected period of English literature. It is true that
many of the authors and most of the poems to be found in Mr. Massingham's collection
have been ignored by anthologists, and are utterly unknown to the reading public;
but we suspect that the periods of Anne and the Georges have been even less thoroughly
searched, though they would not yield results so rich as those which have come from the
claim that Mr. Massingham has staked out. There were great poets in that period; it
left us many poems by Milton, Herrick, Herbert Vaughan, Cowley, Crashaw, Lovelace
Suckling, and Carew which are familiar to every reader at all interested in English
poetry. Had the obvious best been always selected Mr. Massingham would have found
himself crowded out with stock pieces before he began. He has therefore&mdash;since he
desired mainly to give publicity to the unfamiliar&mdash;left Milton and Herrick out altogether
and excluded some of the best-known poems of their nearest rivals. This has given him
room for everybody, or at least for a hundred and more poets, for Nabbes and Festel,
as well as for the poets above mentioned, for Donne, and for such other respectable
poets as Brome, Bunyan, Cartwright, Corbet, Davenant, Denham, the Fletchers,
Habington, Bishop King, Massinger, Jasper Mayne, Quarles, Randolph, Shirley,
T. Stanley, Traherne, Waller, Wither, and Wotton. It is an imposing array; contemplating
it one realises that if that age could not vie with the Elizabethan in the number
of great works produced, it actually beat it in the number of men it produced who wrote
a few, or many, good short poems. And it had, as Mr. Massingham rightly says, a
quality of its own. It may be difficult to deduce "tendencies" from this mass of
metaphysical, amorous, graceful, jocular, scholarly, tripping verse. But at least the
age was no mere afterglow. There are very few poems in this fine selection which could
have been mistaken for products of any other generation, and there are few which are
mere degenerate imitations of the songs of an earlier race. There was, under Charles
and Cromwell, a distinct civilisation with a colour and a mind of its own; less passionate
(save, in some quarters, in the matter of religion) than the last; less certain in its music;
more self-conscious in all its ways: but genuine and, temperately, ardent, cheerful,
chivalrous, genial, often tender. From the one pole of</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I saw Eternity the other night,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">it covered, in its manner, the whole range of poetic experience and expression, and it
did many things perfectly. Herrick and Vaughan were its typical products, and neither,
in his sphere, has an equal.</p>

<p>We find no material fault in this most admirable and enjoyable anthology. We
may, however, make in passing a few unimportant comments. Mr. Massingham,
as we have said, has covered the ground more exhaustively than we had any
right to expect; and for most of his important omissions he accounts satisfactorily
on the ground that he does not want to reprint poems which everyone already
knows. There are, however, a few things which he might have included. The
selection would have been more thoroughly represented had it contained more
of the controversial element. "I suppose," he says, "that my political temper
would urge me to declare for the Parliament in the Civil War. But a bruising
disunion of feeling would arise were such a choice forced upon me. Before the Civil
War the middle and upper classes in England were highly educated and passionately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
drawn to music. Turning over these old Song-books, printed fifty years after their
Elizabethan prototypes, one feels a horror at the men who violated the temples of
song and learning. For the Puritans killed the musical soul of England and paved the
way for our doom&mdash;the triumph of the business sense." That is as may be: at all events
he who regarded Royalism as the devil would have to admit that, not forgetting Milton
and Marvell, the devil had most of the best tunes; and there is a lilt about many of the
Rump songs that equals anything in English polemic verse. Cleveland, in fancy, might
have been more freely drawn on. Politics apart, there are things missing. A selection
from Joseph Beaumont is given, but where is that beautiful poem about the "sweet
fury" of Mary Magdalen? One poem of the mysterious Anne Collins (it is only, we
think, one edition of her works of which a unique copy is supposed to exist; there was
a second) is given, but not the best. Orinda is done scant justice; and another woman
(not a genius, but as good as some of Mr. Massingham's men) who deserved quotation,
however brief, is Anne Bradstreet, the Tenth Muse, the Female Homer and what not,
of New England. The admission of Philip Ayres, who was twenty years out of date, is
not really justifiable. Granted that he was old-fashioned in style and spirit, the same
might be said of some of his Restoration contemporaries. Dr. Walter Pope's celebrated
poem, for instance, would not have been out of place in a volume which contains Thomas
Jordan and might have contained Martin Parker. A few of Mr. Massingham's copious
and highly entertaining notes invite controversy. It is cruel of him, so tender as a
rule towards small poets who have patches of goodness, to describe Flatman as a
poetaster; it is rash of him to declare that a good Alexandrine <i>must</i> have a noticeable
cæsura; and it must surely have been a moment of aberration which led him to detect
"a superb freedom of imagination" in the ordinary tropes of Lord Herbert's <i>Elegy</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Doth the sun now his light with yours renew?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have waves the curling of your hair?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did you restore unto the sky and air<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The red and white and blue?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have you vouchsafed to flowers since your death<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That sweetest breath?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">These things, however, matter little.</p>

<p>We note, by the way, that Mr. Massingham, like his predecessors, is unable to
contribute anything new to the discussion concerning one of the noblest of the poems
that come under his survey. We refer to "Yet if His Majesty our Sovereign Lord,"
which was discovered by Mr. Bullen in Christ Church Library. Mr. Bullen conjectured
Vaughan as author. Mr. Massingham, with all deference, says that Mr. Bullen is wrong.
We agree with Mr. Massingham; but we should greatly like this problem to be
cleared up.</p>

<h4 class="left">A MISCELLANY OF POETRY&mdash;1919. Edited by <span class="smcap">William Kean Seymour</span>.
Palmer &amp; Hayward. 5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This miscellany "is issued to the public as a truly catholic anthology of contemporary
poetry." We do not quite gather what the author means by this. He has restricted the
range of his selection by printing only poems which have not yet appeared "in book form,"
and he certainly cannot suppose that he has even half of the best living poets in his volume,
or even half of the best poets of the younger generation. Mr. Chesterton appears, but
not Mr. Belloc; Mr. Binyon, but not A. E. or Mr. Yeats; Mr. Davies, but not Mr.
de la Mare; Mr. Sturge Moore, but not Mr. Freeman; Mr. Nichols, but not Mr. Sassoon,
Mr. Graves, or Mr. Turner. Possibly the suggestion is that Mr. Seymour has consulted
other people's tastes as well as his own; this might explain the presence here of poets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
who are not known to have written anything of any merit and who certainly contribute
nothing of merit to this collection.</p>

<p>However, the good things make the book worth having. Chief among them is a long
epistle by Mr. Sturge Moore, which contains pictures as clean-cut and vivid as those
which made his <i>Micah</i> so peculiarly rich a poem. Mr. Chesterton's <i>Ballad of St. Barbara</i>
has glorious lines, and the spirit is the spirit of <i>The White Horse</i>, but ballads should
not be obscure, and this one is. There is no obscurity in Mr. Chesterton's <i>Elegy in a
Country Churchyard</i>:</p>

<p class="in0">The series of lyrics by Mr. Davies are, as usual, delicious, and there is less of rotundity
than usual, and more exactness and feeling, in Mr. John Drinkwater's <i>Malediction</i>.
Mr. Gibson contributes a series of descriptive war-sonnets, adjectival but interesting;
and Mr. Gerald Gould eight sonnets very skilfully written and full of good, if reminiscent,
phrases, which are unfortunately not as intelligible as they look. The editor's
<i>Fruitage</i> is too much like the more pontifical octosyllabics of Mr. Drinkwater, but his
<i>Siesta</i> gives a hot coloured picture vividly. Of the other contributors Mr. Binyon, Miss
Macaulay, Mr. Theodore Maynard, and Mr. Charles Williams (whose <i>Poems of
Conformity</i>, difficult but sinewy, should be better known than they are) are interestingly
represented. To these we may add Mr. F. V. Branford, who has almost made a good
poem out of mathematics. It concludes:</p>

<p class="in0">Obscurity is more excusable in this poem than in his others. The discriminating reader
who has read this book once will probably mark the poems he wants to read a second
time; there are many here by authors who need not be specified which have given
us an uncompensated headache. If the editor means to follow the volume up he would
be well advised next time in being less "catholic" in this regard; an anthology of
contemporary verse has to be almost uniformly good to serve any useful purpose.</p>

<p>Miss Richardson's novel is her fifth volume in the same manner and about the same
person; and a sixth volume is announced. She has apparently in effect only one novel
to write and only one manner in which to do it. It is a manner distinctively her own, and
yet not an isolated phenomenon. This kind of thinking and this kind of writing seem to be
abroad at the moment. There are deep and genuine analogies between Miss Richardson's
style and the style of Mr. James Joyce; there is a much more superficial resemblance
between her work and the <i>fumisterie</i> of Mr. Ronald Firbank. She has influenced
(but in this case it was a conscious discipleship) the method of Miss May Sinclair. It
would not be difficult to find in her traits which she has in common with the more
sincere exponents of Futurist poetry and with the theory an attempt to embody which
was made in Futurist paintings. She is, in fact, an individual member of a school
which is mostly posing and pretence, and which tends to discredit its very few genuine
exponents. But that Miss Richardson is genuine, whether we like reading her books or
not, is a question beyond dispute. She writes as she does because she must, because it
is the way in which it has been given her to write.</p>

<p>It is her object to translate the memories of sensations into words directly and with as
little change as possible. This is a specimen:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Miriam pulled up in front of a large oil-painting over the sofa; its distances&mdash;where a meadow
stream that was wide in the foreground with a stone bridge and a mill-wheel and a cottage
half hidden under huge trees, grew narrow and wound on and on through tiny distant fields
until the scene melted in a soft-toned mist&mdash;held all her early visits to the Brooms in the
Banbury Park days before they had discovered that she did not like sitting with her back to the
fire. She listened eagerly to the busy sounds of the Brooms. Someone had bolted the hall-door
and was scrooping a chair over the tiles to get up and put out the gas. Dust-sheets were
still being flountered in the room behind her. Grace's arm came round her waist.&mdash;I'm so
glad you've come, sweet, she said in her low, steady, shaken tones.&mdash;So am I, said Miriam.&mdash;Isn't
that a jolly picture.&mdash;Yes. It's an awfully good one, you know. It was one of papa's.&mdash;What's
O'Hara doing in the kitchen?&mdash;Taking Grace by the waist, Miriam drew into the
passage, trying to prance with her down the hall. The little kitchen was obscured by an
enormous clothes-horse draped with airing linen. She's left a miserable fire, said Mrs. Philps
from behind the clothes-horse. She hasn't done the saucepans, aunt, scolded Florrie from the
scullery.&mdash;Never mind, we can't have er down now. It's nearly midnight.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">This is the reconstitution of a moment and, for what it is worth, Miss Richardson
makes the moment live again. But minds which observe and record in her close, literal
fashion are not normal minds; and therefore her impressions of life, coloured as they are
by her acute introspectiveness, cannot correspond to life as normal persons see it. The
normal person simplifies life, not merely when, if ever, he describes it, but also when he
perceives it. The world is not to him the fragmentary incoherent whirl of feelings and
events which it is to Miss Richardson. Nevertheless, it is obvious that this <i>is</i> how the world
appears to her; and here, again for what it is worth, is her description of it. With such a
book, a document rather than a novel, the ordinary attitude of the critic of fiction is
naturally unsuitable and inapplicable. He cannot assume the conventional position of
judgment from a definite and unalterable standard. He can, in fact, do no more than
explain what is the book before him and leave it at that. We attempt to do no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
We do, however, think it worth while to establish the fact, if possible, that Miss Richardson's
"novels" are the real expression of a real personality. On some readers they may
have absolutely no effect; on some a small or a transitory effect; some, we know,
appreciate them enormously. But they are genuine; they are not "stunts." When the
series is finished, it may, of course, appear that Miss Richardson has given to the life of
Miriam Henderson an artistic shape and moulding, instead of making it merely an
endless film. But this does not at present suggest itself. What we have now is the record
of a particular mind in various states, a mind which is not normal, but is not possessed to
an abnormal degree of either beauty or power. That, we confess, is all we are able to say.</p>

<p>That Miss Richardson's method is native and genuine may be seen by a comparison
of it with that of Mr. Ronald Firbank, whose <i>Valmouth</i> is worth noticing here in order to
make the point. Here, again, a random specimen is necessary:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Depositing his scrip in the outhouse, the cowherd glanced around:</p>

<p>"Where's Thetis got?" he asked, addressing the small boy, who, brandishing a broken
rhubarb leaf, was flitting functionarily about.</p>

<p>"Thetis?... She's," he hopped, "standing in the river."</p>

<p>"What's she standing there for?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"... Must I thrash you, Billy Jolly?"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't, David."</p>

<p>"Then answer me quick."</p>

<p>"When the tide flows up from Spadder Bay she pretends it binds her to the sea. Where her
sweetheart is. Her b-betrothed.... Away in the glorious tropics."</p>

<p>"'Od! You're a simple one, you are!"</p>

<p>"Me?"</p>

<p>"Aye, you."</p>

<p>"Don't be horrid, David, to me ... you mustn't be. It's bad enough quite without."</p>

<p>"'Od."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Throughout this curious book we have again an attempt at an incoherent and bewildering
style, a picture of a world which disintegrates into a thousand pieces as we regard it.
It is indeed in some sort that deliquescence of language and thought of which a certain
school of French writers once dreamed. But it expresses not a native, if unusual, way of
seeing, so much as a perverse, deliberately assumed attitude. Mr. Firbank has clearly
talents and ingenuity enough to prevent any nonsense he may write being thrown away
as pure nonsense. But it is also clear that his aim is to write nonsense rather than sense
and perhaps to put forward under a film of absurdity a certain natural perversity
which would not be welcomed if it were more lucidly expressed. He has a certain
gift for inconsequence and highly etherealised frivolity; but this may be inextricably
connected with his demerits, in which case it would be useless to ask him to change. If
he does not, he will remain a curiosity, mildly amusing a few readers, deluding a few
into a belief that they have found a super-genius and boring or displeasing the great
majority.</p>

<p>These two books taken together suggest an aspect from which it may be profitable to
consider Mrs. Hamilton's <i>Full Circle</i>. Neither of them tells a story, in the sense in which
the miraculous inventors of the <i>Arabian Nights</i> told stories. Miss Richardson has no
"astonishing history" to recount. She rather describes than tells: though her heroine
moves chronologically, one has yet the sense rather of movement in space than of
movement in time. Mr. Firbank tells some story or other, but it is not possible to discern
it under his incessant saltimbanqueries. Mrs. Hamilton tells a definite tale. Certain
persons enter into relations, find themselves in a situation, resolve it: there is an introduction,
a complication, and a dénouement. It is, however, the story that we miss when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">475</a></span>
we look back on the book. Mrs. Hamilton has observed or imagined certain persons of
various characters and, in order to exhibit them, has invented the shocks and clashes
between them which carry on her narrative. But, while the persons are clearly observed
or imagined, the book suggests that nothing more than invention was used for the
bringing forth of the incidents. The writer might easily have been content to describe
her characters without showing them in motion. The Quihamptons, Iris Mauldeth and
Wilfrid Elstree, are vivid and real, portrayed in the round. We should know them if we
met them; and, from their presentation here, we can make such estimates of and guesses
about them as we make in ordinary life&mdash;they are no less real than that. But in Wilfrid's
affair with Bridget Quihampton, in his disappearance and return, in Roger's marriage
and destiny, it is impossible not to discern a certain lassitude and want of interest.
The incidents are not improbable or ill-drawn; but Mrs. Hamilton cannot have felt very
much about them as incidents. Though the people have undoubtedly come to life in
her hands, they have not proceeded to do anything of their own initiative; except in one
instance, we feel the hand of the author jogging their elbows and ruling their fates.
When two of them, when Bridget and Wilfrid, are involved in an emotional situation, the
author's interest continues to reveal itself in Bridget and in Wilfrid, not in the situation
which the clash of their individualities has produced. A tale need not deal with the
marvellous and fantastic, with genies in bottles and young princes transformed into
calves, in order to exhibit the special gift of the story-teller. It may concern itself with
themes as slight as those of <i>The Spoils of Poynton</i> or <i>What Maisie Knew</i>. But it must at
least deal not with isolated personalities but with that which is produced by the fusion,
whether in love or hate or some other emotion, of two or more personalities, or by the
impact of events on a single personality or more. We do not mean to suggest that Mrs.
Hamilton's novel is deficient in this essential: we mean only that on this side of her
work there are traces of what appeared to us to be lack of interest, even traces of boredom.
In one situation only, in the subtly and mysteriously hinted conflict between Wilfrid
Elstree, the brilliant, untrammelled egoist, and Iris Mauldeth, the pretty girl whose
commonplace character is as rigid as iron, are these traces absent; and here the novelist's
work is done so exceedingly well as to make the deficiencies of the rest especially
noticeable.</p>

<p>Mrs. Beatrice Seymour's novel is also distinguished by one remarkable incident.
It is, we are informed, a first work, and as such it deserves praise for its smoothness and
competence. But in nine parts out of ten it seems to be the attempt of a quite clever
writer to sum up in short space what Mr. Bennett did in the three volumes of the Clayhanger
series, and what Mr. Compton Mackenzie has not yet finished doing in the four
volumes of the Sylvia and Michael series. It describes, that is to say, the separate childhood
and youth of a young man and young woman and then their union, which in this
case is illicit and which is terminated by the war. Much of it is a great deal too up-to-date
to have any depth. Hilary Sargent is a painter, calls Helena Morden "Deirdre" as soon
as he sees her, and, one day when they were together on the Downs, "he read to her
things she knew and things she didn't from de la Mare, Drinkwater, Gould, Hodgson,
and (most appropriately) Hilaire Belloc. And there was Flecker and Brooke and Frances
Cornford and Lady Margaret Sackville; and Dora Sigerson whom Helena loved."
No wonder that, as the reader easily foresees, they lost the last train home; they had
confused their minds with too many styles, and had far too many books to carry. This
kind of modernity is too superficial and too easy of achievement: it is presenting the
reader with false coin. For the rest the book has the slickness and the clicking regularity
which, though they are by no means common in novelists, cannot be of great interest,
except to the subscribers to circulating libraries who are wont to ask for a novel which
will enable them to support the tedium of the week-end. But in one chapter Mrs.
Seymour surprisingly faces and masters a real and a painful situation&mdash;that of a shallow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>
girl who, having rejoiced that her husband at the front enables her to be in the fashion,
collapses under the news that he has been made hideous by injuries received in the
trenches. This is a thing which has undoubtedly happened; it is unspeakably agonising to
contemplate; and, so far as we know, no novelist has hitherto attempted it. But there
is no reason why it should not be used for purposes of art if the novelist has the requisite
skill and tact and, above all, the requisite courage. Mrs. Seymour looks the basilisk in the
eyes and reduces it to her service. The conversation between Helena and Pamela Sand&mdash;it
occupies less than eight pages&mdash;in which the whole affair is begun and ended, projects
violently out of the book, makes the rest of it look rather emptier than it really is, and
testifies unmistakably to the genuine powers which Mrs. Seymour has not elsewhere
employed. One scene does not make a novel, much less a novelist; but one such scene
as this in a first book persuades us to look hopefully to Mrs. Seymour's future.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE CHORUS GIRL AND OTHER STORIES. By <span class="smcap">Anton Tchehov</span>. Chatto
&amp; Windus. 3<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>In the title-story of this volume the injured wife of Nikolay Petrovitch Kolpakov calls
suddenly at the house of Pasha, a chorus-girl, with whom he is accustomed to spend
his time, and Kolpakov, who is there, goes into hiding. He has been ruined by his
extravagances and is on the point of being arrested for embezzlement. His wife demands
the return of the gifts he has lavished on Pasha, in order that the missing sum may be
made up and dishonour averted, but Pasha has had no gifts from him. The wife refuses
to believe it, repeats her demand, and then, without altering her attitude of contemptuous
hatred, implores and entreats. Pasha at last gives her the presents she has received
from more generous admirers. She declares these are not enough and asks for more,
and Pasha gives her everything she has. When his wife has gone, Kolpakov comes out
of his retirement and, expressing his angry remorse that she should have had to kneel to
a "low creature," pushes the girl aside and leaves her. Then</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Pasha lay down and began wailing aloud. She was already regretting her things which she
had given away so impulsively, and her feelings were hurt. She remembered how three years
ago a merchant had beaten her for no sort of reason, and she wailed more loudly than ever.</p></blockquote>

<p>This synopsis suggests, more accurately than any analysis we could attempt in
the space at our disposal, why we should welcome the eighth volume of Mrs.
Constance Garnett's admirable rendering of the tales of Tchehov into English. An
extended study might discover many traits in this author which would be worthy of
observation. There is, for example, the peculiar acuteness of his sense of smell. "The
air was full of the smell of freshly scrubbed floors." ... "As I mounted the soft
carpeted stairs there was, for some reason, a strong smell of india-rubber" ...
a house "was half dark and mysterious and smelt of mushrooms"&mdash;these are sentences
taken at random from two or three stories in the present volume. A minute examination
would reveal other characteristics by which a formal criticism could distinguish Tchehov
from other writers of the short story. But it is doubtful whether any study could come
nearer to defining the nature of his genius than by naming the qualities which are immediately
obvious in <i>The Chorus Girl</i>. He has precision, economy, detachment, and, for
all his gloom and squalor, charm also. He stoops as it were from an ineffable height,
picks up a situation, describes it in the smallest possible number of words, and lets it
fall back into the welter of human lives. It is not likely that any English author will
imitate him, nor would it be desirable, but his qualities, if they cannot be learnt, can
at least be used to correct excesses. And, apart from that, these eight volumes are a
monument of narrative and (for with Mrs. Garnett's translation one can say so much)
of style.</p>

<h3>BELLES-LETTRES AND CRITICISM</h3>

<h4 class="left">THE LONDON VENTURE. By <span class="smcap">Michael Arlen</span>. Heinemann. 4<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It is a little hard to know under what classification this book ought to be considered,
whether fiction, biography, or belles-lettres. The same difficulty has occasionally arisen
with the works of Mr. George Moore. But since the author is alluded to in it by the
name which he acknowledges to be his own, we have decided that it cannot be fiction.
For a reason which has sometimes occurred to the critics of Mr. George Moore, we beg
to be excused from treating it as biography. There remains nothing but belles-lettres.</p>

<p>And Mr. George Moore's name occurs here very appropriately, for not he, not even
Mr. Max Beerbohm, has written anything so characteristically Moore-ish as some of
these pages. Observe how it is done:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>But this letter has seemed strange to me because, perhaps, I shall never again receive a
letter whose writer is dead, and who, when writing it, dreamt of all material things but
death. Were I Oscar Wilde I might wonder now if Englishwomen who die in America come
back to London; for there is much of London in the letter: "I should like to be in London
to-day&mdash;Bloomsbury London, Mayfair London, Chelsea London, London of the small
restaurants and large draughts of wine, London of the intellectual half-lights, drone of
flippant phrases and racy epigrams, with a thin fog outside." ...</p>

<p>... Out of the silence of two years at last came a letter from her. I found it when I
came in very late one night, and for a long time I stood in my little hall and examined the
Eastern stamp and postmark; and the writing on the envelope was so exactly the same as on
the last note she had sent me before leaving England that I had to smile at the idea of
Shelmerdene, in the rush of her last pursuit of her perfect fate, laying in a sufficient store of
her own special nibs to last her for the lifetime she intended to spend abroad; for when I
opened the letter I found that, as I had guessed, she would never come back to England,
saying, "I am a fugitive branch which has at last found its parent tree.... I have run my
perfect fate to earth, Dikran! more perfect than any dream, more lasting than the most
perfect dream." ...</p></blockquote>

<p>Here is the very attitude, here the very cadences of the original; and the adventures
are not dissimilar. Now Mr. Moore has acquired his style by long labour, and it is a little
amusing to see the flower of it culled by a writer who has neither dug nor watered. But
Mr. Arlen will not in so close a discipleship make the best of the talents which the very
closeness of his discipleship shows him to possess. An author who can copy so exactly
the manner of another ought to be able to evolve a manner of his own; and we look
forward to seeing a book in which Mr. Arlen shall have done this.</p>

<h4 class="left">IN THE GARRET. By <span class="smcap">Carl Van Vechten</span>. Knopf.</h4>

<p>Mr. Van Vechten is an American critic, rather of the type of the ingenious Mr. Huneker.
He is quite as fluent, not quite so versatile. No art or aspect of life presents itself to
Mr. Huneker as superior to any other; but Mr. Van Vechten has a great deal more to
say about music than about anything else. He touches the theatre a great deal, literature
a little, and music most of all; and he gulps down greedily all he touches. One name is
as good as another to him and he knows a great many names of all sorts. "George
Moore," he says, apropos of Mr. Moore's suggestion that <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> ought to be
rewritten, "has rewritten many of his own books. Henry James rewrote all of his novels
and tales that he cared to preserve for the definitive edition. On the other hand, Ouida
believed (and expressed this belief in a paper published in her <i>Critical Studies</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
that once a book was given to the public it became a part of life, a part of history, and
that its author had no right to tamper with it." Mr. Ernest Newman likes the operas of
Isaac Albéniz, but Mr. Marliave does not share his enthusiasm. On two opposite pages
we discovered the names of the following persons: Mr. Cabell, Mr. Arthur Machen,
George Sand, M. Maeterlinck, Mr. Cecil Forsythe, Monet, Leonardo, Homer, Rabelais,
Cervantes, Remy de Gourmont, Dickens, Huysmans, and Mr. Havelock Ellis. This
is lively enough in all conscience, and Mr. Van Vechten is able to keep it up without
flagging and to support it with an equal vivacity of style, as when he remarks that the
art of the musician "deals with clang-tints." Modern English criticism is sometimes
reproached with being a little too heavy. Here we have a critic so volatile that he bounces
like a child's balloon from the name of one great man to another.</p>

<h4 class="left">AMONG ITALIAN PEASANTS. By <span class="smcap">Tony Cyriax</span>. Collins. 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The brush rather than the pen is evidently the medium of expression for Mrs. Tony
Cyriax. The pictures in her book convey an infinitely better impression of the life of
the peasant in an Italian mountain-village than all she says about it in writing, which
is rather crude and colourless. But the pictures are delightful, and are sufficiently
praised in an appreciative Introduction by Mr. Muirhead Bone.</p>

<p>The best chapters in the book are those dealing with the tending of silkworms in
peasant cottages, and the greatly dreaded hailstorm which, despite the prayers of the
priest, religious processions, and the ringing of church bells, destroys in an hour the
labour of months and brings the villagers to the verge of starvation.</p>

<p>Such a storm as the writer describes will recall vividly to the memory of any one
who has stayed in an Italian hillside village the pathetic anxiety of the natives when a
thunderstorm is brewing. All around stretch the vineyards, which from dawn till dusk
have been the care of people to whose toil the day's work of an English agricultural
labourer is child's play. Will the hailstones utterly ruin the vines? If so, the
villagers will be faced with semi-starvation, and yet more bread-winners, in despair,
must emigrate to America, that refuge for the Italian destitute.</p>

<p>Pathetic, too, is an account of weeks of unceasing toil in connection with the cottage
silkworm industry. The <i>cavalleri</i> (as the peasants call the silkworms), remorseless in
their greed for mulberry leaves and their demands for the right temperature, will keep
a whole family working for them from morning till night.</p>

<p>Here, as given by Mrs. Tony Cyriax, is the result of the labour of one such household:</p>

<p>"The work from start to finish had covered forty days, and Rosina's cocoons had
weighed fifty-six kilograms ... so Rosina had earned exactly 224 lire, which is
all but £9."</p>

<p>As a record of the hard existence that may be passed in the midst of Nature's
graciousness and beauty <i>Among Italian Peasants</i> is not without value.</p>

<h4 class="left">SUSSEX IN BYGONE DAYS: Reminiscences of Nathaniel Paine Blaker, M.R.C.S.
Hove, Combridges. 1919. 5<i>s.</i></h4>

<p>The recorders of Sussex must have a shelf to themselves by this time, and there are
many reasons for it. Sussex has not only individual quality, amenity and interest: all
counties have them. But it is accessible, and it is the fashion. Not to go back to Dallaway
and his likes, the best of the moderns are Mr. Lucas and Mr. Halsham, and the better of
them Mr. Lucas, as we think. He has the mellower outlook, a benevolent, postprandial
regard. Mr. Halsham is more pedagogical; he regrets much, and seldom approves.
He cannot praise a landscape without reminding us how much better it was before old
What's-his-name cut down those trees. Taken at some length&mdash;indeed, taken in series&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>he
becomes tiresome. Nevertheless, he wrote a novel once, called <i>Kitty Fairhall</i>,
which contains more of the essence of the Sussex peasant than Mr. Lucas himself is
likely to apprehend.</p>

<p>Mr. Nathaniel Blaker, the latest chronicler, earns a place upon the shelf the rather
because it need only be a little one. Our quarrel with him would be that it did not ask a
larger. He has lived long and served his county honourably in an honourable profession;
but he has not much to say. That is a pity. He has stored his mind, but cannot load his
page. He remembers mail-coaches, he remembers the ox-teams, he remembers the days
of reaping with the sickle, the foot-high stubbles, the threshing with a flail. To some of
us those memories have a savour so sharp that, with the wind, one might catch and
transfigure it in words. To Mr. Blaker they are as the primrose was to Mr. Bell, and one
feels that he puts them down rather because that is the kind of thing one does put down
in books of this sort than because they import a perfume which it is luxury to distil
upon the page. Lacking gusto, Mr. Blaker tantalises his reader. The beautiful names
which he strews about him&mdash;Selmesten, Steyning, Hurstpierpoint, Ringmer, Fulking&mdash;flicker
like a mirage. He tells us, for example, that Steyning Fair in the old days "was
a scene of great excitement and confusion, and probably as much iniquity as could be
crowded into so small a space." We dare say so; but we are athirst for the iniquities,
and he gives us none to drink of. One wishes to get Mr. Blaker by the fire with a matured
cigar, and ply him with questions. Gypsies now. Obviously he knows a great deal about
them. He says, "I well recollect, very many years ago, one rainy afternoon, which
prevented them working, watching a family of gypsies in a barn. I think the family
must have consisted of the father and mother and several children, one daughter nearly
grown up, and two or three acquaintances. They all sat or lay about upon the straw,
doing absolutely nothing, while one or two girls kept singing a peculiarly plaintive
and monotonous but soothing and agreeable tune in a language, I believe, I did not
know, for I could not catch a single word." That is the sort of thing Mr. Blaker will do
with a pen in his hand&mdash;give us the materials of a picture and leave us burning. His
"broken hinted sights" do but sting the mind.</p>

<p>Of course he tells us&mdash;he can't help it&mdash;some interesting things. One of them is "a
common saying that Sussex girls had such long legs because they stretched them by
pulling them out of the mud." That must have been in the Weald&mdash;but we did not know
that feature of Sussex girls. Cobbett knew, and so do we, that they are remarkable for
their good looks. Mr. Blaker does not say so. We regret his Peter Bell attitude to life.
His best chapters are upon the horse and the birch, with both of which he is evidently
acquainted. "It used to be considered," he says, "a great joke when a lady's first baby
arrived to send her a carefully packed parcel containing a small birch rod, with a label,
'To be used when required.'" That is what we want. And, again, he says that "it was
the custom when the cloth was laid for dinner in the middle of the day, for the cane,
which was kept over the mantel ... to be placed with the carving-knife and steel on
papa's right hand." Excellent. These scraps show what a handsome sack of oddments
Mr. Blaker must have. He should have shaken it more liberally over his book.</p>

<h4 class="left">A PILGRIM IN PALESTINE AFTER ITS DELIVERANCE. By <span class="smcap">John Finley</span>.
Chapman &amp; Hall. 10<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Of Mr. Finley's sincerity and enthusiasm there can be no question: of his taste there is
a good deal to be said. Many books have been written about the Holy Land; but surely
none before which deliberately puts the history and the personages of Palestine into the
background of a picture whose foreground is occupied with the events of the recent
campaign. Mr. Finley has no hesitation in viewing sacred history <i>sub specie temporis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
hodierni</i>. For him Allenby's battle at Armageddon is "the beginning of the end of the
battle with the Beast." The German is not, however, only Anti-Christ: he is also Judas.
Here are Mr. Finley's meditations over the Holy City:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I was an ashamed spectator, standing there at the Gethsemane Gate, feeling that we had
been sleeping when we should have been watching, when we should have been preparing for
defence against the German Judas who had professed devotion to the teachings of Him who
spoke the Sermon on the Mount. Did not the great German Hospice stand most conspicuously
on the Mount, that its pilgrims might dip their bread in the very sop of the Master's
dish? And do not the towers of the German churches stand out most prominently (and
offensively) in the Inner City?</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Most of his book is like that: and if you cannot see history in quite the startling black-and-white
of Mr. Finley's imagination you had better leave the book unread. Mr.
Finley was with the American Red Cross, and he tells one happy story of himself, which
it is only fair to quote. He was worshipping in the Russian Church of the Ascension on
the Mount of Olives:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A woman of sharp, eager face, as of a zealot, with a grey shawl over her head, seeing me
standing near the door, approached me and said, in rather sharp voice, "Quelle croix?"
I did not at first understand the import of her inquiry, though I realised that she was putting
to me an all-important question: "Quelle croix?&mdash;grecque ou latine?" ... My
answer was "La Croix Rouge."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">If the soil of Palestine be favourable for legends, no doubt a tale will arise of a strange
religion whose devotees cross themselves neither in the Western or Eastern manner,
but in some strange, "red" mode which Mr. Finley's zealot was probably eager to see.</p>

<h4 class="left">ADDRESSES IN AMERICA. By <span class="smcap">John Galsworthy</span>. Heinemann. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Generalisation, which used to be a philosophy, is rapidly becoming little more than a
hobby. During the war it was a hobby savagely or amiably ridden by those who sought
to explain the mentality of the Allies or the Enemy. Gradually individuals learnt that
not every Belgian was Belgium, nor every German Germany: but for propaganda
purposes we still used great typical figures. It saved thought, and it flattered either our
own pride or that of our friends. The propagandists' most delicate task was always to
explain Great Britain to the United States of America: and certainly it was a wise
thing to send Mr. Galsworthy across the Atlantic. Surely he, if anyone, might be able
to justify the ways of the country house to Boston and New York, to Washington and
even to Chicago. Here we have his addresses delivered during 1919 in the United States.
In his paper on America and Britain he takes the line that by words we are saved:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The tie of language is all-powerful&mdash;for language is the food formative of minds. Why
a volume could be written on the formation of character by literary humour alone.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It sounds not unconvincing, until one remembers that French is not the language of
Alsace; that English is spoken by most of the inhabitants of Ireland; or, to go further
back, that the possession of a common language did not prevent Athens and Sparta from
indulging in the Peloponnesian War.</p>

<p>We like Mr. Galsworthy better when he leaves his generalisations and tells stories.
In the paper "Tallary at Large" he displays that sweet-naturedness, that mellowed
irony which never lapses into satire, that humour which is always aware that a sense of
pity is invaluable in comedy. Here is the true Galsworthy:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the fifth year of the war two men sat alone in a railway carriage. One pale, young,
and rather worn, had an unlighted cigarette in his mouth. The other elderly, prosperous,
and of a ruddy countenance, was smoking a large cigar. The young man, who looked as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
his days were strenuous, took his unlighted cigarette from his mouth, gazed at it, searched
his pockets, and looked at the elderly man, and said, ... "Could you give me a
light, sir?" The elderly man regarded him for a moment, dropped his eyelids, and murmured:
"I've no matches." The young man sighed, mumbled the cigarette on his watering
lips, then said very suddenly: "Perhaps you'll very kindly give me a light from your cigar,
sir." The elderly man moved throughout his body as if something very sacred had been
thrilled within him. "I'd rather not," he said, "if you don't mind." A quarter of an hour
passed, while the young man's cigarette grew moister, and the elder man's cigar shorter.
Then the latter stirred, took it from under his grey moustache, looked critically at it, held it
out a little way towards the other with the side which was least burned-down foremost, and
said: "Unless you'd like to take it from the edge."</p></blockquote>

<p>This book is beautifully printed on admirable paper, and is priced very low. Unfortunately
Mr. Locker Lampson has reached middle life without learning that most
platitudes are better unwritten. "No man is a hero to his own valet, and the same
principle may be applied as in part the cause of our invidious comparisons between the
men of yesterday and those of to-day." "He alone has a right to be called successful who
has led a happy life." Sometimes he will enliven his platitude by a pleasing derangement
of metaphors. "Autobiographies are of little value in extending the personality of their
authors. We may get an occasional glimpse below the surface, but the waters are generally
agitated by all kinds of subsidiary motives, and the eye cannot pierce them." The
one sentence which explains the author is to be found in the essay <i>One's Own Company</i>:
"No man, then, need ever be bored by himself, although he cannot avoid being bored
by others."</p>

<h4 class="left">DOMUS DOLORIS. By <span class="smcap">W. Compton Leith</span>. The Bodley Head. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>In the unornamental language, from which even the loftiest intelligence may extract
apt expression for itself, this little book may be called a collection of thoughts in hospital
from a patient's standpoint, and an impression of the various nurses who attended him.
And yet such a description is unjust and utterly beside the point. The publisher's note
upon the cover tells us that Mr. Leith has "a rare sense of the value of words and the
beauty of phrases," and there is no doubt of it. But the value to literature and humanity
of phrases which are but the vehicles of their own intrinsic beauty is to be questioned.
The whole essay is precious in the last degree.</p>

<p>"Oblivion flowed up like evening gloom. Life moved with it to the edge of a great
deep; it was drawn over; it floated down and down, wound in the arms of sleep."</p>

<p>"A faint awareness stole into being, like the grey of morning; then a sense of movement;
but whether it was a coming up and forth, or a declining, there was no power
to tell."</p>

<p>This sort of thing, exquisite as it may be sometimes, constantly reminds us, however,
and with relief, that Henley, with simplicity and humour, covered the same ground in
verse. From time to time an unpretentious passage comes to us with a shock, and we ask
ourselves again and again, if, as it seems, the writer has opinions to air, observations
about life and death to make, what especial virtue there is in the high-falutin obscurity
of his expression. One of the chief and most necessary concealments of art lies in a
well-simulated nonchalance to the more obvious kind of purple patch. Here the entire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
robe is of purple, though certainty of a royal shade. There were voices, Mr. Leith tells
us on the first page (and it was not until the fifteenth that we knew where the voices
came from), which "kept thought strained after a meaning." A light strain is no doubt
good for thought; but in reading this book it is not light: and it is hard to say which
strain is the more severe&mdash;the student's for meaning or the author's for effect.</p>

<p>Nowhere in England, nor even in Ireland or Scotland, could the life pictured in this
book be paralleled. Feudalism has lingered, but not in delicate or decorative ways:
in the Brittany of which Miss Sedgwick tells us, the beauty, the generous abundance,
and the sincere brotherliness of life almost overcome one's distaste for the feudal system
which formed its basis. The lady whose childhood is shown us was of a noble Breton
family; her father seems to have been the only Republican she knew among the company
of Royalists; life was still so ordered that the country people, coming to Mass, would
bow to the lord and lady of the manor, after paying their respects to the altar. Yet one is
left with a sense of fraternity as genuine as that one feels in reading Chaucer, as the
story witnesses:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One peasant, I remember, Paul Simur by name, of whom my father was specially fond,
was so dirty and unwashed that a sort of mark of dirt had formed upon his features. One
day, at a hunting-party, papa called to Paul to come and sit beside him, and the other huntsmen,
with singular bad taste, began to make fun of Paul, who sat much abashed, with hanging
head. Papa affectionately laid an arm about his neck and defended him, until his friends
finally cried out that they wagered he would not kiss him. At this, although he confessed
afterwards to the most intense repugnance, he at once kissed Paul heartily. Poor Paul was
quite overcome. He came to my father afterwards with tears in his eyes and said, standing
before him and gazing at him: "<i>Oh, mon maître, que je t'aime!</i>"</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Although the accounts of old Breton customs&mdash;the glimpse at the Folgoat pardon, the
gently critical analysis of the lives of the gentry, the sidelights on the peasants, their
cooking and their cottages&mdash;are all full of interest, the book is chiefly to be valued for
preserving the fragrance of an order of living which too many of us are apt to think of
as one of harsh tyranny alleviated by wanton luxury.</p>

<h3>HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<h4 class="left">THE LIFE OF THOMAS COUTTS, BANKER. By <span class="smcap">Ernest Hartley Coleridge</span>.
2 Vols. Lane. 42<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Thomas Coutts, virtual founder of the Bank of his name as it now is, was born in 1735,
and, according to the standards of Scotland, well born, having, that is, wise, reputable
forbears, relatives with place-names of their own&mdash;Stuarts of Allanbank and the like&mdash;and
a coat-of-arms. "Instead of which," as the old story has it, at the age of twenty-eight
he married his mother's nursemaid, and loved and served her faithfully until,
after some fifty years' partnership, she wandered out of her mind and then out of his
world. By that time his three daughters by her had married, one an Earl of Guilford,
one a Marquis of Bute, and one Sir Francis Burdett. By that time also Coutts was one of
the most considerable bankers in London, and one of the richest men in England. It
might now be thought that his adventures in life were over&mdash;but not at all. At seventy
years of age he stepped once more into the <i>Pays du Tendre</i>, and took into his protection&mdash;which
in his case, it really appears, had no secondary meaning&mdash;Miss Harriot Mellon, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
low comedy actress of abundant charm, humble birth, little education, and excellent
disposition. She was then twenty-eight. He fell headlong in love with her and head
over heels. He endowed her with stock and other movables to the amount of £500 a year,
and when, at the age of eighty, he made her his second wife he settled the whole of that
endowment upon herself. At his death, Mr. Coleridge tells us, her private fortune could
not have been less than £200,000. Notwithstanding the estrangement and unconcealed
disgust of "the ladies," as he always called his daughters, she made him perfectly
happy for nine years; and when, at eighty-nine, he died, very reasonably, he left her
practically everything he possessed.</p>

<p>That in outline is the life-history of Thomas Coutts as Mr. Ernest Coleridge pleasantly
and ably narrates it in two portly volumes. The book offers a view of eighteenth-century
manners which is not often, and seldom so well, illustrated. Coutts must have
been, and he was, a notable man of affairs; but he was a good deal better than that.
He knew, of course, everybody who was anybody. He was the friend and
correspondent of Lord Bute, the favourite of Lord Chatham, of William Pitt.
He lent, <i>mero motu ejus</i>, £10,000 to Charles Fox without security of any kind.
He lent large sums to the Duchess of Devonshire, and forwent the interest until such
time as her son was pleased to pay it; for her husband never would. He lectured that
great and gay lady upon her follies with perfect freedom and no result. All the royal
rips, sons of George III., banked with him, or, in other words, borrowed from him;
and they dined with him too. Edward Duke of Kent, the only one of them who
was not a rip, made a friend of him as well as a convenience. It is interesting to
remark how Coutts deals with these disreputable magnates. He is respectful of their
degree in so far as he is shopkeeper and they customers; but outside the bank-parlour he
stands on level terms. His children are to commence with their children; his wife's
table is as good as their tables. Servant-girl or not, his wife, Mrs. Coutts, is the equal of
their wives. There is nothing of Sir Pertinax MacSycophant in his letters, although,
as a trader, he continually has his eye upon business, and is never above doing himself a
good turn. Mr. Coleridge is to be congratulated upon having presented so engaging a
picture of the sound, cautious, and upright Scots merchant, who kept his head and his
balance through the convulsions of the American and French wars, and cultivated the
domestic virtues in the same social set as Old Q. and the Duchess of Gordon.</p>

<p>But, except for that sappy core of romance which twice betrayed itself in act and once
in word, Tom Coutts was a dry stick. While his views of political affairs were sound and
uncommonly independent, his expression of them was not interesting. He was by
inheritance a Tory, yet he was staunch upon the American war. "The idea," he wrote
in 1775 to Lord Stair, "of reducing such a continent to obedience (especially after
letting them have so much time to unite) appears to me, so far as I am capable of judging,
to be absolutely impossible." So, too, he opposed the war with revolutionary France.
"The war made against their growth seems to me to be exactly the way to encourage
instead of destroying them. There is no instance of opposition by force of arms subduing
opinions! which by such manners have always grown stronger and more inveterate."
One might be reading the present Dean of St. Paul's. The same faculty of seeing things
as they really were allowed him to have no good opinion of Pitt's Reform proposals of
1784, and gave him as early as 1785 a plan of dealing with Irish disaffection which was in
fact adopted in 1800, to our cost. "As to Ireland, I apprehend it is an aristocracy of
about thirty nobles, etc., who command two hundred votes in the Lower House, and
that these thirty may be bought and a union accomplished more easily than that heap
of nonsense called the Irish propositions." They <i>were</i> bought.</p>

<p>Mr. Coleridge prints a recently discovered bundle of his love-letters to Harriot
Mellon, from which, if one could feel love-letters to be fair game, it would be tempting,
and easy, to make extracts. They are striking by their extraordinary difference from his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
other familiar correspondence. Coutts becomes emotional, profuse, sentimental, and
occasionally ridiculous. Few love-letters, however, will stand the test of examination in
cold blood. It can be said of his at least that there is nothing in them which is not
intended to honour the recipient. To Coutts his Harriot was a pattern of womanly
virtue. It is Mr. Coleridge's opinion, as it is our own, that she deserved it. That she
made him happy is obvious; that she returned him a grateful love let this, which was
written by herself five years after her wedding-day, bear witness:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"I never lose my spirits." My blessed Tom said these words to me in a dream. After he
had kissed me and laid his dear head on my bosom, I felt his tears on my cheek&mdash;I was so
happy, but so melancholy happy. He looked so well, tranquil and divine.... I see him at
this moment, upright, beautiful and composed, as in his long and immaculate life. He looks
just as I first saw his dear, blessed face upwards of twenty years ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>That is both tenderly and prettily said. Tom Coutts, in his marriage as in other
things, knew what he was about.</p>

<p>"La Turquie est le pays classique du massacres," it has been truly said.... "Son
historie se résume à ceci: pillages, meurtres, vols, concussions&mdash;sur toutes les échilles&mdash;révoltes,
insurrections, répercussions, guerres étrangères, guerres civiles, révolutions,
contre-révolutions, séditions, mutineries." All these things are the theme of Mr. Allen's
interesting and well-written sketch of the Turkish power, from the rise of Osman in
the thirteenth century down to the Treaty of Bukarest in 1913. Mr. Allen does not,
however, confine himself to a mere record of horrors. He contrives throughout his book
to draw in a few lines the characters of the chief actors in the drama, and, especially in
the later chapters, to expose the policies, European and Turkish, which have created
and complicated the long nightmare of the Near East. Many of our troubles of the last
forty years are attributed by him to the Treaty of Berlin in 1878, the triumph of Lord
Beaconsfield's policy. It was a treaty concluded, he says, "in a spirit of shameless
bargain, with a sublime disregard of elementary ethics, and in open contempt of the
right of civilised peoples to determine their own future. It was essentially a temporary
arrangement concluded between rival Imperialist States." A few years later the "grim
raw races" in the Balkans were again in a savage ferment, and we could enjoy "the
spectacle of the heads of the civilised world, in their palaces in the capitals of Europe,
setting those same 'grim raw races' to kill." Mr. Allen in his narrative of this later period
does not spare his criticism of the diabolic diplomacy of Berlin and Vienna, of the
brilliant cunning of their agents in Turkey&mdash;and notably Baron Marschal von Bieberstein.</p>

<h4 class="left">ST. CATHERINE OF SIENA. By <span class="smcap">Alfred W. Pollard</span>. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson.
3<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>In this little volume, one of a series called <i>Messages of the Saints</i>, Mr. Pollard has re-told
the ever-fascinating story of St. Catherine, Siena's fourteenth-century saint. "In the
present sketch," says the author, "there is nothing original, save possibly its point of
view and (I believe) the chapter on St. Catherine's book."</p>

<p>Its point of view is that of an ardent if critical admirer of St. Catherine, and full
justice is done to what after all are the qualities which made of her not only the most
lovable, but perhaps the most amazing of saintly women. <i>Amor vincit omnia</i> is the
motto which springs to the mind as most fit for Catherine of Siena. In an age of cruelty
she is love personified. It was love for her fellow-creatures, concern for their immortal
welfare, that led her, a poor ignorant "little bit of a woman," to face with the simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
of a child and the wisdom born of simplicity princes and popes, and force them, not
to her own will, but to what she conceived to be the Will of God.</p>

<p>To all who have lived long enough in Siena, Catherine becomes a living personality.
So real indeed that it would scarcely be surprising to meet her one evening at dusk in
that long steep street&mdash;still the street of the tanners&mdash;where six hundred years ago she
walked with her lantern on her way to the sick and dying during the plague. In Siena
one is apt to forget that St. Catherine was a figure in politics and the composer of a
book about which the learned dispute. Still, on the day of her festival the townsfolk
sing the "Praise of Catherine," to them merely the tanner's daughter who, greatly to
the glory of their beautiful little city, somehow became a saint.</p>

<p>Mr. Pollard's chapter on the <i>Libro della Divina Dottrina</i>, the treatise said to have been
dictated by St. Catherine while in a trance, is valuable because it summarises typical
pronouncements of the mystic upon the various stages of the soul in its pilgrimage
towards a spiritual goal.</p>

<p>As a revelation of the subconscious self, if for no other reason, St. Catherine's book
has its own intense interest. Those who are already familiar with her story may, by the
help of Mr. Pollard's pleasant sketch, refresh their memory of its details, and to those
who are not it should, as he hopes, prove a stimulating introduction to the life of a
wonderful woman.</p>

<h4 class="left">VICTORIAN RECOLLECTIONS. By <span class="smcap">J. H. Bridges</span>. Bell. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Bridges deliberately adopts the attitude of the <i>laudator temporis acti se puero</i>. The
worst of this prose is that, just as it may attract the sympathy of men of his own generation,
it inevitably repels slightly those of a younger. Nothing is more tiresome than to
listen to judgments on life and manners whose chief point lies in the opening words,
"Well, I tell you in 185&mdash;we did not," or "we did"&mdash;such criticism automatically
provokes the retort, "Well, this isn't 185&mdash;," whereat your ancient growls, "I would
to God it were," and youth and eld stand back to uncomfortable back, with no chance
of doing any useful work.</p>

<p>Fortunately Mr. Bridges, although angry at the modern depreciation of things
Victorian, is better than his threat. He is not too comparative, and although overfond of
censure, his blame has a humorous quality which keeps it inoffensive. At times the
humour is unconscious, as in Mr. Bridges' charming suggestion that the beauty of the
primrose is more noticed and "more respected" because ardent Tory enthusiasm
associated Peter Bell's flower with the late Lord Beaconsfield: but Mr. Bridges' essentially
"pawky" quality of mind&mdash;we use the word in an amiable sense&mdash;crops out not
infrequently as, for instance, in his grave statement that he would be "in favour of a
law forbidding anyone to own more than 150 newspapers."</p>

<p>Mr. Bridges gives an account of his schooldays under a flogging master, which adds
yet another count to the indictment against Victorian methods of education. He does
not tell us much that is unfamiliar, either of Eton or Oxford, though many will be glad to
have his description of the old-time Don, and the Dean Gaisford's letter to a noble father
who enquired after his son's University progress:</p>

<p class="sigright">
<span class="l8">"My Lord, Such letters give much trouble to</span><br />
<span class="l6">"Your humble servant,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">The Dean of Christ Church.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>In the late fifties Mr. Bridges visited Canada and the United States, and he records his
conviction that Senator Douglas was Lincoln's "superior as speaker and politician,"
a verdict which makes one wonder a little what his standards of oratory are, and how a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
politician, obviously inferior in moral character, who also fails to keep his country's
confidence can be called the inferior of one who wins its trust. Mr. Bridges abandoned
his plan to settle in the New World, and returned to England and started farming, first
in the Eastern counties and subsequently in Shropshire. In the chapters dealing with
his life in rural England he sketches some village types for the reader with a genuine
feeling for character. Particularly good is the final chapter, "A Survival," with its
touching picture of Old Tom, "the last survivor hereabouts of the old-style agricultural
labourer." Whatever one's political colour, one cannot help sympathising with Mr.
Bridges and Old Tom in their lament at the decay of rural England, and at the growth
of conditions which made it possible for "more and more people to wax rich in London
and in the big towns, while no one can earn a living in the country." Though the latter
ceased to be true during the war, one is yet uncertain how far the prosperity then enjoyed
by the farmer will continue as war conditions slowly depart.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE LIFE OF LIZA LEHMANN. By <span class="smcap">Herself</span>. T. Fisher Unwin. 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Born in London, daughter of a Scotswoman, educated in Italy, married to an Englishman,
Liza Lehmann's heart&mdash;and she was a woman who always let her heart rule her
head&mdash;was unconsciously fixed in England. Yet as we turn the pages of her autobiography
there is hardly one in which we do not feel conscious that she belonged by
unalterable temperament to the land of <i>Die Gartenlaube</i> and <i>Familie Buchholz</i>. Many
English singers and audiences in the happy days before the war have felt that for all
their devotion to Schumann, the domestic intimacies of <i>Frauenliebe und Leben</i> were too
intensely German for an English sense of proportion and sense of humour. Let them
read <i>The Life of Liza Lehmann</i> in their own tongue, and they will turn with relief to
the reticence and dignity of Chamisso's lyrics. It is evident that she was a woman who
never did an act, never cherished a thought, that was not a kind one. She collaborated
in an opera with Mr. Laurence Housman; he considered that she had wrecked his play,
she thought that he had wrecked her music; but she records the awkward incident without
the least trace of ill-will, nay, without the least supposition that he or anyone else in
the world could have borne ill-will to her. Liszt, Brahms, Browning, and Verdi were
among her acquaintances; but she has little to tell us about them. They counted for far
less in her life than Madame Clara Butt, Mr. Kennerley Rumford, Mr. Arthur Boosey,
and Mr. Landon Ronald; and even these were unsubstantial shadows compared to
her mother, her husband, and her sons. A large proportion of her book is taken up with
newspaper criticisms and interviews, mostly American. They gave the authoress no little
pleasure, and they will give the reader no little amusement; indeed, as studies of
American literary style, they are most instructive. The final chapter, dealing with the
death of her elder son, so shortly to be followed by her own, can hardly be touched upon
in a review; it seems an intrusion to read it.</p>

<p>The story of the paravane, the remarkable anti-submarine contrivance invented by
Commander Burney and used by the Allied navies and also by merchant ships during
the later period of the war, is told by Mr. Cope Cornford in a popular style and with
considerable enthusiasm. It is possible that he is over-enthusiastic, for in a prefatory
note he tells us that some naval officers and also the Admiralty consider that he exaggerates
the effects of the paravane. There is no doubt, however, as the official figures themselves
show, that paravanes and "Otters" (as they were called when fitted to merchant
vessels) did have an enormous success. The total tonnage of H.M. ships and merchant
ships definitely saved by them comes to over a quarter of a million; and the financial
saving to the British Empire is estimated at approximately £100,000,000. Mr. Cope
Cornford has a good deal of criticism&mdash;some open and more, we think, implied&mdash;to
make against the Admiralty. Exactly how far it is justified we cannot say; but there are
certainly a good many people with inside knowledge who assert that the Admiralty were
decidedly cold about the paravane, even if they did not actually "crab" it. And the
rewards and honours bestowed on the brilliant young officers who devoted themselves
to the paravane and Otter services were not particularly generous.</p>

net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Domville-Fife's purpose is to discuss the importance of the submarine arm in
naval warfare of the future. His treatment of the subject is very balanced and his
conclusions are cautious. He gives us a great deal of interesting information about the
history of submarine craft (beginning as far back as 1578) and of the submarine
explosive mine. In dealing with the tactics of submarines and their influence in naval
strategy, he speaks as an expert; for not only has he devoted many years to their study,
but during the war he was in command of anti-submarine craft and an instructor at
H.M. School of Submarine Mining. The economic influence of the submarine on
this country, Mr. Domville thinks, is summed up in the words of Lord Selborne in
1915: "After the war the whole question of our agricultural and economic policy of
the food production at home will have to be revised in the light of our submarine
experience." But what of the League of Nations? Are we not entitled to voice our
views of the future of naval warfare in the light of that? Here Mr. Domville-Fife is
guarded. He looks forward "steadfastly and even hopefully towards the vivid dawn
of a new era." But he is not for abandoning the old motto, <i>Si vis pacem para bellum</i>.</p>

<p>These two books must rank among the most important documents yet produced which
bear upon the antecedents and the consequences of the war in so far as British policy
is involved. Lord Haldane was for many years War Minister, and during the critical
period of Anglo-German relations he was also a sort of supplementary Foreign Secretary
whose influence over the most important department of Foreign Affairs was very great,
partly because of the weight his opinion carried with Sir Edward Grey and Mr. Asquith,
and partly because of his special knowledge of Germans and Germany. His book has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
a double subject as it has a double object. He outlines the main elements and the principal
stages in our policy <i>versus</i> Germany before the war, and he sketches what was done
during his administration to perfect the organisation of our Army. He defends our
national policy (there are interesting sidelights thrown by his personal experiences
with the Emperor and among the governing classes of Prussia) on the ground that we
did the best we could when we combined an earnest effort to prevent war with a resolution
to be ready for it; and in his personal apologia he argues, in effect, that in the
circumstances (we must not forget that the nation as a whole, and Parliament in
particular, viewed military expenditure with a very jealous eye) his régime did the
utmost that could have been expected. It is now commonly conceded, even by those who
distrusted Lord Haldane's views in foreign affairs, and those who were bitterly against
him because of his refusal to adopt universal military service, that he did a great work
at the War Office. What he says about the efficiency of his Expeditionary Force ("If
the warrior looked slender he was at least as well prepared for the ring as science could
make him") must be universally admitted; and with his great work in that department
must be coupled the creation of the Territorial Force. On the point of compulsory
service Lord Haldane defends himself by saying that in 1912 the General Staff was
allowed to investigate "the question whether we could or could not raise a great army."
"The outcome was embodied in a report made to me by Lord Nicholson, himself a
soldier who had a strong desire for compulsory service and a large army. He reported,
as the result of a prolonged and careful investigation, that, alike as regarded officers
and as regarded buildings and equipment, the conclusion of the General Staff was that
it would be in a high degree unwise to try, during the period of unrest on the Continent,
to commence a new military system." We might have become "seriously weaker before
we had a chance of becoming stronger," and an enemy might have sprung on us. "I
quite agreed, and not the less because it was highly improbable that the country would
have looked at anything of the sort." We imagine that the one thing which should (in
the light of our subsequent experience) have been done and was not done (though lack
of money would have been a severe limitation to the actual accumulation of large stores,
whether of rifles or of clothing) was to prepare a scheme whereunder the material for a
greatly expanded force would be easily and rapidly obtained immediately an emergency
had arisen.</p>

<p>Lord Haldane has many interesting <i>obiter dicta</i>. He insists on the need (never more
necessary than now) for politicians to understand the meaning of the words they use,
and the nature of the main conceptions which are entertained by the nation, and those
which dominate their own minds. He says that his opinion of the German people
remains unchanged. "They were very much like our own people, except in one thing.
This was that they were trained simply to obey, and to carry out whatever they were
told by their rulers. I used, during numerous unofficial tours in Germany, to wander
about incognito, and to smoke and drink beer with the peasants whenever I could get the
chance. What impressed me was the little part they had in directing their own government,
and the little they knew about what it was doing." Lord Haldane dates this
habit of mind back to the days of Frederick the Great; but is there not something to be
said for the view that it is to be traced back through the period of the religious wars
into the baronial Middle Ages?</p>

<p>Lord Haldane's conclusion is that "the question is not one simply of the letter of a
treaty, but is one of the spirit in which it is made.... The foundations of a peace that is
to be enduring must, therefore, be sought in what is highest and most abiding in human
nature." These sentiments are eloquently supported by Mr. Maynard Keynes, who
resigned his position at the Peace Conference (where he represented the Treasury)
because he felt that the negotiations were not being inspired by that spirit and by those
high and abiding ideals. His argument, which is supported by very acute reasoning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
is that the economic clauses of the Treaty threaten the ruin of our interlocked economic
civilisation; and, with the skill of an artist, he strengthens the gloom of his tale by giving
in introductory chapters a tragic setting: a concourse of statesmen, oblivious of the
greatness of the issues involved, men of mechanical or cunning minds, men obstinate
and narrow, ruthless and cynical, adroit and cunning, intriguing, hoodwinking, whilst
their world was rolling towards the precipice. The issues he considers, the arguments
he advances, are far too controversial to be entered into here: but it is a book which
states one point of view far more powerfully than it has been stated anywhere else and,
as such, should be read, if only to be answered. We take it that beyond the public
questions which engage the author's mind there must have been a personal one (which
is also, however, a public one) which must have caused him much disquiet: the question
how far a civil servant, whilst the events under discussion are still in progress, is
morally entitled to divulge things he would not have seen save in his official capacity.
He may&mdash;this we suppose is beyond dispute&mdash;resign and conduct argument on the
basis of facts known to the public; but should he watch statesmen at private assemblies,
judge their characters by what he sees there, and then come out and attempt to blow
them sky-high? We suppose that Mr. Keynes, who is no doubt convinced that his
estimates are sound and that the whole future of the world may depend upon people
realising what he believes to be the truth, would say that there was a conflict of obligations,
and that the larger one had overcome the lesser. But we do think that there is
room here for investigation and definition by a political philosopher with some practical
experience. The problem is not a simple one.</p>

<h4 class="left">A HANDBOOK OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS. By <span class="smcap">Sir Geoffrey Butler</span>.
With an Introduction by Lord Robert Cecil. Longmans. 5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<h4 class="p0 left">THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE LEAGUE. By <span class="smcap">Eustace Percy</span>. Hodder &amp;
Stoughton. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It would hardly be possible to find two more different books on the same subject than
these two. Hence it is extraordinarily instructive to read them together. Sir Geoffrey
Butler is an academic international lawyer, a lecturer in International Law and Diplomacy
in the University of Cambridge. He is therefore well qualified for the task which
he has undertaken, a short and elementary treatise, "which tries to place the League
in its historical perspective." He traces the history of international relations and shows
that the League is a development of the idea of a Concert of Europe as opposed to the
idea of a Balance of Power. He then explains the constitution and machinery of the
League as it appears in the Paris Covenant, gives the text of the Covenant, and adds a
commentary or explanation of its various clauses. Sir Geoffrey does not possess a light
or facile pen, and occasionally his meaning is singularly obscure. The book is academically
cautious and unoriginal, but it sticks to its object, which is to explain the kind of
international instrument which the victorious statesmen fashioned in Paris. Hence it
will be useful to those who do not possess technical knowledge but wish to understand
the significance of the clauses, or bare bones, of the Covenant.</p>

<p>Lord Eustace Percy is not concerned with bare bones, but with the flesh and blood
which may or may not one day clothe the skeleton which the victorious Powers produced
at Paris. No one could call the author or his book cautious; they are always trying to
get back to fundamentals. To Lord Eustace the Covenant of the League is a "revolution,"
and he endeavours to show the revolution in British policy which it implies&mdash;the
ultimate, fundamental responsibilities which, with the signature of the Covenant, the
nation and its statesmen assumed. In order to do this, he not only examines the League
and Covenant; he gives a most interesting account of the previous international position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
and policy of Britain, the United States, and the chief Continental Powers; he analyses
and criticises the terms of the Paris peace treaties; he deals with Labour unrest; the
epidemic of revolution, Bolshevism. The whole forms a restless, brilliant, and often
paradoxical essay on international relations. Its great merit is that the natural reaction
to it in the reader is thought. It is true that the author's own political thinking is
frequently much less deep than it would appear to be on a cursory examination; but at
least if he cannot himself go to any great depths, he always tries to go as deep as he can,
and he carries his reader below the obvious surface of political platitudes. His method
is to appear at first to go almost to the extreme limits of "progressiveness" and unorthodoxy,
and then, by the help of a paradox, to double on his tracks and to show that after
all the "progressives" are out of date, and nothing much could have been done other
than has been done. Thus he begins by writing about such terms of the Peace as the
Saar, the Balkans and Austria, Shantung, the Adriatic, and the economic clauses, in
language which we might expect from the extreme Left, and then, when the reader is
beginning to feel that he has been robbed of his last illusion, he is headed back from
despair with the paradox that "in a sense, the strength of the Treaty lies in its weakest
parts&mdash;in those provisions which are the least workable in practice."</p>

<p>For some tastes there will be too much of this kind of paradox in this book. Lord
Eustace is, perhaps, at his best when he is dealing either with past history or with the
immediate subject of his book, the Responsibilities of the League. The League, in his
view, is "the one novel contribution made to the settlement by the Conference at
Paris"; it creates the conditions and machinery necessary if the family of nations is to
realise a "policy of joint responsibilities," and to deal continuously in a spirit of friendly
co-operation with "the standing common interests of nations." This thesis is explained,
worked out, and illustrated with very great ability. Lord Eustace obviously considers
that those who framed the Covenant produced the best international framework and
machinery which at the moment it was possible for practical statesmanship to produce.
Those who expected or asked for more are, in his opinion, impractical idealists, or,
what is worse, they do not see that the whole object of the League is to continue and
develop the existing international system of absolutely sovereign States. His treatment
of this extremely difficult and important question of sovereignty is the least satisfactory
part of his handling of the League. He holds that the doctrine of communal society
"applied to the League of Nations clearly rules out first of all any encroachment upon
the sovereignty of its members." But sovereignty does not consist solely, as he seems
to imply, in "the claim of the State against any of its members," and surely the League
might limit or "encroach upon" the sovereignty of its members without necessarily
creating a Super-State. It is a pity that Lord Eustace has not dealt more thoroughly with
this question, for it is vital to another important opinion held by him, namely, that
the League must be the enemy of and bulwark against Bolshevik or Communist
Governments.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. By <span class="smcap">J. Ramsay Macdonald</span>. Swarthmore
Press. 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This is not a mere list of criticisms and reminiscences written by a carpet-bagger.
Mr. Macdonald was in India as a member of the last Public Services Commission.
He has studied numerous official and unofficial books and documents, and has met
and heard the views of representatives of all classes and schools of political thought.
He has stayed with Provincial Governors, Indian leaders, district officers, and heads of
native institutions, such as the Gurukul of Hardwar and the Rabindranath Tagore
school at Bholpur.</p>

<p>The result is a book of great interest, written with an insight and moderation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
will commend it to many who do not agree with all its conclusions. It was written, Mr.
Macdonald tells us, before the Montagu-Chelmsford Report was published; but it is
none the worse for this. References and comments on the Report have been added, and
every line may be read with profit alike by the extreme reformer, the moderate constitutionalist
and the firm conservative.</p>

<p>Mr. Macdonald begins with an account of the rise of Nationalism and a sketch of the
history of European penetration and the advance of the East India Company in India.
This enables the British reader at once to understand the remainder of the book, and
places him in possession of a store of knowledge which may help to foster that interest
in India and her problems so lacking in British electors and politicians alike.</p>

<p>The pronouncement of August, 1917, the Montagu-Chelmsford Report, and the
passing of the Government of India Act of 1919 are first steps towards the
establishment of self-government for India; but the real difficulty to be solved is the
representation of the mass of the people. Mr. Macdonald holds that "The
democratic forms of the West are not the only forms in which democracy can take
shape.... India is not a nation of equal citizens so much as an organisation
of co-operating social functions." The question of diversity of race and language will
remain even when primary education has become general, and Mr. Macdonald might
have made clearer his views of the lines on which genuine popular representation can
be secured. He does, indeed, in his account of the 50,000,000 "outcastes" of India give
us a dim vision of his hopes that with education will come leaders of ability to represent
them; but this does not solve the main problem of ascertaining and giving expression
to the will of the people. With the Councils and reformed administration India will be
somewhat in the position of England in 1832, and whether she is to develop under
British tutelage, or to be left to work out her own salvation under her own bourgeois
Government, is a question which statesmen will be called on to decide in the near
future.</p>

<p>The chapters on finance and on religion and Nationalism are among the best in the
book, while the pithy accounts of the ceaseless toil of a Lieutenant-Governor and of a
District Officer should disabuse the minds of those who have been accustomed to
regard Indian civilians as comfortable overpaid loafers.</p>

<h4 class="p0 left">THE CHEMISTRY OF COLLOIDS. By <span class="smcap">Richard Zsigmondy</span>. John Wiley &amp;
Sons and Chapman &amp; Hall. 13<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Colloid chemistry, for which Dr. Wolfgang Ostwald claims to have established the right
"to existence as a separate and independent science," is a study of very recent development,
which has come to its own during the past twenty years. In many respects its development
offers a close parallel to that of catalysis, a branch of chemistry recently noticed
in these columns. In both cases we have a few brilliant, isolated studies, succeeded by
a long period during which little attention was paid to the subject; in both cases this
century has seen a large body of chemists, especially the younger men, attracted to the
investigation, the phenomena in question, and results have been rapidly attained which
have proved of great theoretical interest, and have already found wide application in
industry. Just as the old idea that there were a few special catalysts has been succeeded
by the belief now held that every substance can be made to act as a catalyst in suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
circumstances, so it is now stated freely that, instead of there being a small class of
colloids, any substance can be prepared in a colloid state. Incidentally, colloidal preparations
are widely used as catalysts.</p>

<p>Colloid chemistry may be said to have arisen some fifty years ago in the researches of
Thomas Graham, who showed that a large class of liquids or semi-liquids would not
diffuse through animal membranes, as do ordinary solutions of salts. Because many of
these substances were sticky he gave to the whole class the name which they now hold,
colloid. Since then his conception has been extended, and it is now realised that, strictly
speaking, we should talk rather of a substance in a colloidal state than of a colloid, since
typically crystalline substances, such as ordinary salt, can be prepared in colloidal
solution. The characteristic of such a solution is the fineness of sub-division&mdash;the
dispersion&mdash;of the "dissolved" substance. In a true solution, in the ordinary sense,
we have, in general, the substance existing as separate molecules dispersed throughout
the solvent. In a mechanical suspension, such as may be prepared from exceedingly fine
sand and water, the suspended particles, which take some time to settle, can be easily
seen with a microscope, if not with the naked eye. In between these two classes of dispersed
systems we have solutions in which the particles, while consisting, in general, of
a very large number of molecules, are small enough to pass through filter-paper and
escape the ordinary microscope, while at the same time they do not diffuse through
membranes and can be seen by special optical arrangements, <i>i.e.</i>, the so-called ultramicroscope.
Such dispersed systems are colloidal systems, which have only recently
been investigated in detail, although Faraday prepared colloidal solutions of metallic
gold which still exist. Colloidal chemistry has been picturesquely called "the world of
neglected dimensions," which is appropriate enough. Of course the exact degree of
dispersion which constitutes a colloidal solution is purely arbitrary, since, as Wolfgang
Ostwald&mdash;the son of Wilhelm Ostwald&mdash;insists in the book before us, solutions are
known which show all ranges of sub-division of the dissolved substance, from molecular
dimensions to visible particles. Various distinguishing tests have led to solutions in
which the diameter of the particles lies anywhere between a millionth and a thousandth
of a millimetre being conventionally called colloids.</p>

<p>The scientific, industrial, and medical applications of colloid chemistry increase in
number daily&mdash;we are already confronted with the word colloidotherapy&mdash;and there is a
growing demand for books on the subject. The two before us are each by authors who
are celebrated for their researches in the subject: Zsigmondy invented the ultramicroscope,
which has been responsible for the most important recent advances in the study
of colloidal solution, and Wolfgang Ostwald has added clearness to nearly every branch
of the subject. Ostwald's book, adequately translated by Dr. Martin Fischer (although,
we may remark, the word "enormity" is not generally used as a synonym for hugeness),
is based on a series of lectures given by him in America just before the war. Publication
has been delayed by the war, and it is interesting to note that in the preface, written in
1915 when Germany was apparently in a good position, the author looks to science to
form the first bridge between the peoples then at war, and exclaims, "How should I,
for example, cease to admire, to adopt, and to develop the labours of a W. B. Hardy,
a W. M. Bayliss, a J. Perrin, a P. P. von Weimarn, and others, just because they belong
to a people hostile to my own?" The book gives a most excellent sketch of the whole
field, by one who is an enthusiast in his subject, and may be thoroughly recommended as
an introduction for those who are beginners, even if their general knowledge of chemistry
is slight, while even the expert will find much in it to interest him. As a detail we may
mention that Ostwald gives a quick receipt for the preparation of red colloidal gold with
ordinary distilled water, while other authors, including Zsigmondy, insist that the
preparation is a delicate undertaking, requiring specially distilled water and the greatest
care. The wonderful range of phenomena now included in the subject is clearly brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
out, and the pictures of Liesegang rings and the ultramicroscopic photograph of a
setting cement are beautiful. The treatment of gels, the jelly-like form into which
certain colloidal solutions pass, is particularly good, and gives much valuable information
not hitherto available in popular form. The last two chapters, or lectures, on scientific
applications and technical applications of colloid chemistry are of surpassing interest,
as indicating the practical importance which this young science has attained. All life
processes take place in a colloid system, and the necessity to physiologists of the study of
colloids is forcibly emphasised. Rubber milk, or later, is a colloid, so that all the problems
of coagulation of rubber and its subsequent vulcanisation are included in the subject.
The setting of cements is a colloidal problem. These, and many other questions, are
briefly but clearly discussed. The experiments which accompanied the lectures are
described, and are most suggestive.</p>

<p>Professor Zsigmondy's book is more technical, and deals mainly with "hydrosols"
and "hydrogels." The author's reputation in this field vouches for the excellence of the
treatment of the many expert problems discussed. Naturally the subjects of ultramicroscopy
and protective colloids are discussed in detail&mdash;the author originated the "gold
figure" used to express the protective effect of a colloid. The theoretical discussions
are particularly valuable, and physiologists will read with interest the long discussion
of protein bodies. There is an appendix on industrial colloid chemistry by the translator,
Dr. Ellwood Spear, in which the problems of rubber manufacture, tanning, and other
industrial processes are very briefly treated. There is in this section a chapter on smoke
abatement, but the methods mentioned scarcely fall within the province of colloid
chemistry as generally understood. A final chapter, by Dr. J. F. Norton, deals with the
application of colloid chemistry to sanitation.</p>

<h4 class="left">MODERN SCIENCE AND MATERIALISM. By <span class="smcap">Hugh Elliot</span>. Longmans.
Green &amp; Co. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This book is an exposition of monism, the philosophic theory that asserts the identical
nature of mind and matter, as distinct from the dualistic "superstition"&mdash;as our author
terms it&mdash;of matter and spirit. Sir Oliver Lodge, in a recent article, claims that three
fundamental things are required to explain our universe: viz., Mind, with its rudiment
Life; Matter, with its element the electric charge; and Ether, with its fundamental
properties equivalent to elasticity and inertia. Mr. Elliot will have none of this. For him
there is no reason to postulate other things than those capable of investigation by
physical science&mdash;the ether and matter are essentially of the same kind, while all the
phenomena of life are, if not at present explained on a physico-chemical basis, yet
ultimately explicable in terms of the exact sciences. Life is a name for certain properties
of protoplasm, and the chemical reactions of life are more complicated, but not more
mysterious, than those of the laboratory. As for "ghosts, gods, souls, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>,"
our author holds that "these have long been rejected from the belief of most advanced
thinkers." He traverses the assertion of Professors Mach and Karl Pearson, that while
science can explain "how" things occur it cannot explain "why" (the point
under discussion depends, of course, on Mr. Elliot's interpretations of the words), he
pours scorn upon Herbert Spencer, Bergson, and all the vitalists. Altogether the book
is one of the most pugnacious defences of monism which we have read, and will delight
the bitter opponents of all spiritualistic philosophies. At the same time the author
maintains that his philosophy is not materialistic, in the ordinary sense, but a form of
idealism, and this, of course, is true, in a way, of any form of monism, it being possible
either to say that the atom of matter is as full of mystery as life, or that life is as full of
mechanism as the atom. It is obviously impossible in the limited space at our disposal
to criticise the arguments put forward on a subject so complicated and controversial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
but we think that nobody will admit Mr. Elliot to be as unbiassed as he appears to
consider himself, judging by his remarks on the bias of the vitalists. His claim for the
support of the physiologists reminds us that Dr. J. S. Haldane recently opened a discussion
on the question, "Are Physical, Biological and Physiological Categories Irreducible?"
by a pronouncement in the affirmative; the physicists also are not all monists.
The question is more two-sided than our author will admit. His science is unfortunately
by no means beyond reproach: to say that the charge on the electron is "inconceivably
immense" is either extraordinary inaccuracy of phrase or extraordinary error, while to
state that the electron has weight is to assert something of which we have no experimental
evidence. That light is a vibrating motion of the same character as sound is incorrect,
and such instances can be multiplied. These things are not of fundamental importance
to Mr. Elliot's argument, but they show, to say the least, a deplorable looseness of
expression. Nevertheless, the book is worth reading to all interested, either as friends
or enemies, in the monistic philosophy, and may lead some of those who talk so freely
of souls and mind to be a little more precise as to what they mean by these terms.</p>

Buchanan</span>. Cambridge University Press. 21<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Selections from the papers of the author have already appeared under the titles of
<i>Scientific Papers (Oceanographical)</i> and <i>Comptes Rendus of Observation and Reasoning</i>.
This third volume, with an English modification of the title of the latter work, continues
the plan of that book. The papers are very varied in character, including chemical
studies, accounts of physical determinations, addresses on geography and oceanography,
more technical geographical writings, and short articles on topics of general interest,
reprinted from <i>Nature</i>, the <i>Times</i>, and other periodicals. Many of the latter recall
events of our generation important, but already half forgotten, such as the stranding of
the <i>Sultan</i> and the wreck of <i>Santos Dumont 6</i>. An excellent feature of the author's
<i>Comptes Rendus</i> was the detailed summary, with page references, provided for every
article, and the same plan is followed in this work. The author's work on oceanography
is too well known to need commendation&mdash;he was chemist and physicist to the
<i>Challenger</i> expedition. His "Retrospect," the second article in the book, gives a fascinating
summary of the work done on that expedition, and the other papers on oceanographical
subjects are of great general interest, and incidentally recall the great services of the
Prince of Monaco to that science. His general outlook, which lends such freshness to all
his writings, cannot be better expressed than in his own words in a former book: "It
was conveyed to me through an old friend and former colleague that this contribution<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">... had done much to retard the standardisation of research. I took it as a compliment.</span><br />
To standardise research is to limit its freedom and to impede discovery. Originality and
independence are the characteristics of genuine research, and it is stultified by the
acceptance of standards and by the recognition of authority."</p>

<p>It throws much light on the recent increase in the expenses of publishing that, whereas
the <i>Comptes Rendus</i> was published in 1917 at 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, the present volume of similar size
and form is published at 21<i>s.</i></p>

it may be used for pictorial broadsides or for book illustration. It
concerns us here as a means&mdash;I wonder if I ought not to write the means?&mdash;of book
illustration. Notwithstanding the great technical advances made in line and half-tone
photo-process engraving, there is a tendency to return to the use of the woodcut for
certain kinds of catalogue illustrations, and, to a still greater extent, for book illustration
and decoration.</p>

<p>The half-tone process involves the use of so-called "art" paper, <i>i.e.</i>, a wood pulp or
grass pulp paper as a centre, coated over with kaolin or china clay, with a high finish,
the glazed polish of which reflects the light very unpleasantly. This objectionable paper,
apart from the incongruity of wash drawings or photographs with typography, relegates
this method of book illustration to utilitarian ends. The line process is far preferable for
book illustration, but in itself it has no pleasant quality, usually very much the reverse,
and pen drawings are no more directly suitable for book illustration than pen lettering
is for use with type. The woodcut modifies the character of the drawing with a discipline
which produces a character more in sympathy with that which type has acquired at
the hands of the punch-cutter and type-founder in its passage from writing; and the
same discipline modifies the artist's vision as well as the drawing. Material, too, has its
own character, and when the user is not too clever this character becomes active in the
work, not merely passive. The wood block itself can contribute a valuable quality, and
either the knife or the graver is a responsive tool. The corresponding elements in line
process work are the zinc plate and etching acid, and they do contribute something
of their quality to the work; but it is not an attractive quality.</p>

<p>The rediscovered qualities of the wood block have attracted many artists to its use.
They are producing work of great variety of interest, but it is rather in the pictorial
direction than as book illustration. The work of Valloton elsewhere, and of Jane Bouquet
and Brangwyn, of Sydney Lee and Verpilleux in this <i>Studio</i> special number are examples
of this. The work of Lucien Pissaro, of Charles Shannon, and Charles Ricketts shows the
right use of the woodcut as decorative illustration, but their work belongs to the early
days of this revival. Dürer, Holbein, and the Polyphilus printed by Aldus are the great
exemplars for a pre-Bewick Brotherhood of the decorative woodcut. Where work of a
freer quality is desirable, Miss Jackson's on page 13 shows the texture that goes with
type satisfactorily. Miss Gribble has given the right degree of formal treatment to the
pastoral motives she has chosen for tail-pieces, and makes them decorative without
letting them lose their interest and so become vapid conventions. Both Miss Jackson
and Miss Gribble are pupils of Mr. Noel Rooke, who has done so much for the right use
of the woodcut for decorative illustration.</p>

<p>The lithographs suffer much more than the woodcuts by reproduction. To begin
with, they are very much reduced in size, and they are printed by a letterpress method
(<i>i.e.</i>, from a relief surface) instead of from the plain surface for which they were drawn.
The loss which they suffer by these changes can only be appreciated by those who know
the originals. Both Mr. and Mrs. Hartrick's fine examples suffer through the loss of the
rich lithographic black.</p>

<h2>DRAMA</h2>

<h3>CHILDREN'S PLAYS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> hold of the Pantomime on the affections of the public is possibly as strong
as ever it was, but the character of those entertainments has been slowly
changing and with it the character of the audience. Professedly I suppose
the Pantomimes are for children, but except that almost any entertainment
will amuse children, owing to their extreme curiosity, there is little in the
modern Pantomime that seems to have been devised for them. In fact, the Christmas
Pantomime has of late years come to have a particularly sophisticated and adult savour,
which is to be noticed in the treatment of the old fairy-tales&mdash;one or other of which, in
name at least, still forms the basis of every Christmas Pantomime, although in a shape
that would scarcely be recognised by the compilers of <i>Grimm's Fairy Tales</i>.</p>

<p>This is particularly noticeable in the metamorphosis of the Witch who, fatigued by
the possession of mysteriously terrible powers, dwindles into the obscene-faced mother-in-law.
The sere old woman who turned the seven white-horsed princesses into low
stones, over which the moss crept slowly, has become a gin-inoculated Widow Twankey,
who dances like a man and gloats over the highly-successful love-affairs of her son as
leading to more and better drink.</p>

<p>Pantomimes have always been less concerned with the imaginative, the more-than-human,
than with the extraordinarily actual. Some will remember the artillery bombardment
which was introduced one Christmas during the war into a Pantomime at Drury
Lane, which was, if I remember rightly, superficially the story of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>.
It was good fun that bombardment, much better fun than are the majority of these
topical excrescences, but one felt that it had been introduced because the principal
comedian had got bored with the comparative sober quietness of that land of imagination
in which the inhabitants of a fairy-tale progress as if seen in a glass darkly. He had,
therefore, deliberately pulled the story out of its semi-supernatural country into the
limelight, and was rewarded by instant mirth and vociferous applause from nine-tenths
of the audience. Only a few children hesitated, feeling the pangs of a violent up-rooting,
a being torn out of a land, through which they had been slowly but with intense delight
travelling, into a mass of gesticulating faces ranged in circles watching the elaborate and
apparently comic contortions of two small grotesque figures on what was obviously the
stage.</p>

<p>I have no doubt at all that the instincts and judgment of children in these matters is
far superior to that of the majority of their elders. The steady vulgarisation in the theatre
of fairy-tales originally the inventions of adult minds of phantasy and sensibility superior
to the general is a record of the debasing influence of the mass of the inhabitants of our
large cities, who are dissatisfied with less than an instant reaction to the efforts of those
whom they pay to amuse them. They are too restless to submit to sit quietly and by slow
degrees receive the heritage of beauty accumulated by the ambages of minds whose
devious and amazed wanderings are like the apparently directionless perambulation of
bees who are, without pause, gathering honey.</p>

<p><i>Sinbad the Sailor</i>, <i>Aladdin</i>, <i>Ali Baba</i>&mdash;whatever they be, the essence of these Pantomimes
is something grosser than any fairy-tale, and, whether borrowed from the brothers
Grimm, or Andersen, or any other source, their fragile and mysterious beauty is roughly
obliterated to give place to an obvious rough-and-tumble humour and crude topicality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
of the kind that not one in a million could miss. Of course the somewhat "hearty"
atmosphere of Christmas-time is not conducive to fineness of vision. The subtler outlines
in which resides the beauty of a fairy-tale, a girl, or a mountain are not to be
grasped by eyes slightly dazzled with the inner glow of good feeding&mdash;that glow which
has more heat than light. It is a time when a joke has to be obvious to be seen, and the
propensity to enormous girth perceptible in the most popular characters of Pantomime
may have a similar origin; but I speak from a painful experience when I declare that for
a Christmas Pantomime nothing can be too crude, too stale, too trivial to be funny,
and that the best condition in which to go to the Pantomime would be that in which you
could see simultaneously the largest number of Moons.</p>

<h4 class="left">The Change in the Pantomime</h4>

<p>The Pantomime has become a sort of Christmas Revue, and parents in large numbers
have ceased taking their children to these entertainments, appealing as they almost
exclusively do to the "grown-up." In their place we have had of late years a large
number of children's plays, of which Sir James Barrie's <i>Peter Pan</i> is the best known.
It is years since I saw <i>Peter Pan</i>, but I was, I remember, greatly taken with it, and went
during that season five or six times. Part of the attraction it had for me lay in the charming
personality of Peter himself, as played by Miss Pauline Chase, whose postcard
portraits I bought in large numbers and gazed on adoringly for long intervals in the
seclusion of my own room. But the very fact that the play gave scope to a young actress
to embody a figure of such originality and charm as Peter must be accounted as a virtue
in the author.</p>

<p>I know there are people who object to fairy-tales. They have lately been greatly
cheered by the public confession of Madame Montessori that she belongs to them.
Apparently the essence of their and also of her objection to such seemingly innocent
and delightful inventions of the human brain is that the most desperate need of children
is for a steady inculcation of facts. Having schooled your child in facts&mdash;writes in a
letter to the <i>Observer</i> the gentleman who knows the Secret of Human Power&mdash;in the
pleasantest manner possible up to the age of, say, sixteen, then the lessons to be derived
from fiction may be gently and cautiously dealt with. The spectacle of an adult dealing
"gently and cautiously" with a fairy-tale is one of those which seem to have been
invented as a subject for a Max Beerbohm cartoon; but it is curious that anyone should
have such a narrow conception of reality as to think that it is compassed in material
facts. How one is to present love, honour, bravery, beauty, virtue, daring, adventurousness,
and all the other qualities of the human mind except by imaginative creation,
when they are purely creations of men's minds, I cannot see. Perhaps these deluded
realists imagine that they are abstract nouns. They would have us say: "Here, dear
children, are a number of abstract nouns; contemplate them as you would marbles, but
remember that they are not marbles or even peanuts but nouns. You cannot play with
them, you cannot eat them, and what good they are nobody knows, but everybody is
supposed to know their names, as there is no other way of distinguishing them one from
another." This same champion of Madame Montessori's Anti-Fairy-Tale Campaign
writes further in his letter to the <i>Observer</i> that Shakespeare's plays "were not written
specially for children, but as morality incentives distinctly for adults." This is a pitiful
notion for any intelligent adult to have, and one that no child with a mind not distorted
by unnatural virtue could be expected to understand. It is most expressive of that
horrible "seriousness" which seizes some minds like a cramp until the sufferer drowns
himself in an ocean of blithering nonsense, refusing all the ropes which the onlookers on
<i>terra firma</i> throw him, because their faces are convulsed with laughter. "Morality
incentives"&mdash;to cling to the shocking expression of Madame Montessori's disciple&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>are
of two kinds. They are either negative or positive. The negative class is the only one
that an Anti-Fairy-Tale League could put in its syllabus. It consists of a series of
ejaculations: Do not drink! Do not swear! Do not tell lies! etc. Drawn up in an
amended form suitable for children, it might read like this:</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
(1) Do not drink your brother's ginger-beer.<br />
(2) and (3), etc. Do not imitate your parents.<br />
</p>

<p>It may appear excellent advice, but virtue&mdash;as many religious teachers have suspected
and modern science is proving&mdash;does not reside in turning oneself into a van-load of
inhibitions. Virtue is wholly positive, it is an expression of the spirit. He that imagines
virtue is virtuous, and no other. It is a fairy-tale that men are trying to live in the
world, and it can only be expressed in art. There is no virtue in a mere exhortation to
be virtuous. Nobody takes any notice of exhortations, and quite rightly; but men who
have seen a vision will try to capture it. What the creative artist does is to give men a
vision of virtue, of beauty (for beauty is virtue), and it is just this vision which the
Montessori teachers would have us put behind the backs of children while they glue
their eyes to material things.</p>

<p>Not only would this practice be pernicious, it would be impossible to carry out, for,
brought to its logical conclusion, the theory would demand the abolition of the teaching
of mathematics and of science, as well as of poetry and of drama; or rather it would
reduce mathematics to the counting of beads, science to the naming of smells (a return
to "stinks" from which the schools are just escaping), poetry to this sort of thing:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Last night in pulling off a sock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I gave my little nose a knock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day in jumping to get up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fell across my brindle pup.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">That is to say, poetry would vanish, and as for drama, the only drama we could have
would be by taking a proscenium into the park and putting it up in front of two lovers
kissing on a seat; but the moment the lovers saw us the "drama" would cease, and we
could not pay them to go on with it for our amusement, for that would be deception,
that would be make-believe.</p>

<p>Those of us who are not by infirmity of constitution natural victims to every new
fad that is advertised will take pleasure in anticipating a great growth in the supply of
and demand for children's plays. They offer great scope for development, and will
increasingly appeal to authors who have no desire to write the conventional stage play&mdash;a
thing without imagination or beauty, a mere artificial contrivance to enable actors to
exhibit their charm and skill. There is no possibility of getting literary men of the highest
class to write the plays we see succeeding in our London theatres during the greater part
of the year. They could not possibly have any interest in work of that kind, and they
could not do it well, but the children's play is a much more elastic and adaptable
dramatic form. To-day, for instance, even verse is used in successful children's plays,
and managers do not demand for this purpose work so conventional and stereotyped
as they require ordinarily. This Christmas there were three children's plays produced
in the West End: <i>Peter Pan</i>, <i>Once Upon a Time</i>, and <i>Where the Rainbow Ends</i>. Of these
only <i>Once Upon a Time</i> was new, and it was rather a series of fairy-tales&mdash;connected by
the device of an elf telling the stories to a goblin who captured her&mdash;than an original
work; but it was cleverly done by the author, Miss Wildig, and delightfully produced
by Miss Edith Craig. I must confess to having enjoyed <i>Once Upon a Time</i> far more
than most of the plays I had seen during the preceding year, but it was a pastiche not a
homogeneous invention, and it contained an absurd and very irritating pseudo-patriotic
melodrama called <i>The Woman of the Black Mountain</i>, as well as an extremely amusing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
and rather savage burlesque of certain marriage customs which are not yet quite
extinct entitled <i>The Bone of Contention</i>. This latter would make an excellent sketch for
a Revue, or possibly Mr. Oscar Asche will introduce it into <i>Chu Chin Chow</i>.</p>

<h4 class="left">Demand and Supply</h4>

<p>It is a great pity that the Pantomime has so degenerated now when it had got rid of
much of the knock-about farcical element, of a great deal of the tyranny of the spectacular,
and of the "transformation scene," because it is a form that offers great possibilities
to the author, and if a genius came along he could do something wonderful
with it. Even without a genius or without waiting for him a great deal could be done.
If only those responsible for the annual Pantomimes at Drury Lane and the Lyceum
would leave the beaten track for once and get into touch with the younger generation
of writers and commission them to produce a Pantomime we might get a valuable
addition to our dramatic literature. It involves very little commercial risk, and holds
the possibility of an immense financial success, apart from other considerations. It
may be asked why do not these young men write a Pantomime on their own initiative?
But the answer is simple. Our young writers have no time to spend on work which has
no prospect of ever being looked at, much less produced; besides, a Pantomime is
essentially a thing for collaboration between two or three of them, and they are nearly
all as busy as they can be with bread-and-butter journalism and with individual projects
in those few spare hours that remain to them. There is, however, little doubt that they
could produce a Pantomime which would draw all London for months, just as there is
little doubt that the Pantomime and the children's play are the most promising and
flexible of the dramatic forms which confront our young writers. The Revue may be
thought to offer almost equal opportunities, and to be capable of development out of
its present chaotic state, but it is rather more restricted by the fact that it has such a
large public. To have the largest public is to have the least hope of commanding the
attention of your audience sufficiently for them to appreciate what is not obvious.
Besides, the Revue supplies a definite demand which does not change from year to
year. It is a demand for pretty girls, pretty dresses, dancing and humour, and if there
suddenly appeared among us a greater dramatic genius than any that has ever lived he
would not be able to satisfy that demand as well as Mr. C. B. Cochran, Mr. André
Charlot, or Sir Alfred Butt do. It is the minority that is not catered for in drama as it is
catered for in literature. Where are the thirty-five thousand readers of the <i>Times Literary
Supplement</i> in the land of theatres? They are scattered in twos and threes here and
there, always dissatisfied and disgruntled. Whether at a Pantomime, at a Revue, at a
Comedy, or at a Drama they find the entertainment a hundred per cent. below the
standard they demand, and their only pleasure is an occasional Shakespearean production
or a children's play. But they could be mobilised and brought together to support
solidly and without the fickleness of the large public a theatre that gave them what
they wanted. If the experiment were made with children's plays they would be
reinforced by the thousands of parents who will not submit their children to the
vulgarities of the latter-day Pantomime.</p>

<h3>DRAMATIC LITERATURE</h3>

<h4 class="left">PROBLEMS OF THE ACTOR. By <span class="smcap">Louis Calvert</span>. Simpkin. 7<i>s.</i></h4>

<p>This is a book which can be thoroughly recommended not only to every amateur
but to every professional actor and theatre-lover. It is full of the most uncommon sense,
and although Mr. Calvert has decided opinions on voice-training, gesture, team-work,
scenery, dressing, music, and producing, he does not lay down the law with the evidence
of inexperience, but reasons his position from point to point with a quietness that is far
more impressive and convincing. Mr. Calvert has also done more than he probably set
out to do. The book is, in the first instance, a guide for the young actor or would-be
actor, giving him a good deal of wise advice on the technical side of his craft. But in
doing this Mr. Calvert has written a book which should be read by every theatre-goer,
since it will increase his appreciation of the theatre enormously by opening his mind to
detail of which he was, in all probability, completely unaware, although more or less
conscious of its cumulative effect. After reading Mr. Calvert's book he will find himself
itching to go immediately to the nearest playhouse and regard the drama being enacted
there with what he will feel are new eyes; and since the standard of acting and of drama
generally is dependent largely upon the level of intelligence of its audience, Mr. Calvert's
book will be as beneficial to the theatre when studied by the ordinary public as
when studied by the actor. Finally, this book is an attempt to put the actor again in his
proper position as the pillar of the drama. On this point I am in absolute agreement
with Mr. Calvert. Plays are conceivable in which the actor may be no more than an
instrument in the orchestra. I think they will be written, but I have yet to see them.
But in the plays of Shakespeare and the Elizabethans the actor is first in importance, and
scenery, dressing, music, and everything else must be used simply as a background and
a subsidiary to him. Moreover Mr. Calvert makes a claim&mdash;which is also made by the
late Mr. H. B. Irving in an introduction&mdash;to the consideration of the actor in his highest
moments as a creative artist. This claim, in my opinion, Mr. Calvert makes good, and if
there are any people to-day who still cherish the old superstition that the actor is merely
a sort of clever but shallow showman, then unless they are bigoted beyond the reach of
intelligence this book will dispel it once for all.</p>

<h2>THE FINE ARTS</h2>

<h3 class="left">War-pictures at Burlington House</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">ONE</span> would have hesitated to predict success for a set of commissioned war
pictures: meaning success in the sense of excellence. In commissioning
any painting or piece of sculpture with a dictated subject there is always
the danger that the subject will be uncongenial to the artist, that it may
have no connection with his own intimate experience. This is one of the
disadvantages of portrait painting. The artist is supposed to be capable and desirous
of depicting all kinds of characters, not to speak of flattering them. The novelist and
dramatist are more fortunate. People are anxious to avoid and also tired of their
revelations. But Mr. Horatio Bottomley still expects the Poet Laureate to boom out
the appropriate ode.</p>

<p>Besides the general objection there was the further feeling that the war was a sufficient
preoccupation in itself, and a disagreeable one of such a kind that deliberately to set out
to make contemporaneous art about it would be not only superfluous but almost profane.
It would amount to gloating. The war was a foul and dirty job that had to be gone
through with, and the experience of concentrating on this was enough. It was not without
good reason that immediately following the war the most popular forms of art were
the Revue and the Russian Ballet.</p>

<p>Again, one rather grudges the large sums of State money spent on war-pictures when
one thinks of the comparatively small expenditure on art in peace-time. And those two
rich and influential patrons who started the ball rolling with large contributions, did
they before the war, will they now after the war, patronise art extensively and seriously?
The motive may have been sound, but it was in all probability very mixed.</p>

<p>But doubt and scepticism tend to be quashed by the result, which must be admitted to
be a very considerable success. The field appears to have been so wide that the artists
have been able to select the themes which had most significance for them, and there is
a direct continuity in their present with their past work. Even pure landscapes have not
been ruled out. It is, in fact, far the best modern exhibition that has graced the walls
of the Academy for some time, and the memory of it will still be fresh in the spring.</p>

<p>It is not meant, however, that the Exhibition is full of masterpieces. It contains work
that is representative of much of the best English art of to-day, but the keynote of that
art is talent, accomplishment, and not genius. And this judgment does not exclude such
well-known painters as Sargent, Cameron, Muirhead Bone, Francis Dodd, Clausen,
Orpen, Lavery.</p>

<p>I shall, no doubt, be accused of iconoclasm, of indulging in easy destructive criticism;
and the term Futurist will be hurled at me with such a lot of prejudicial glue on it that,
although it is inapplicable, it will inevitably stick. And I shall be asked if I would consign
the whole of the past to the rubbish-heap and abolish all tradition, and so on. The
answer is, emphatically and vehemently, no! It is precisely because the past looms so
imposing and ever watchful that the late twentieth-century English painters are dwarfed.
Place a Muirhead Bone beside a Meryon (the comparison is not irrelevant, because
there are definite similarities between the two) and the Muirhead Bone will disappear
into the Meryon. Two possible exceptions in the present Exhibition are <i>The Great
Crater</i>, <i>Athies</i> (280) and <i>Deniecourt Chateau</i>, <i>Estrées</i>(284). Place a Sargent beside a
Manet, Courbet or Velazquez and Sargent's horses beside those of Géricault, and the
Sargent loses all vitality. Or, again, neither Steer nor Clausen will stand very prolonged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
comparison with Constable or even Monet. Practically the whole of English late
twentieth-century art is derived from Constable and from the French Barbizon and
Impressionist schools, and is inferior to it. The latter is the significant point. This
may sound too sweeping, and indeed it probably does leave out of account the few
gems which a complete collection would reveal. Still, the fact of it being necessary to
hunt for these few gems and not rather to eliminate the few failures would confirm
the general judgment. We have never had anything like the great constellation of
French nineteenth-century art.</p>

<p>In reaction against the tendency of English Impressionism to degenerate into the
pleasant but slipshod æstheticism of a Lavery there is the crude Vorticism of Wyndham
Lewis and W. P. Roberts. It had once a negative, destructive, rebellious value, but as a
permanent constructive effort it surely is a <i>cul-de-sac</i>, a mere mechanical formula.
Before any theory comes into play the primary test is whether a picture really moves us,
appeals to us. If Vorticist or Futurist art did this, then no amount of argument refuting
their abstract theory could condemn the actual art. But, at any rate, so far as I am
concerned, this art has no appeal to me in a picture-frame. Indeed, it seems to me to be
becoming increasingly stereotyped, and it is amazing that Mr. Wyndham Lewis should
honestly believe in it himself. Mr. Wadsworth's Vorticist design for a house, which was
recently exhibited by the Arts League of Service, absurdly unpractical though it was,
had far larger possibilities in it.</p>

<p>The most interesting work exhibited by the younger painters is that painted in the
more traditional manner&mdash;that is to say it is not abstractionist. It is possible that on
seeing for the first time the pictures of the Nash brothers, Meninsky, Schwabe, Elliott
Seabrooke, one might mistake them for "Futurist" efforts. This is, however, not
owing to any distortion or abstraction, but to the fact that they have in common with
the abstractionists a certain restlessness of design. Even when allied to absolute truth in
representation, this trait might at first sight appear novel and revolutionary. It is, or
tends to be, expressive of a new outlook.</p>

<p>Paul Nash's large picture, <i>The Menin Road</i>, is a distinct achievement. It grips one's
attention. Yet it is overloaded, the incident, the drama of the landscape is piled on too
thickly. John Nash's <i>Over the Top</i>, on the other hand, attracts attention because of its
very bareness and simplicity. On a small section of a snow-covered front men are
stumbling out of a jagged muddy trench into rolling fog cloud. Yet in spite of its success
in convincing us that that is exactly how it was, the picture lacks intensity and depth.
We are grateful to Mr. Nash, as also to Mr. Sargent, for having spared us the harassing
agonies of the typical old-fashioned Academy war-picture. But neither has altogether
succeeded in providing the real substitute. What such a picture would be like still
remains to be seen. For it has not yet been painted.</p>

<p>The distinctive characteristics of the younger school, its sense of actuality, of lively
conflicting movement, its combination of realism with rhythm, are summed up in
Stanley Spencer's <i>Travoys Arriving with Wounded at a Dressing Station at Smoll, in
Macedonia</i>. In spite of certain possible faults of perspective, this is a thoroughly good
picture. But although about a scene in the war, it is not of the war. It contains an inner
civilian joyfulness expressed in unhampered, rhythmical activity. Equal praise must be
bestowed on Henry Lamb's <i>Irish Troops in the Judaean Hills Surprised by a Turkish
Bombardment</i>, which possesses the same sense of concrete (not abstract) dynamic form.</p>

<h3 class="left">The New English Art Club</h3>

<p>There are two large pictures by Stanley Spencer at the New English Art Club Exhibition
which confirm the impression that there is an immense promise in his art and
already considerable attainment. It has such depth and breadth, such spontaneity and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
comprehensiveness. Boggle as we may at certain neo-primitive tendencies in his figures,
at certain humorous irrelevancies in their occupations, overriding and almost justifying
these eccentricities there is the fact that these two pictures do immediately and irresistibly
heighten and intensify our consciousness: they give us a "silent and instantaneous
flash of collusion with beauty." The picture <i>Swan Upping at Cookham</i> is freer from
the static archaistic convention than the pseudo-Biblical composition, <i>The Sacrifice of
Zacharias</i>, which is, nevertheless, because of the landscape background, equally fascinating.
In the former it is the rigid mask of the woman lifting the cushion out of the punt
and the distortion of the shoulders of the dark-faced gentleman that provoke criticism:
in the latter nearly all the figures are a little inexplicable, except (and here the realist will
demur strongly) the gentleman who is footing it gently towards Zacharias and the
Florentine gentleman who is indulging in a graceful and somewhat reminiscent dancing
gesture. These two are an inevitable part of that luxuriant and yet refreshing scenery.
Pre-Raphaelite will doubtless be the derogatory term applied to Mr. Stanley Spencer,
and it is true that he has affinities with that group which started with such promise and
then proceeded to develop its vices more fully than its virtues. But Spencer has not got
these particular vices, an inordinate love of photographic detail and a languishing
sentimentality. His work suggests, rather than actually contains, an infinite wealth of
detail, and it is swept with fresh country air precluding any Pre-Raphaelite hothouse
languor.</p>

<p>Nor must we fall into the error of demanding realistic character studies from an
artist who does not see people from that point of view at all. His outlook is nearer to
that of Blake: his people are embodiments of universal emotions, they are penetrated
with a sense of religious awe and beauty. Or, rather, this is what they would be if his
expression were to reach its full maturity and get rid of its present archaistic obsession.
His figures might still be stiff and intense, but we would not notice this because of
their profound significance.</p>

<h2>MUSIC</h2>

<h3>MR. ARTHUR RUBINSTEIN'S RECITAL</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">DURING</span> the last few months the Wigmore Hall has been the scene of some
very notable recitals given by pianists of the first rank. They had several
interesting points in common. Their audiences consisted largely of professional
musicians, their programmes were generally of a severe and far from
popular type. Yet in spite of the somewhat exclusive character of both programmes
and audiences, so well adapted, one might think, to the intimate atmosphere
of a small hall, intimacy was exactly the quality that in all cases was entirely absent from
the performances. Both with Busoni and Cortôt, and lastly with Mr. Arthur Rubinstein,
it was impossible to avoid feeling that one was at much too close quarters. The difference
between such players as these and the more intimate type of pianist is moral rather
than physical. Some players give the impression that they are playing for themselves
alone, and that it is by mere accident that we happen to overhear them; the others seem
almost to assume that their audience will not listen to them unless its attention is gripped
and consciously dominated by the overmastering compulsion of a powerful personality.
If we are soothed and charmed by the intimate players, we may indeed be uplifted and
transported by the men of might, but there is at the same time the chance that we may
be crushed and exhausted.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Rubinstein is certainly to be counted among the great pianists, but not
yet among the greatest. He is a player of outstanding ability, but not of outstanding
personality. He lacks Cortôt's inspiring animation, and, still more, the monumental
intellectuality of Busoni. A conventional programme, or an almost conventional one,
was the index of an almost conventional mind. The usual Bach-Somebody, the usual
heavy Chopin; no Beethoven (thank goodness!), some modern French and Spanish,
a Liszt Rhapsody to end up with. What saved the programme were the Spanish pieces
and Liszt's <i>Funérailles</i>. If Mr. Rubinstein had had the courage to offer a programme
as individual as those of Busoni he might have given himself a better chance of
asserting his own individuality.</p>

<p>To begin with the two extremes: the Bach transcription at the beginning and the
Liszt Rhapsody at the end are long out of date. Liszt's arrangements of Bach's organ
works may have been very wonderful fifty years ago or more when there were not many
organs in England on which the originals could be played, even if there were the
organists to play them. To-day they are familiar to all of us. Moreover, the modern big
pianists play them too easily. They seek to reproduce, as far as they can, the effect of
the organ, and sometimes achieve a very remarkable uniformity of tone, as faultlessly
regular as any given row of pipes can produce. But this uniformity of the organ's tone-colour
is just the obvious deficiency of that instrument, and the exact reproduction of it
on the pianoforte very easily tends to reproduce no more than the relentless accuracy
of the mechanical piano-player. Mr. Rubinstein played his Bach-Liszt with intelligence
and skill, and even succeeded in suggesting a certain organ-like effect of sonority by
means of an ingenious method of pedalling; but in these days we should prefer either
a more astounding miracle of transcription or, still better, the direct simplicity of Bach
unadorned. Again, if it is still necessary to end a recital with a display of fireworks there
are surely more showy things available now than Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsodies; and if
we want Liszt for his own musical thoughts, we want something that represents him in
a more serious mood. For the <i>Funérailles</i> Mr. Rubinstein deserves sincere gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
Liszt's Hungary is only less difficult to believe in than Chopin's Poland. It is true
that Hungary exists, and true that in Hungarian <i>cafés</i> one may still hear the tunes which
Liszt embellished, but such underlying truth as the Rhapsodies possess is completely
disguised by their tawdry romantic theatricality. As for Poland, "if she had not existed,
it would have been necessary to invent her," for Paris of the eighteen-thirties. That
Poland, populated entirely by devout and amorous aristocrats, is the musician's Mrs.
Harris&mdash;no, his Countess Harricka. Certainly the robust vigour of Mr. Rubinstein's
playing make short work of the languor and swagger of the Scherzo in B flat minor and
the Polonaise in A flat. All pianists are expected to play Chopin; but there are not many
works of Chopin that will stand the strain of interpretation in the modern virtuoso's
manner. The Barcarole is one of the few which by virtue of its serene and classical
beauty has still been able to survive it.</p>

<h3>MODERN SPANISH MUSIC</h3>

<p>One composer stood out with unexpected prominence from Mr. Rubinstein's programme&mdash;Isaac
Albeniz. Albeniz is hardly to be counted among the moderns. His
training as a composer was mainly German, and he came to a certain extent under
English influences as well. Like Chopin, he was primarily a pianist and a composer for
the pianoforte. His songs, a few of which have been heard recently in London, are pianoforte
pieces with a voice thrown in. He lives almost entirely by virtue of the volume of
Spanish pictures entitled <i>Iberia</i>. Mr. Rubinstein has spent a considerable time in Spain,
and it is clear that he has succeeded to a wonderful extent in absorbing the musical
spirit of the country. There was a depth of poetry and passion about his playing of the
<i>Evocation</i> and <i>Triana</i> which he never attained in any other item of his programme.
Spanish music has at last begun to come into its own. We can trace its development
clearly in the successive stages represented by Albeniz, Granados, Turina, and De Falla.
Granados, like Albeniz, writes on a harmonic system that is predominantly German,
in that German influences are the foundation of almost all nineteenth-century music.
Turina, a pupil of Vincent d'Indy at the Schola Cantorum, has affinities with the French
intellectuals. He is the chief Spanish representative of chamber music. De Falla is more
definitely one of the moderns. All four are pianists&mdash;Turina less obviously so than the
other three.</p>

<p>It is easy to see the Spanish element that is common to the whole group. Anyone can
recognise the rhythms and turns of phrase that are derived from Spanish national song
and dance, the more so as all four have drawn their principal inspiration from popular
sources. But it is to us foreigners that the Spanish local colour is most insistently obvious.
In listening to the music of any particular school we may approach it in two ways. At
first we are conscious of the school as a homogeneous group; we notice similarities and
look out for more of them. This may easily lead us into error, for we are tempted thus
to regard as essential characteristics things that in reality are only tricks of manner or
stereotyped conventions of a particular place or period. If we are to form a reasonable
judgment we must be prepared to ignore these and keep our ears open for differences.
We must note not so much the local theme that is common to all the group as the diverse
treatment of it which each separate composer affects. If there is anything really Spanish
about these four composers that is of vital importance, it should be not the mere choice
of a Spanish melody or rhythm as the foundation of their music, but the method on
which the complete structure is designed and built up.</p>

<p>Here begin the difficulties of understanding even Albeniz and Granados. The Spanish
themes appeal directly to the foreign ear, almost too directly; we might even dismiss
them as cheap and obvious. It is the treatment of them that is individual. One's first
impression of <i>Iberia</i> and the <i>Gozescas</i> is that they are rambling and incoherent&mdash;yet it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
would be strange if a Latin composer should lapse into a Celtic indifference to form
and logic. Mr. Rubinstein succeeded in making the Albeniz pieces not only poetical
but lyrical. They tempt a pianist at first to play them at top speed; their style of piano-forte-writing
suggests the rattling brilliance of the virtuoso. Mr. Rubinstein avoided the
error; but it takes a very skilful pianist to do so.</p>

<p>It is not the local colour about Spanish music that we must respect, but its grave
seriousness of intention. Spain has always remained artistically somewhat behind
other countries, just as England has done; and Spain at the present moment, unlike
England, is not anxious to be in a hurry over progress. Hence even De Falla, the most
modern of the group, is possibly a little old-fashioned as compared with the modern
French and Italian composers. Yet he is modern, in the sense that he is intellectual and
anti-sentimental, as compared with Albeniz. This was very evident in his ballet, <i>The
Three-cornered Hat</i>, which the Russians performed all too seldom. But his intellectuality
and anti-sentimentality are distinguished and serene. He makes no experiments
with the purely grotesque, he has no desire to make a complete and irrevocable breach
with the art of the past, as some of the French and Italians appear to do. Even in a
traditional idiom he has something genuinely new to say.</p>

<h3>A SCRIABIN RECITAL</h3>

<p>If anyone could have converted me to Scriabin it should have been Mr. Edward
Mitchell, who gave a whole afternoon of his works on January 17th at the Westminster
Central Hall, ranging from Op. 8 to Op. 72. Mr. Mitchell is a player of extraordinary
persuasiveness. He evidently understands Scriabin, and is determined to make his
audience understand him. He has a very efficient and vigorous technique, and plays
with remarkable accuracy and assurance. No one could listen to his programme without
learning a great deal about the composer to whom it was devoted. Yet in spite of a
very well-chosen selection of pieces, in spite of considerable variety of touch and style,
the concert left only an impression of deadly and morbid monotony. An afternoon of
Scriabin recalled at once to memory the effect of a concert of Hugo Wolf's songs, or of
Elgar's <i>The Apostles</i>. It was morbid and narcotic, a perpetual command to abrogate
reason and abandon one's brain to feeling, to emotion, to a mystical trance. The
emotional force of such music is at times undeniable; what it sets out to achieve, the
representation of moods and emotions, it achieves overwhelmingly. Scriabin has in the
main three moods, a mood of violence and pain, a mood of comatose oppression, and a
mood of struggle, the last of which is well illustrated by <i>Vers la flamme</i>. Perhaps this is
all that some people require of music. Others demand a sense of dignity and nobility,
with a conscious beauty of formal design.</p>

<p>Technically Scriabin can be summed up in a few words. His outlook on music is
purely harmonic. Even in his early works he shows a partiality for certain well-known
discords which he gradually comes to use so often that the resolution of them becomes
superfluous. By this road we lead on to Stravinsky, Casella, and Malipiero. Melodic tone
there is none. This melodic poverty is very apparent and easily demonstrable in the
early works. Here Scriabin is obviously building, or trying to build, on Chopin. But
while comparing Scriabin with Chopin, compare Chopin with Field. Chopin is clearly
an advance on Field in every way&mdash;he has a much stronger melodic line, and a much
deeper sense of harmonic values. But Scriabin is no advance on Chopin, only a retrogression
from him. He can only imitate Chopin's emotional climaxes. He appears to be more
interesting harmonically, because he keeps Chopin's discords and omits his concords,
roughly speaking.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDITORIAL NOTES</h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">AS</span> we write a deputation is to wait upon Mr. Fisher, President of
the Board of Education, in order to press the claims of a
National Theatre. "Why Mr. Fisher?" it may be asked&mdash;a
member of the deputation was, in fact, asked the question. The
Board of Education cannot establish a National Theatre; the Treasury
would scarcely allow Mr. Fisher to make a grant to the National Theatre
fund; and whatever the advantages of a National Theatre and the
elevating influence which might conceivably be exercised by the drama, few
people think of it <i>primarily</i> as educational in the narrow sense of the word.
The answer given to the question was: "Because he's the nearest approach
we've got to a Minister of Fine Arts."</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>We suppose that in this special connection the answer was a true one.
The President of the Board of Education may be supposed to stand in a
closer relation with the drama than other Ministers, though had other arts
been under consideration other Ministers would have been thought of.
Had domestic architecture been the deputation's concern it would have
addressed itself to the Minister of Health, and within a narrow range Sir
Alfred Mond at the Office of Works actually performs some of the functions
of a Minister of Fine Arts. The fabric of the Houses of Parliament is under
his care; his predecessors, Lord Harcourt and Lord Beauchamp, left their
marks upon it. It was the Office of Works which commissioned and supervised
the later frescoes on staircase and corridor at Westminster, and it
is its business to see that alterations are made consonantly with the character
of the structure. But this is a very minor thing compared with the vast field
in which the Government does at present exercise functions in which
æsthetic considerations are largely involved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
Let us, for a moment, ignore the things which might be done&mdash;such as
the subsidisation of a National Theatre&mdash;and think of a few of the things
which have been done, or are habitually done. At this moment a Government
department is supervising, or preparing to supervise, the erection of
hundreds of thousands of houses. These houses will materially affect the
architectural landscape. Design, the suitability of materials to local features
and traditions, these things are of immense importance; what is done
depends upon the competence, the information, the industry, the numerical
sufficiency, and the domestic influence within the Department of the Ministry
of Health's experts. Many departments build, or arrange for building
to their own designs, numerous large public structures, or exercise, or could
exercise, a determining pressure upon the design of buildings erected by
local authorities. You cannot go many miles along the English coast without
finding a barracks, and when you find it you will not like it. We have a complex
of public museums which are the particular care of no Minister. We
have an immense Government printing business which is directly under
the Treasury; it is no powerful person's concern to see that its publications
are well produced. Our Mint produces coins, our Post Office produces
stamps, our War Office produces medals. The most important medal ever
produced by the British Government is the large memorial bronze plaque
which is to be given to the next-of-kin of nearly a million fallen. The last,
word as to the nature of this, and the process by which it should be made,
rested first (we believe) with the Contracts Branch of the War Office, which
has been incorporated in the Ministry of Munitions. We have mentioned
but a few typical illustrations of the confused, haphazard way in which
the State is in operative contact with the Arts; and even then we have not
mentioned the most recent and striking instances, the commissioning of
a large number of war pictures by a "Minister of Information" who
happened to want to see contemporary art well represented in the Imperial
War Museum, and the employment of both British plays and British drawings
as "propaganda abroad"&mdash;the <i>Salome</i> incident may be recalled.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Is there not an overwhelmingly strong case for a Ministry of Fine Arts?
We know there are always those who, when the suggestion is made, drop
the curtain in their minds at once with contemptuous remarks about "official
art." What they ignore is that we are bound to have "official art," that it
could not conceivably be worse than it is, and that proper organisation
would at least give an occasional intelligent Minister a chance. Design at
present is everybody's business and nobody's business. It is not to be expected
that even the most æsthetic of War Ministers should much preoccupy
himself with the "elevations" of barracks, that the best of Ministers for
Education should devote his days to the physical appearance of schools and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
training colleges, that the First Lord of the Admiralty should mind what
his Stores look like, or that even new Government buildings in the middle
of London, though they do engage serious attention sometimes, should be
anything but bad. The Office of Works itself, which actually builds, is
principally concerned with seeing that So-and-so gets so many rooms and
So-and-so has his partition pulled down. There is no specialist authority
in engraving or metal work. Ministers and officials sometimes consult
experts, but it is a matter of chance what sort of experts they will consult.
In no capital, not even in Berlin, are there uglier Public Offices than there
are in Whitehall, or more pretentious ones. As for the immense amount
of War Office building, the Guards Barracks at Chelsea may stand as a type.
We commend them as a medicine for anyone who suspects himself of
exaggerated national vanity. Our museums are starved. Readers will
remember the ridiculous cheeseparing at Bloomsbury early in the war
which, combined with the ruthless occupation and closing of museums
and galleries, reduced many able and devoted public servants almost to
despair. Had these institutions been under the control of a Minister whose
prime concern they were, they would have had a higher status in Whitehall
and he could have fought for them, as it was no one's interest or business
to fight for them.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>We believe that in many regards a Minister of Fine Arts would preserve
us from the worst infamies, and that a good Minister of Fine Arts would have
great opportunities of doing more than that. For certain things he should
be directly and solely responsible to Parliament: the art galleries and those
museums which are not first and foremost technological. It should rest
with his department at least to sanction all designs for public buildings
erected by the central authorities, and it might act in consultative capacity
to other authorities. His staff should include men capable of originating,
obtaining, or vetoing designs for any other department doing work in which
design is important. For the Stationery Office, though it be primarily a
(not very well run) publishing business, we do not see why that should not
be bodily transferred to him. The "format" of most Government publications
is disgraceful, both from the point of view of appearance and from
that of convenience, and were they better produced they might be better
marketed. We are not under the illusion that any Minister of Fine Arts
would initiate great revolutions in Art, but he could certainly greatly increase
our facilities and add to the comfort of our walks abroad. And, where a
subsidy for some definite object such as the National Theatre is wanted, he
would be as the mouthpiece of the State and a Minister amongst Ministers
far more likely to be able to do something than Mr. Fisher or any other
existing Minister. We hope shortly to return to the subject, one of the few
at all impinging on politics with which we feel entitled to deal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
Several correspondents have written drawing our attention to the prices
paid at the sale of Lord Foley's library and to <i>Truth's</i> comments on them.
The facts in brief are these. The Ruxley Lodge library was sold locally;
there were few, if any, bidders for the important books, except a number of
London booksellers, and the sums fetched were deplorably small. All
four Shakespeare Folios (the third imperfect) were there. They fetched
£100, £46, £28, and £20 respectively. Two months ago the Britwell copy
of the first brought in £2300 at Sotheby's. Thirteen first editions of
Shelley fetched £52 the lot, and Keats's <i>Endymion</i> and <i>Lamia</i> volumes
produced £7 between them. Some valuable books were lumped in with
bundles of miscellaneous books and went for a song; it is likely that, with
such cataloguing, many rare and valuable works may have escaped mention
except as "and others": our contemporary goes so far as to say that
"there is every probability that in this way old books worth hundreds, even
thousands, of pounds were disposed of for a few shillings."</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>It is really deplorable that owners, or their executors and legatees, should
suffer thus. Nobody grudges dealers their fair profits, nor does any one deny
that a dealer, like anybody else, is entitled to pick up bargains because he
knows what the other side doesn't know. But for dealers to combine at an
auction in order to prevent a vendor from having more than a tithe of the
known market value of his goods is another matter. We make no direct
allusion to this particular sale. We did not see the catalogue or the goods,
and it is&mdash;at any rate for the purposes of argument&mdash;conceivable that the
best books may have been in very bad condition. Nor do we suggest that
there are not dealers in London who keep outside rings and do not take
part in "knock-outs." But everybody knows that there are rings in all the
important collectors' trades, and that these rings frequently put up at
auctions&mdash;and the country auction gives them their best chance&mdash;the merest
simulacrum of competition bidding and retire to share out the loot among
themselves. In the new volume of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt's Diary there is an
account of the beginnings of the late Sir Hugh Lane's career, given to
Mr. Blunt by Sir Hugh's aunt, Lady Gregory:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>She apprenticed him to Colnaghi at a hundred a year, where he learnt his business
of picture-dealing. He began his fortune, she tells me, by an accident. He happened
to hear of a picture which was for sale in some remote country place, and travelled
down to look at it, but, having no money to buy, although there was almost no
bidding, he was obliged to let it go for a very small price. When the sale was over, the
bidders, who were all professional dealers, went to a public house, and he with them,
and it then turned out that they had been standing in together not to bid, and they
held a private sale of the picture among themselves, dividing the price realised
between them, and as Lane was known to belong to Colnaghi's he was included in
it, and got £160 as his share.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span></p>

<p class="in0">We have heard, we remember, that the picture was a Hals; at all events
this illustrates the sort of thing that happens. Not long before the war there
was a considerable disturbance about the operations of an alleged ring at
Christie's; there were rumours of knock-outs in which picture-dealers
shared out enormous sums. It was widely argued that this sort of operation
should be legally defined as fraudulent and legally punished. That nothing
came of the agitation, in the light of the fact that every honest man (which
includes dealers who have been forced into rings) sympathised with the
agitators, suggests that investigation opened up more difficulties than had
been suspected.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>People are again urging a legal remedy. It appears to us that it would be
impossible to enforce a law preventing rings and knock-out auctions. Nobody
can compel men to bid against each other if they have an agreement&mdash;verbal
and private&mdash;not to, and though large gatherings for a knock-out
might occasionally be detected (but proof of guilt would be difficult),
two or three are entitled innocently to gather together and can easily do so
for purposes not entirely innocent. An occasional bad sale in London is
bound to occur so long as rich private buyers continue their modern practice
of not attending sales. We don't think anybody complained about prices
when the Huth Library or Lord Vernon's rarities were sold, and we have
been to many quite ordinary sales in Chancery Lane or Bond Street at
which scarcely anything went for less than the owners had probably paid
for it a few years ago. There are usually quite enough outsiders present to
keep prices up, and it is only by accident that an agreeable little collection
sometimes goes at a sacrifice. Moreover a private buyer, if he bids, is not
harried as he is in some minor rooms where other commodities are sold;
and some of the biggest dealers, if present, act entirely on their own. Such
as the conditions in London are we cannot see much hope of change,
unless and until (as we said) there is a return to the days when peers of the
realm bid against each other for the jewels of the Roxburgh Library and
their friends stood by them betting on the results. But the most calamitous
occurrences, those which take place away from London, might easily be
avoided if owners or executors would have a little sense. It is hardly conceivable
that Lord Foley took really expert advice about his books; it is
certain that if he knew anything about the market in old books he would
never have had his put up at a local auction. Persons disposing wholesale
of valuables, books, pictures, or china, from country houses should never
allow them to be sold in the country. At Messrs. Sotheby's or Hodgson's,
though a bad patch may now and then be struck, books would never go for
the prices fetched at Ruxley Park; and when a really important collection
comes up the big American buyers are almost invariably present, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
only comment likely to be made on prices is that there seems no end to their
possible inflation.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Last month we stated in this place that we had recovered a few copies of
No. 1 of <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>. These are now exhausted. We shall have
no more copies, and if people send us money for No. 1 we shall only be at
the pains of returning it. We would advise those who are anxious to get
No. 1 to take steps to secure it privately, by advertisement or through
secondhand booksellers. We have still a certain stock of No. 2, and new
subscriptions may still begin as from that issue. We repeat our invitation
to readers who will be wanting binding cases for Vol. I. to let us know.</p>

<h2>LITERARY INTELLIGENCE</h2>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> death, recently reported from Germany, of Dr. Richard Dehmel at the
age of fifty-six removes after a long interval the second of the two poets
who were admiringly regarded by their contemporaries as rivalling the
literary partnership which once existed between Goethe and Schiller. The
Freiherr Detlev von Liliencron, who died in 1909, was one of the initiators
of a new movement in German literature; and of this movement his much younger
friend was often proclaimed the most distinguished ornament. Dehmel was the son of a
forest official in the Mark of Brandenburg, and it has been speculated, without obvious
results, whether there was not some Slavonic admixture in his blood which was
reflected in his work. But there is little in his career which requires further brought
explanation than the conditions of its time and place. He was educated at the University
of Leipzig, where he took his doctor's degree with a thesis on a point in the business of
insurance, and he worked for some years as secretary to an insurance company, a
period of his life which he regarded as having profitably taught him discipline and
orderliness of mind. He developed late as a poet. He himself said that he wrote nothing
worth having till his twenty-sixth year, and many of the pieces in his first volume,
<i>Erlösungen</i>, published when he was twenty-eight, were afterwards discarded or altered.
His works consist of several collections of poems, which he continually shuffled and
regrouped with every new edition (he was inclined to rebuff critics who wished to trace
the development of his powers); <i>Die Verwandlungen der Venus</i>, a series of poetical
visions of all types of love from the highest to the lowest; <i>Zwei Menschen</i>, a novel in
verse, describing the elopement of a librarian with his employer's wife; <i>Der Mitmensch</i>,
a modern play in prose, to which he himself attached great importance; an elaborate
wordless play called <i>Lucifer; Michel-Michael</i>, a political tract in dramatic form; a collection
of short stories; a collection of essays; and a collection of tales and verses for children.
Like most of his generation he was subject to many exotic influences, ranging from
Verlaine to Przybyszewski and from Shakespeare to Pierre Louys; and his works
contain many admirable translations, those from Verlaine being among the best in the
German language. His own poetry is pre-eminently didactic and he preaches consistently,
in allegory, in direct narrative, and in direct precept, the doctrine of self-control
and of the full utilisation of all human faculties. He had passion and vigour, a not always
active power of psychological discernment and an occasional perception of beauty.
He is justly reproached with a certain brutality and vulgarity and, one might add, with
strange lapses of humour. His courage and determination are beyond question; but
in his erotic, as well as in his mystical, rhapsodies (which are often combined) there is
too frequently a disagreeable element of frigid calculation. His obscurity is sometimes
tiresome and unnecessary, and many of his allegories and symbols are incomprehensible
without an external key to their meaning. Some of his lyrics, however, are extremely
beautiful: there are passages of insight and dramatic force in <i>Zwei Menschen</i>; some of
his epigrams and aphorisms are wise and terse; and a strain of earnest sincerity runs
through all his preaching. In August, 1914, though his class was not called up, he
volunteered for service, and, possibly as a reward for a great deal of patriotic poetry, he
received the Iron Cross. He died at Blankenese, near Hamburg, where he had lived
for several years before the war.</p>

<p>Those many who knew the late Edward Thomas, who fell in France in 1917, will
be glad to hear that a memorial is being prepared of an admirable poet and essayist.
It will take the form of a volume, biographical and appreciative, of prose and verse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
and the contributors will include, amongst others, Messrs. W. H. Davies, Walter de la
Mare, V. Locke Ellis, Edward Garnett, James Guthrie, E. S. P. Haynes, and Edward
Rhys. Extracts are given from Thomas's letters to Mr. W. H. Hudson. The book is
being printed by Mr. Guthrie, whose beautiful work as draughtsman and painter in
<i>Root and Branch</i> has not yet had the full recognition it deserves. It will be a quarto,
set in Caslon Old Face type, and bound in dark green cloth, with a device in gold by
Mr. Guthrie, who has also designed a frontispiece, title-page, and initial letters. The
price is to be ten shillings, and prospective subscribers should apply to the Secretary,
Pear Tree Press, Flansham, Bognor.</p>

<p>Lady Burne-Jones, widow of the painter, died early last month. She was the author
of one of the most readable and delightful biographies in the language. Her "Life"
of her husband was written vivaciously rather than brilliantly, and it revealed in Lady
Burne-Jones no notable gift for literary creation. But her two volumes contained no
dull page, few slipshod sentences, and a life-like portrait of one of the most lovable of
men.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The next number of <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span> will contain the first of two long contributions
by Mr. Edmund Gosse embodying his reminiscences of Henry James and
an article by Sir George Henschel on Interpretation in Singing. Either in that or the
next number we hope also to publish a first instalment of the last diary of the late
W. N. P. Barbellion.</p>

<h2>SERVANTS</h2>

<p class="center">By MAX BEERBOHM</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IT</span> is unseemly that a man should let any ancestors of his rise from
their graves to wait on his guests at table. The Chinese are a polite
race, and those of them who have visited England, and gone to dine
in great English houses, will not have made this remark aloud to
their hosts. I believe it is only their own ancestors that they worship; so
that they will not have felt themselves guilty of impiety in not rising from
the table and rushing out into the night. Nevertheless, they must have been
shocked.</p>

<p>The French Revolution, judged according to the hope it was made in,
must be pronounced a failure: it effected no fundamental change in human
nature. But it was by no means wholly ineffectual. For example, ladies and
gentlemen ceased to powder their hair, because of it; and gentlemen adopted
simpler costumes. This was so in England as well as in France. But in
England ladies and gentlemen were not so nimble-witted as to be able to
conceive the possibility of a world without powder. Powder had been sent
down from heaven, and must not vanish from the face of the earth. Said
Sir John to his Lady, "'Tis a matter easy to settle. Your maid Deborah and
the rest of the wenches shall powder their hair henceforth." Whereat his
Lady exclaimed in wrath, "Lud, Sir John! Have you taken leave of your
senses? A parcel of Abigails flaunting about the house in powder&mdash;oh,
preposterous!" Whereat Sir John exclaimed "Zounds!" and hotly demonstrated
that since his wife had given up powder there could be no harm in its
assumption by her maids. Whereat his Lady screamed and had the vapours
and asked how he would like to see his own footmen flaunting about the
house in powder. Whereat he (always a reasonable man, despite his hasty
temper) went out and told his footmen to wear powder henceforth. And
in this they obeyed him. And there arose a Lord of the Treasury, saying,
"Let Powder be taxed." And it was so, and the tax was paid, and powder
was still worn. And there came the great Reform Bill, and the Steam Engine,
and all manner of queer things, but powder did not end, for custom hath
many lives. Nor was there an end to those things which the Nobility and
the Gentry had long since shed from their own persons&mdash;as, laced coats
and velvet breeches and silk hose; forasmuch as without these powder could
not aptly be. And it came to pass that there was a great War. And there was
also a Russian Revolution, greater than the French one. And it may be that
everything will be changed, fundamentally and soon. Or it may be merely
that Sir John will say to his Lady, "My dear, I have decided that the footmen
shall not wear powder, and not wear livery, any more," and that his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
Lady will say "Oh, all right." Then at length will the Eighteenth Century
vanish altogether from the face of the earth.</p>

<p>Some of the shallower historians would have us believe that powder is
deleterious to the race of footmen. They point out how plenteously footmen
abounded before 1790, and how steadily their numbers have declined ever
since. I do not dispute the statistics. One knows from the Table Talk of
Samuel Rogers that Mr. Horne Tooke, dining <i>tête-à-tête</i> with the first Lord
Lansdowne, had counted so many as thirty footmen in attendance on the
meal. That was a high figure&mdash;higher than in Rogers' day, and higher far, I
doubt not, than in ours. What I refuse to believe is that the wearing of
powder has caused among footmen an ever-increasing mortality. Powder
was forced on them by their employers because of the French Revolution,
but their subsequent fewness is traceable rather to certain ideas forced by
that Revolution on their employers. The Nobility had begun to feel that it
had better be just a little less noble than heretofore. When the news of the
fall of the Bastille was brought to him, the first Lord Lansdowne (I conceive)
remained for many hours in his Study, lost in thought, and at length, rising
from his chair, went out into the hall and discharged two footmen. This
action may have shortened his life, but I believe it to be a fact that when he
lay dying, some fifteen years later, he said to his heir, "Discharge two more."
Such enlightenment and adaptability were not to be wondered at in so
eminent a Whig. As time went on, even in the great Tory houses the number
of retainers was gradually cut down. Came the Industrial Age, hailed by all
publicists as the Millennium. Looms were now tended, and blast-furnaces
stoked, by middle-aged men who in their youth had done nothing but hand
salvers, and by young men who might have been doing just that if the
Bastille had been less brittle. Noblemen, becoming less and less sure of
themselves under the impact of successive Reform Bills, wished to be waited
on by less and less numerous gatherings of footmen. And at length, in the
course of the great War, any Nobleman not young enough to be away
fighting was waited on by an old butler and a parlourmaid or two; and the
ceiling did not fall.</p>

<p>Even if the War shall have taught us nothing else, this it will have taught
us almost from its very outset: to mistrust all prophets, whether of good or
evil. Pray stone me if I predict anything at all. It may be that the War, and
that remarkable by-product, the Russian Revolution, and the whole spirit of
the age, have so worked on the minds of Noblemen that they will prefer to
have not one footman in their service. Or it may be that all those men who
might be footmen will prefer to earn their livelihood in other ways of life.
It may even be that no more parlourmaids and housemaids, even for very
illustrious houses, will presently be forthcoming. I do not profess to foresee.
Perhaps things will go on just as before. But remember: things were going
<i>on</i>, even then. Suppose that in the social organism generally, and in the
attitude of servants particularly, the decades after the War shall bring but a
gradual evolution of what was previously afoot. Even on this mild supposition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
must it seem likely that some of us will live to look back on domestic
service, or at least on what we now mean by that term, as a curiosity of past
days.</p>

<p>You have to look rather far behind you for the time when "the servant
question," as it is called, had not yet begun to arise. To find servants collectively
"knowing their place," as the phrase (not is, but) was, you have to
look right back to the dawn of Queen Victoria's reign. I am not sure whether
even then those Georgian notice-boards still stood in the London parks to
announce that "Ladies and Gentlemen are requested, and Servants are
commanded" not to do this and that. But the spirit of those boards did still
brood over the land: servants received commands, not requests, and were
not "obliging" but obedient. As for the tasks set them, I daresay the footmen
in the great houses had an easy time: they were there for ornament;
but the (comparatively few) maids there, and the maid or two in every
home of the rapidly-increasing middle-class, were very much for use, having
to do an immense amount of work for a wage which would nowadays seem
nominal. And they did it gladly, with no notion that they were giving much
for little, or that the likes of <i>them</i> had any natural right to a glimpse of
liberty or to a moment's more leisure than was needed to preserve their
health for the benefit of their employers, or that they were not in duty bound
to be truly thankful for having a roof over their devoted heads. Rare and
reprehensible was the maid who, having found one roof, hankered after
another. Improvident, too; for only by long and exclusive service could she
hope that in her old age she would not be cast out on the parish. She might
marry meanwhile? The chances were very much against that. That was an
idea misbeseeming her station in life. By the rules of all households,
"followers" were fended ruthlessly away. Her state was sheer slavery?
Well, she was not technically a chattel. The Law allowed her to escape at
any time, after giving a month's notice; and she did not work for no wages
at all, remember. This was hard on her owners? Well, in ancient Rome and
elsewhere, her employers would have had to pay a large-ish sum of money
for her, down, to a merchant. Economically, her employers had no genuine
grievance. Her parents had handed her over to them, at a tender age, for
nothing. There she was; and if she was a good girl and gave satisfaction,
and if she had no gipsy strain, to make her restless for the unknown, there
she ended her days, not without honour from the second or third generation
of her owners. As in ancient Rome and elsewhere, the system was, in the
long run, conducive to much good feeling on either side. "Poor Anne
remained very servile in soul all her days; and was altogether occupied, from
the age of fifteen to seventy-two, in doing other people's wills, not her own."
Thus wrote Ruskin, in <i>Praeterita</i>, of one who had been his nurse, and his
father's. Perhaps the passage is somewhat marred by its first word. But
Ruskin had queer views on many subjects. Besides, he was very old when, in
1885, he wrote <i>Praeterita</i>. Long before that date, moreover, others than he
had begun to have queer views. The halcyon days were over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
Even in the 'sixties there were many dark and cumulous clouds. It was
believed, however, that these would pass. <i>Punch</i>, our ever-quick interpreter,
made light of them. Absurd that Jemima Jane should imitate the bonnets of
her mistress and secretly aspire to play the piano! <i>Punch</i> and his artists, as
you will find in his old volumes, were very merry about her, and no doubt
his readers believed that his exquisite ridicule would kill, or his sound good
sense cure, the malady in her soul. Poor misguided girl!&mdash;why was she
flying in the face of Nature? Nature had decreed that some should command,
others obey; that some should sit imperative all day in airy parlours, and
others be executive in basements. I daresay that among the sitters aloft there
were many whose indignation had a softer side to it. Under the Christian
Emperors, Roman ladies were really very sorry for their slaves. It is unlikely
that no English ladies were so in 'sixties. Pity, after all, is in itself a luxury.
It is for the "some" a measure of the gulf between themselves and the
"others." Those others had now begun to show signs of restiveness; but
the gulf was as wide as ever.</p>

<p>Anthony Trollope was not, like <i>Punch</i>, a mere interpreter of what was
upmost in the average English mind: he was a beautifully patient and
subtle demonstrator of all that was therein. Reading him, I soon forget that
I am reading about fictitious characters and careers; quite soon do I feel
that I am collating intimate memoirs and diaries. For sheer conviction of
truth, give me Trollope. You, too, if you know him, must often have uttered
this appeal. Very well. Have you been given <i>Orley Farm</i>? And do you
remember how Lady Mason felt after confessing to Sir Peregrine Orme
that she had forged the will? "As she slowly made her way across the hall,
she felt that all of evil, all of punishment, had now fallen upon her. There
are periods in the lives of some of us&mdash;I trust but few&mdash;when with the silent
inner voice of suffering"&mdash;and here, in justice to Trollope, I must interrupt
him by saying that he seldom writes like this; and I must also, for a reason
which will soon be plain, ask you not to skip a word&mdash;"we call on the
mountains to fall and crush us, and on the earth to gape open and take us
in&mdash;when with an agony of intensity, we wish our mothers had been barren.
In these moments the poorest and most desolate are objects to us of envy,
for their sufferings can be as nothing to our own. Lady Mason, as she crept
silently across the hall, saw a servant girl pass down towards the entrance to
the kitchen, and would have given all, all that she had in the world, to change
places with that girl. But no change was possible to her. Neither would the
mountains crush her, nor the earth take her in. This was her burden, and
she must," etc., etc.</p>

<p>You enjoyed the wondrous bathos? Of course. And yet there wasn't any
bathos at all, really. At least, there wasn't any in 1862, when <i>Orley Farm</i> was
published. Servants really were "most desolate" in those days, and "their
sufferings" were less acute only than those of gentlewomen who had forged
wills. This is an exaggerated view? Well, it was the view held by gentlewomen
at large, in the 'sixties. Trust Trollope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
Why to a modern gentlewoman would it seem so much more dreadful
to be crushed by mountains and swallowed by earthquakes than to be a
servant girl passing down towards the entrance to the kitchen? In other
words, how is it that servants have so much less unpleasant a time than they
were having half-a-century ago? I should like to think this amelioration
came through our sense of justice, but I cannot claim that it did. Somehow,
our sense of justice never turns in its sleep till long after the sense of injustice
in others has been thoroughly aroused, nor is it ever up and doing till those
others have begun to make themselves thoroughly disagreeable; and not
even then will it be up and doing more than is urgently required of it by our
convenience at the moment. For the improvement in their lot, servants must,
I am afraid, be allowed to thank themselves rather than their employers.
I am not going to trace the stages of that improvement. I will not try to
decide in what year servants passed from wistfulness to resentment,
or from resentment to exaction. This is not a sociological treatise, it is just
an essay; and I claim an essayist's privilege of not groping through the
library of the British Museum on the chance of mastering all the details.
I confess that I did go there yesterday, thinking I should find in Mr. and
Mrs. Sidney Webb's <i>History of Trade Unionism</i> the means of appearing to
know much. But I drew blank. It would seem that servants have no trade
union. This is strange. One would not have thought so much could be done
without organisation. The mere Spirit of the Time, sneaking down the
steps of areas, has worked wonders. There has been no servant's campaign,
no strategy, nothing but an infinite series of spontaneous and sporadic little
risings in isolated households. Wonders have been worked, yes. But servants
are not yet satiated with triumph. More and more, on the contrary, do they
glide&mdash;long before the War they had begun gliding&mdash;away into other forms
of employment. Not merely are the changed conditions of domestic service
not changed enough for them: they seem to despise the thing itself. It was
all very well so long as they had not been taught to read and write, but&mdash;There,
no doubt, is the root of the mischief. Had the governing classes not
forced those accomplishments on them in 1872&mdash;But there is no use in
repining. What's done can't be undone. On the other hand, what must be
done can't be left undone. Housework, for example. What concessions by
the governing classes, what bribes, will be big enough hereafter to get that
done?</p>

<p>Perhaps the governing classes will do it for themselves, eventually, and
their ceilings not fall. Or perhaps there will be no more governing classes&mdash;merely
the State and its swarms of neat little overseers, male and female.
I know not whether in this case the sum of human happiness will be greater,
but it will certainly&mdash;it and the sum of human dullness&mdash;be more evenly
distributed. I take it that under any scheme of industrial compulsion for
the young a certain number of conscripts would be told off for domestic
service. To every family in every flat (houses not legal) would be assigned
one female member of the community. She would be twenty years old,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
having just finished her course of general education at a municipal college.
Three years would be her term of industrial (sub-sect. domestic) service.
Her diet, her costume, her hours of work and leisure, would be standardised,
but the lenses of her pince-nez would be in strict accordance to her own eyesight.
If her employers found her faulty in work or conduct, and proved to
the visiting inspector that she was so, she would be penalised by an additional
term of service. If she, on the other hand, made good any complaint
against her employers, she would be transferred to another flat, and they be
penalised by suspension of their licence to employ. There would always be
chances of friction. But these chances would not be so numerous nor so
great as they are under that lack of system which survives to-day.</p>

<p>Servants would be persons knowing that for a certain period certain
tasks were imposed on them, tasks tantamount to those in which all their
coevals were simultaneously engaged. To-day they are persons not knowing,
as who should say, where they are, and wishing all the while they were
elsewhere&mdash;and mostly, as I have said, going elsewhere. Those who remain
grow more and more touchy, knowing themselves a mock to the rest; and
their qualms, even more uncomfortably than their demands and defects,
are always haunting their employers. It seems almost incredible that there
was a time when Mrs. Smith said "Sarah, your master wishes&mdash;&mdash;" or
Mr. Smith said "Sarah, go up and ask your mistress whether&mdash;&mdash;" I am
well aware that the very title of this essay jars. I wish I could find another;
but in writing one must be more explicit than one need be by word of mouth.
I am well aware that the survival of domestic service in its old form depends
more and more on our agreement not to mention it.</p>

<p>Assuredly, a most uncomfortable state of things. Is it, after all, worth
saving?&mdash;a form so depleted of right human substance, an anomaly so
ticklish. Consider, in your friend's house, the cheerful smile of yonder
parlourmaid; hark to the housemaid's light brisk tread in the corridor; note
well the slight droop of the footman's shoulders as he noiselessly draws near.
Such things, as being traditional, may pander to your sense of the great past.
Histrionically, too, they are good. But do you really like them? Do they not
make your blood run a trifle cold? In the thick of the great past, you would
have liked them well enough, no doubt. I myself am old enough to have
known two or three servants of the old school&mdash;later editions of Ruskin's
Anne. With them there was no discomfort, for they had no misgiving.
They had never wished (heaven help them!) for more, and in the process of
the long years had acquired, for inspiration of others, much&mdash;a fine mellowness,
the peculiar sort of dignity, even of wisdom, that comes only of staying
always in the same place, among the same people, doing the same things
perpetually. Theirs was the sap that rises only from deep roots, and where
they were you had always the sense of standing under great wide branches.
One especially would I recall, who&mdash;no, personally I admire the plungingly
intimate kind of essayist very much indeed, but I never was of that kind,
and it's too late to begin to be so now. For a type of old-world servant I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
would recall rather some more public worthy, such as that stout old hostler
whom, whenever you went up to stay in Hampstead, you would see standing
planted outside that stout old hostelry, Jack Straw's Castle. He stands there
no more, and the hostelry can never again be to me all that it was of solid
comfort. Or perhaps, as he was so entirely an outside figure, I might rather
say that Hampstead itself is not what it was. His robust but restful form,
topped with that weather-beaten and chin-bearded face, was the hub of the
summit of Hampstead. He was as indigenous as the pond there&mdash;that
famous pond which in hot weather is so much waded through by cart-horses
and is at all seasons so much barked around by excitable dogs and
cruised on by toy boats. He was as essential as it and the flag-staff and the
gorse and the view over the valley away to Highgate. It was always to
Highgate that his big blue eyes were looking, and on Highgate that he seemed
to be ruminating. Not that I think he wanted to go there. He was Hampstead-born
and Hampstead-bred, and very loyal to that village. In the course of
his life he had "bin down to London a matter o' three or four times," he
would tell me, "an' slep' there once." He knew me to be a native of that
city, and (for he was the most respectful of men) did not make any adverse
criticism of it. But clearly it had not prepossessed him. Men and&mdash;horses
rather than cities were what he knew. And his memory was more retentive
of horses than of men. But he did&mdash;and this was a great thrill for me&mdash;did,
after some pondering at my behest, remember to have seen in Heath Street,
when he was a boy, "a gen'leman with summut long hair, settin' in a small
cart, takin' a pictur'." To me Ford Madox Brown's "Work" is of all modern
pictur's the most delightful in composition and strongest in conception, the
most alive and the most worth-while; and I take great pride in having known
some one who saw it in the making. But my friend himself set little store on
anything that had befallen him in days before he was "took on as stable-lad
at the Castle." <i>His</i> pride was in the Castle, wholly.</p>

<p>Part of his charm, like Hampstead's, was in the surprise one had at finding
anything like it so near to London. Even now, if you go to districts near
which no great towns are, you will find here and there an inn that has a
devoted waiter, a house with a fond butler. As to butlers elsewhere, butlers
in general, there is one thing about them that I do not at all understand. It
seems to be against nature, yet it is a fact, that in the past forty years they
have been growing younger; and slimmer. In my childhood they were old,
without exception; and stout. At the close of the last century they had
gradually relapsed into middle age, losing weight all the time. And in the
years that followed they were passing back behind the prime of life, becoming
willowy juveniles. In 1915, it is true, the work of the past decades was
undone: butlers were suddenly as old and stout as ever they were, and so
they still are. But this, I take it, was only a temporary set-back. Since peace
came, butlers have reappeared as they were in 1915, and maybe will
soon be losing height and weight too, till they shall have become bright-eyed
children, with pattering feet. Or will their childhood be of a less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
gracious kind than that? I fear so. I have seen, from time to time, butlers
who had shed all semblance of grace, butlers whose whole demeanour was
a manifesto of contempt for their calling and of devotion to the Spirit of the
Age. I have seen a butler in a well-established household strolling around
the diners without the slightest droop, and pouring out wine in an off-hand
and quite obviously hostile manner. I have seen him, towards the end of the
meal, yawning. I remember another whom, positively, I heard humming&mdash;a
faint sound indeed, but menacing as the roll of tumbrils.</p>

<p>These were exceptional cases, I grant. For the most part, the butlers
observed by me have had a manner as correctly smooth and colourless as
their very shirt-fronts. Aye, and in two or three of them, modern though
they were in date and aspect, I could have sworn there was "a flame of
old-world fealty all bright." Were these but the finer comedians? There
was one (I will call him Brett) who had an almost dog-like way of watching
his master. Was this but a calculated touch in a merely æsthetic whole?
Brett was tall and slender, and his movements were those of a greyhound
under perfect self-control. Baldness at the temples enhanced the solemnity
of his thin smooth face. It is more than twenty years since first I saw him;
and for a long period I saw him often, both in town and country. Against the
background of either house he was impeccable. Many butlers might be that.
Brett's supremacy was in the sense he gave one that he was, after all, human&mdash;that
he had a heart, in which he had taken the liberty to reserve a corner
for any true friend of his master and mistress. I remember well the first time
he overstepped sheer formality in relation to myself. It was one morning
in the country, when my entertainers and my fellow guests had gone out in
pursuit of some sport at which I was no good. I was in the smoking room,
reading a book. Suddenly&mdash;no, Brett never appeared anywhere suddenly.
Brett appeared, paused at precisely the right speaking distance, and said in
a low voice, "I thought it might interest you to know, sir, that there's a
white-tailed magpie out on the lawn. Very rare, as you know, sir. If you
look out of the window you will see the little fellow hopping about on the
lawn." I thanked him effusively as I darted to the window, and simulated
an intense interest in "the little fellow." I greatly overdid my part. Exit
Brett, having done his to perfection.</p>

<p>What worries me is not that I showed so little self-command and so much
insincerity, but the doubt whether Brett's flawless technique was the vehicle
for an act of true good feeling or was used simply for the pleasure of using it.
Similar doubts abide in all my special memories of him. There was an
evening when he seemed to lose control over himself&mdash;but did he <i>really</i>
lose it? There were only four people at dinner: my host, his wife, their
nephew (a young man famous for drollery) and myself. Towards the end
of dinner the conversation had turned on early marriages. "I," said the
young man presently, "shall not marry till I am seventy. I shall then marry
some charming girl of seventeen." His aunt threw up her hands, exclaiming,
"Oh, Tom, what a perfectly horrible idea! Why, she isn't <i>born</i> yet!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>
"No," said the young man, "but I have my eye on her mother." At this,
Brett, who was holding a light for his master's cigarette, turned away convulsively,
with a sudden dip of the head, and vanished from the room. His
breakdown touched and pleased all four beholders. But&mdash;was it a genuine
lapse? Or merely a feint to thrill us?&mdash;the feint of an equilibrist so secure
that he can pretend to lose his balance?</p>

<p>If I knew why Brett ceased to be butler in that household, I might be in
less doubt as to the true inwardness of him. I knew only that he was gone.
That was fully ten years ago. Since then I have had one glimpse of him.
This was on a summer night in London. I had gone out late to visit some
relatives and assure myself that they were safe and sound; for Zeppelins
had just passed over London for the first time. Not so much horror as a very
deep disgust was the atmosphere in the populous quiet streets and squares.
One square was less quiet than others, because somebody was steadily
whistling for a taxi. Anon I saw the whistler silhouetted in the light cast
out on a wide doorstep from an open door, and I saw that he was Brett. His
attitude, as he bent out into the dark night, was perfect in grace, but eloquent
of a great tensity&mdash;even of agony. Behind him stood a lady in an elaborate
evening cloak. Brett's back must have conveyed to her in every curve his
surprise, his shame, that she should be kept waiting. His chivalry in her
behalf was such as Burke's for Marie Antoinette&mdash;little had he dreamed that
he should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of
gallant men, in a nation of men of honour, and of cavaliers. He had thought
ten thousand taxis must have leaped from their stands, etc. The whistle
that at first sounded merely mechanical and ear-piercing had become heart-rending
and human when I saw from whom it proceeded&mdash;a very heart-cry
that still haunts me. But <i>was</i> it a heart-cry? Was Brett, is Brett, more than
a mere virtuoso?</p>

<p>He is in any case what employers call a treasure, and to any one who
wishes to go forth and hunt for him I will supply a chart showing the way
to that doorstep on which last I saw him. But I myself, were I ever so able
to pay his wages, should never covet him&mdash;no, nor anything like him.
Perhaps we are not afraid of menservants if we looked out at them from the
cradle. None was visible from mine. Only in later years and under external
auspices did I come across any of them. And I am as afraid of them as ever.
Maidservants frighten me less, but they also&mdash;except the two or three
ancients aforesaid&mdash;have always struck some degree of terror to my soul.
The whole notion of domestic service has never not seemed to me unnatural.
I take no credit for enlightenment. Not to have the instinct to command
implies a lack of the instinct to obey. The two aptitudes are but different
facets of one jewel: the sense of order. When I became a schoolboy, I
greatly disliked being a monitor's fag. Other fags there were who took pride
in the quality of the toast they made for the breakfasts and suppers of their
superiors. My own feeling was that I would rather eat it myself, and that if
I mightn't eat it myself I would rather it were not very good. Similarly, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>
I grew to have fags of my own, and by morning and by evening one of them
solemnly entered to me bearing a plate on which those three traditional
pieces of toast were solemnly propped one against another, I cared not at all
whether the toast were good or bad, having no relish for it at best, but could
have eaten with gusto toast made by my own hand, not at all understanding
why that member should be accounted too august for such employment.
Even so in my later life. Loth to obey, loth to command. Convention (for
she too frightens me) has made me accept what servants would do for me by
rote. But I would liefer have it ill-done than ask even the least mettlesome
of them to do it better, and far liefer, if they would only be off and not do it
at all, do it for myself. In Italy&mdash;dear Italy, where I have lived much&mdash;servants
do still regard service somewhat in the old way, as a sort of privilege;
so that with Italian servants I am comparatively at my ease. But oh, the
delight when on the afternoon of some local <i>festa</i> there is no servant at all in
the little house! Oh, the reaction, the impulse to sing and dance, and the
positive quick obedience to that impulse! Convention alone has forced me
to be anywhere a master. Ariel and Caliban, had I been Prospero on that
island, would have had nothing to do and nothing to complain of; and Man
Friday on that other island would have bored me, had I been Crusoe. When
I was a king in Babylon and you were a Christian slave, I promptly freed you.</p>

<p>Anarchistic? Yes; and I have no defence to offer, except the rather lame
one that I am a Tory Anarchist. I should like every one to go about doing
just as he pleased&mdash;short of altering any of the things to which I have grown
accustomed. Domestic service is not one of those things, and I should be
glad were there no more of it.</p>

<p class="center">By EDWARD SHANKS</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">WHEN</span> <i>The Journal of a Disappointed Man</i> was first published
in March, 1919, the suspicious circumstances that it contained
an introduction by Mr. H. G. Wells, and purported to be
written by a young assistant in the Natural History Museum
at South Kensington, immediately produced the impression that it was a
fictitious work, composed by Mr. Wells himself. He was known at that time,
from other books acknowledged to be his, to be feeling a particular interest
in the philosophical problem of human suffering; he had done something
of the kind before, and many readers, it may be conjectured, unconsciously
found it a relief to suppose that this almost unbearably tragic history had
been invented. But the impression could not long survive a careful study
of the book. The author's identity was soon guessed at by a few persons
who knew him and suspected by some who had heard of him; and presently
Mr. Wells wrote to a newspaper to say that the only fictitious details in the
Journal were the author's name and the date of his death, there given as
December 31st, 1917. This date was in fact incorrect by nearly two years.
Bruce Frederick Cummings lived until October 30th, 1919, that is to say
for seven months after the publication of his diary.</p>

<p>Thus it comes about that the later part of it, which has not yet been printed,
contains many references to his critics, in whose opinions he was deeply
and frankly interested. He remarks again and again on the ordinary incompetence
of reviewers, the usual complaint of an author, but especially
poignant here. He mentions, once in a letter and once in the diary, an imbecile
who thought that he was "a social climber"; and he welcomes with joy
the first writer who seemed to him to have read the book carefully. But
among all these references to his work there is none more illuminating than
the last entry he ever made:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Friends and relatives say I have not drawn my true self. But that's because I've
taken my clothes off and they can't recognise me stark! The Book is a self-portrait
in the nude.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Thus, with this final self-explanation, he ends his work. The last two words
stand alone at the top of a left-hand page, and opposite them in the book
lies the blotting-paper he used. He had often before said farewell to his
Journal. Once it was in a fit of disgust with it and himself, and he took it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
up again to record the discovery that he was suffering from an incurable
disease. Once again, owing to the paralysis of his right hand, writing became
too painful for him, and he thought this the hardest and shrewdest stroke of
fate to deprive him of his secret consolation. Last, under the date May 25th,
1919, he made an entry of four pages, chiefly supplementing earlier entries,
and concluded with the words, large and scrawled, but legible: "This is
the end. I am not going to keep a diary any more." Then on June 1st, without
explanation, he made a long entry, recalling an experience of early life,
and on June 3rd the very last, which I have quoted. He desired that at the end
should be written, "The rest is silence," for an inscription on the base of
his "self-erected monument." Genuine self-portraits in the nude occur
very rarely in the history of literature. This is a picture of a man of genius
superbly drawn by himself. It is an astonishing book about an astonishing
man.</p>

<p>Barbellion was born on September 7th, 1889, and was the third son
of a reporter employed by a newspaper in a Devonshire town. He was
able to remember the first time a bird's nest was ever shown to him; but
a passion for natural history became very early the most important part of
his life. He was articled as a boy to his father's unattractive and uncongenial
profession. He nevertheless continued to pursue his passion with an extraordinary
energy and strength of will, and was determined to secure somehow
or other an entrance into the desired career. He was otherwise and exactingly
occupied and he was entirely self-taught; and in 1910, just when by great
good fortune he had been offered, and had accepted, a post in the Plymouth
Marine Laboratory, his father's health broke down altogether, compelling
him to renounce this dazzling but ill-paid opportunity. But in the following
year he won in open competition an appointment in the Natural History
Museum, which justified the abandonment of journalism.</p>

<p>In 1909 there first appears in the diary the definite indication of a theme
which was soon to rival natural history in importance and at last most horribly
to overwhelm it.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Feeling ill&mdash;like a sloppy tadpole. My will is paralysed. I visit the Doctor regularly
to be stethoscoped, ramble about the streets, idly scan magazines in the Library and
occasionally rink&mdash;with palpitation of the heart as a consequence. In view of the
shortness, bitterness and uncertainty of life, all scientific labour for me seems futile.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">After this the subject of his health is rarely absent for many pages together.
The deaths of his father and mother deepened the preoccupation, and
Barbellion's symptoms and dreads were almost infinite in their variety. He
suffered from intermittent action of the heart, from nervous weakness, and
from dyspepsia; he feared now paralysis, now blindness, now consumption.
The thought of death was constantly with him, but until the end he could
not be sure in what form it would come. Sometimes he longed for it to finish
his sufferings, sometimes he hoped it would linger enough to allow him to
complete the work he had in hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
Meanwhile, amid the unescapable and agonising reflections which this
condition induced, another side of his nature was being developed. In 1910
there is an entry which again is like the first tentative introduction of a musical
theme in a symphony:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I hope to goodness she doesn't think I want to marry her. In the Park, in the dark,
kissing her, I was testing and experimenting with a new experience.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">He was not, of course, by any means so callous and inhuman as this brief
note might make him appear; but he was immensely curious about himself
and about other people, and immensely greedy for new sensations. He
dabbled a good deal in love-making, and his dabbling was prompted partly
by the natural pressure of the senses, partly by curiosity. At last he fell in
love, could not make up his mind whether he wanted to marry, made it up
and was rejected, felt relieved, then unhappy, renewed his suit and was
accepted. In September, 1915, he was married. A few weeks before, during
a holiday at Coniston, boisterously prosecuted with his usual reckless disregard
of his weak health, he had fallen and jarred his spine, and this had
brought on a partial paralysis which filled him with the gloomiest thoughts
and seemed to suggest the cancellation of all his plans. But his doctor made
light of the matter and the marriage took place.</p>

<p>In the following November, having formally presented himself for
recruitment, he was led by curiosity to read the sealed certificate written by
his own doctor, not supposing that its being sealed had any particular
significance. Thus he discovered, while sitting in a railway-carriage, that
eighteen months before he had shown the first symptoms of a terrible and
incurable disease and that this had been concealed from him, though it had
been communicated to his relatives. He found later that it had been known
to his wife before their marriage and also that his fall at Coniston had
reawakened activity among the bacteria and hastened the end. In 1916 his
daughter was born, and in July of the following year his rapidly failing
strength compelled him, after ineffectual periods of sick leave, to resign his
appointment at the Museum. His health varied; he grew worse and recovered
a little, but never recovered what he had lost. He prepared his diary for
publication, but the publishers who had accepted it became afraid of it
when it was partly set up in type and asked to be relieved of the undertaking.
Another publisher was found. The book appeared, and its reception did
something to soften the miseries of his last months.</p>

<p>How profound and unremitting were these miseries, and how he bore
them, is shown in the last section of the diary. His disease was painful and
the end certain. He had a wife, who was often fatigued and ill, and a child,
and he had next to no money. The strain of witnessing his sufferings, as
well as the necessity of earning her living, made it imperative that his wife
should spend long periods of time away from him. In 1919 there was an
idea that a certain prolonged and troublesome treatment might possibly,
though only possibly, effect an improvement. But he did not care to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_546" id="Page_546">546</a></span>
experimented with then. He was already dead, he said, it was too late, he
could not bear the burden of a fresh hope. He continued to be tortured by
the long-drawn-out agony of his dissolution, by the defeat of all his ambitions,
and by the black prospects of his wife and child. But the success of
his book brings a curiously sweeter and gentler note into the diary, a note
most poignant to the reader who could understand his refusing to be grateful
for anything.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am still miserable [he writes], especially on E.'s account&mdash;that dear, brave woman.
But I have suffered a <i>change</i>. My whole soul is sweetened by the love of those near
and dear to me, and by the sympathy of those reading my book.</p></blockquote>

<p>Grants were made to him out of various funds, and, just before his death,
a committee of distinguished literary men was formed to see that his wife
and child did not want. This in particular touched him to gratitude, and he
died proud and happy in the thought that those who should have been dependent
on him had so many good friends to serve them instead. A few hours
before the end he said to his brother, "You will soon be able to blow the
trumpets and bang the brasses"; but his eyes were full of a pathetic desire
to have it denied.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to understand the complaint made by his friends and
relatives that he had drawn a misleading portrait of himself, any more than
it is difficult to understand his own protest that he had drawn himself with
the clothes off. Both points of view are exceedingly natural, and perhaps it
is possible for a disinterested observer to see in the diary the whole truth
which could not be immediately obvious either to himself or to those who
were closely connected with him. We need not involve ourselves very deeply
in the theories of psycho-analysis to make the point that a man who keeps
a journal will use it very largely to put down what he can say nowhere else,
and to express that side of him which cannot be expressed in the ordinary
world. Why else indeed should he keep a journal? It is thus that arise
apparent contradictions between the outward appearance and the confession.
On one occasion Barbellion says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I have no personal courage and all this pride boils up behind a timid exterior.
I quail often before stupid but overbearing persons who consequently never realise
my contempt of them.... Of course, to intimate friends (only about three persons
in the wide, wide world), I can always give free vent to my feelings and I do so in
privacy with that violence in which a weak character usually finds some compensation
for his intolerable self-imposed reserve and restraint in public. I can never marvel
enough at the ineradicable turpitude of my existence, at my <i>double-facedness</i>, and the
remarkable contrast between the face I turn to the outside world and the face my
friends know. It's like leading a double existence or artificially constructing a puppet
to dangle before the crowd while I fulminate behind the scenes. If only I had the
moral courage to play my part in life&mdash;to take the stage and be myself, to enjoy the
delightful sensation of making my presence felt, instead of this vapourish mumming&mdash;then
this Journal would be quite unnecessary.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">No man who is a hero to himself stands a very good chance of seeming a
hero to other people. But in this passage Barbellion not only shows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
difference between his appearance and his self-portraiture, but also directs
attention to one of the factors which make his diary so extraordinary a document.
He was aware of the contrast between what he allowed the world
to see and the rest of his nature; but this contrast remained profoundly
mysterious to himself. He understood himself enough to be able to describe
himself, but not so thoroughly that the knowledge could remove all curiosity;
and, in fact, while he knew much of his own character that no one else knew,
there was left something over of which he was ignorant.</p>

<p>He once said:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am apparently a triple personality: (1) The respectable youth. (2) The foul-mouthed
commentator and critic. (3) The real but unknown I. Curious that these
three should live together amiably in the same tenement.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">One might also say that the reader of the diary discovers another triple
personality: (1) Barbellion as he must have seemed to others. (2) Barbellion
as he thought he seemed to others. (3) The real Barbellion, not fully known
even to himself, yet, between his appearance and his confessions, for ever
unconsciously betraying himself. In actual fact, he was, it is agreed by all
who knew him, a man of enormous, almost dæmonic force of character.
I have already alluded to the reckless vigour with which he drove his failing
body through all manner of tasks and difficulties, and this trait in him gives
a fair idea of his spirit. From boyhood onward he was weakened by continual
ill-health. The diary is full of medical observations and forebodings,
but no one, not even his family, realised how constantly the fear of sickness
and death attended him. He never mentioned his health save in a tone of
cheerful cynicism: he never pampered himself or allowed himself to be
pampered. In spite of his palpitating heart, he exposed himself to fatigues
and performed feats of endurance which a sound man might well have
avoided. He worked furiously and unceasingly. He kept his balance and
his courage under staggering blows of ill-fortune. Never was there so impossible
an ambition as that of this sickly youth in a provincial town, already
chained to the dreary work of a reporter, who desired, without any help,
without even any decent opportunities for self-instruction, to obtain a
scientific appointment. Yet he overcame these obstacles and his ambition
was fulfilled. And when this was taken from him, when nothing was left
but a few painful months of life and his Journal, when it was infinite labour
even to trace a few words on the page, he continued the self-portrait which
had become his last ambition as long as he could hold a pen at all. The
straggling, irregularly-formed letters which sprawl across the paper are the
last witnesses of his invincible courage.</p>

<p>And to others this timid and cowardly young man seemed strong, masterful,
difficult to manage, frightening, sometimes savage and bitter in conversation,
but always magnetic and fascinating. "I know," he says, "I am
not prepossessing in appearance&mdash;my nose is crooked and my skin is
blotched." In reality his height, his distinction of bearing and fine hair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
produced an immediate effect of good looks&mdash;which, with the emaciation of
his final days, changed into an austere and painful beauty. He had particularly
beautiful hands, and his photographs certainly represent him as being
not only noticeable but also attractive. The disparity between what he says
of himself and what others thought of him involves no real contradiction.
He is writing of the hidden and secret personality whom no one else knew,
and the fact that no one else could know this personality, save by his own
deliberate act of revelation, is another proof of his strength. He is describing
the other side of the moon.</p>

<p>His ambition was the one part of his secret life which was too great and
too violent for even him to hide altogether. He might doubt his own qualities,
but he could not conceal from himself or from others what he desired to be
and to do. His ambitions were, he thought, very soon and very easily defeated,
but the title he gave to his book, a catchpenny title, as he owned, and something
wanting in sincerity, confessed to a graver defeat than he actually
sustained. His achievements were not great in bulk. His scientific triumph
was the triumph of reaching a self-proposed aim in spite of almost impossible
obstacles; but it was worth less in itself than as a witness to character. He
might have become one of the greatest of English biologists; but promise
is only promise, and this, besides, is promise of a kind with which we are
not concerned here. "In time," he once said, "I should have revolutionised
the study of Systematic Zoology." But he was not allowed time, and his
scientific observations will be amplified, superseded, heaped under at last
by an accumulation of the work of his successors. In literature his position
is very different.</p>

<p>When his book was being prepared for publication and while he was still
ignorant what reception it would have he remarked without hesitation that
he "liked to look at himself posthumously as a writer"; and it appears
from the introduction to <i>Enjoying Life</i> that his friends had long before
expected him to turn his whole attention to literature. Even here his work
is comprised in small space. It consists of three things: the published <i>Journal
of a Disappointed Man</i>, containing extracts from his diaries between 1903
and 1917, the posthumous volume, <i>Enjoying Life and Other Literary Remains</i>,
containing, together with a number of essays and articles, long passages
omitted for the sake of space from the previous book, and the still unpublished
diary from the beginning of 1918 onwards. Even from this certain
deductions must be made. The scientific articles in the second volume were
only just worth reprinting; and the essays on journal-writers and the two
short stories, though they are promising, are yet no more than the experiments
of a man who was considering giving himself formally to the profession
of literature. But when all these deductions are made there is a residue
which is unique in value.</p>

<p>In the introduction to the first volume Mr. Wells very comprehensively
lays stress on the circumstances of Barbellion's fate. He represents the
diarist as saying, "You shall have at least one specimen carefully displayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
and labelled. Here is a recorded unhappiness. When you talk about life and
the rewards of life and the justice of life and its penalties, what you say must
square with this." This is, of course, an aspect of the matter which no reader
could manage to overlook, even if he desired (as he might conceivably
desire) to do so. It would be a pity, however, if we were to consider it to the
exclusion of every other aspect. Barbellion was not essentially a <i>specimen</i>
who by good luck had the ability to display and label himself. If his circumstances
had been quite other than they were, he would still have been a
remarkable man and would almost certainly have done remarkable work. His
disease and death ought to play the same part in our conception of him that
they do in our conception of Keats, with whom, besides, he had certain
affinities which he half-consciously recognised. We do not know what part
disease played in creating or forcing or conditioning Keats's genius; we
only know that it infuses a poignancy and a colour into our picture of his
life. He does not appear to us as the diseased poet, but as a poet who, as it
happened, was stricken with disease. So with Barbellion: he had a personality
and a gift for describing his experiences; and, since it fell out that his
experiences were tragic, therefore the story he tells is a tragedy. But the
tragedy is not interesting only as such. It is interesting because the principal
figure in it is Barbellion.</p>

<p>The comparison with Keats is natural, is suggestive, and can be supported
by a number of particulars, both accidental and essential. "Since the fateful
November 27th," says Barbellion, "my life has become entirely posthumous.
I live now in the grave and am busy furnishing it with posthumous joys."
Keats writes in his last letter, from Rome, "I have an habitual feeling of
my real life having passed, and that I am leading a posthumous existence."
But there is a closer similarity between them than the superficial parallel
suggested by their use of the same word. Barbellion himself made the comparison
more than once, and once in a very significant context.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>You can search all history [he exclaims] for an ambition more powerful than mine
and not find it. No, not Napoleon, nor Wilhelm II., nor Keats.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And this uncontrollable ambition in both of them was one manifestation of
the innermost ruling characteristic which they had in common, the passion
for life in all its shapes and forms, for all the sensations life can bring, which
inspires Barbellion's Journal as surely as it inspires Keats's poetry and letters.</p>

<p>The title of Barbellion's second book was not, as it might seem, intended
in irony. He enjoyed life to a terrifying degree and could abandon himself
to the ecstasy which it produced in him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As you say [he writes in a letter, referring to a review of the Journal] the rest of
the notice distinguishing Marie Bashkirtseff from me by her zest for life is an astonishing
and ludicrous misreading. Why, even since I became bedridden, as you will see
one day, my zest for life took a devil of a lot of killing&mdash;like a sectioned worm with
all the parts still wriggling....</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">In the last part of the diary his assertion is amply proved. Here the zest for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
life, in a man who could no longer indulge it save in memory, is sublimated
to a piercing but sweet lyrical cry, which is one of the most moving utterances
in literature. Before, when he was in possession of all his faculties, when the
shadow of illness could sometimes be forgotten, it is a rapturous and boisterous
expression of infinite energy, high spirits and gusto. Almost any
paragraph in the essay called <i>Enjoying Life</i> would serve to demonstrate this:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Dans littérature," said M. Taine, "j'aime tout." I would shake his hand for
saying that, and add: "In life, Monsieur, as well." All things attract me equally.
I cannot concentrate. I am ready to do anything, go anywhere, think anything, read
anything. Wherever I hitch my waggon I am confident of an adventurous ride.
Somebody says, "Come and hear some Wagner." I am ready to go. Another, "I say,
they are going to ring the bull"&mdash;and who wants to complete his masterpiece or
count his money when they are going to ring the bull? I will go with you to Norway,
Switzerland, Jericho, Timbuctoo. Talk to me about the Rosicrucians or the stomach
of a flea and I will listen to you. Tell me that the Chelsea Power Station is as beautiful
as the Parthenon at Athens and I'll believe you. Everything is beautiful, even the
ugly&mdash;why did Whistler paint the squalor of the London streets, or Brangwyn the
gloom of a steam-crane? To subscribe to any one particular profession, mode of
life, doctrine, philosophy, opinion, or enthusiasm, is to cut oneself off from all the
rest&mdash;I subscribe to all. With the whole world before you, beware lest the machinery
of education seizes hold of the equipotential of your youth and grinds you out the
finished product! You were a human being to start with&mdash;<i>now</i>, you are only a soldier,
sailor, tinker, tailor. Leonardo da Vinci, racked with frustrate passion after the
universal, is reported to have declared that only to do one thing and only to know
one thing was a disgrace, no less.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><i>Crying for the Moon</i>, the essay which follows, also extracted from the Journal,
is the obverse of the same coin:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I am passing through the world swiftly and have only time to live my own life.
I am cut off by my own limitations and environment from knowing much or understanding
much. I know nothing of literature and the drama; I have but little ear for
music. I do not understand art. All these things are closed to me. I am passing swiftly
along the course of my life with many others whom I shall never meet. How many
dear friends and kindred spirits remain undiscovered among that number? There is
no time for anything. Everything and everyone is swept along in the hustling current.
Oh! to sun ourselves awhile in the water meadows before dropping over the falls!
The real tragedies in this world are not the things which happen to us, but the things
which don't happen.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">There are critics who would trace the source of such outbursts as these and
of the joy in life that constantly appears in Keats to the effects of bacterial
disease. We cannot contradict the conclusion, which may have a certain
truth. We can only point out that the same cause does not always produce
the same effect, and we must therefore deduce a particular genius in those
in whom this spirit manifests itself. Barbellion was, from one point of view,
a case of pathology, but he was not, any more than was Keats, nothing but
that. He had a fine temperament which he expressed very finely.</p>

<p>There is a temptation when one is considering the Journal, to which
Barbellion's work must eventually be reduced, to consider it as so much raw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
material and to speculate how, if he had lived, he would have used the many
talents he displays in it. He began it as a record of a naturalist's observations,
and it developed only very gradually into a self-portrait and a repository
for all his reflections and impressions. He was still, when his last illness
overtook him, a professional scientist, scribbling in his diary at night for a
hobby. But he was thinking of going over to literature; and one cannot help
asking whether, if he had done so, he would not have turned his genius to
some more formal and less miscellaneous method of expression. It is easy to
discern in him any number of capacities. He might have become a critic&mdash;a
statement which can be proved by a few examples taken at random:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I thoroughly enjoy Hardy's poetry for its masterfulness, for his sheer muscular
compulsion over the words and sentences. In his rough-hewn lines he yokes the
recalcitrant words together and drives them along mercilessly with something that
looks like simple brute strength.... All this pleases me the more for I know to
my cost what stubborn, sullen, hephæstian beasts words and clauses can sometimes
be. It is nice to see them punished. Hardy's poetry is Michael Angelo rather than
Greek, Browning not Tennyson.</p>

<p>It amuses me to discover the evident relish with which the author of <i>The Daffodil
Fields</i> emphasises the blood and the flowers in the attack on Achi Baba. It's all blood
and beautiful flowers mixed up together to Masefield's great excitement.... Still,
to call Gallipoli "bloody hell" is, after all, only a pedantically exact description.
You understand, tho', a very remarkable book&mdash;a work of genius.</p>

<p>... James Joyce's <i>Portrait of the Artist</i>&mdash;one of those books which the mob will
take fifty years to discover but once discovered will again neglect.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">He might have been a psychological or a satirical novelist, a metaphysician,
a casual essayist. He might have been a poet of nature. His diaries are studded
with the most exquisite descriptions of landscapes and living things, which
grow only more vivid and moving as the end approaches and they become
transcripts from memory instead of recent impressions. The last long entry
in the Journal is one of them, and it is so good and so characteristic that it
insists on being quoted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Rupert Brooke said the brightest thing in the world was a leaf with the sun shining
on it. God pity his ignorance! The brightest thing in the world is a Ctenophor in
a glass jar standing in the sun. This is a bit of a secret, for no one knows about it
save only the naturalist. I had a new sponge the other day and it smelt of the sea till
I had soaked it. But what a vista that smell opened up!&mdash;rock pools, gobies, Blennies,
anemones (crassicon, dahlia&mdash;oh! I forget). And at the end of my little excursion
into memory I came upon the morning when I put some sanded opaque bits of jelly,
lying on the rim of the sea, into a glass collecting jar and to my amazement and
delight they turned into Ctenophors&mdash;alive, swimming, and iridescent! You must
imagine a tiny soap bubble about the size of a filbert with four series of plates or
combs arranged regularly on the soap-bubble, from its North or to its South Pole,
and flashing spasmodically in unison as they beat on the water.</p></blockquote>

<p>But I think that this way of looking on Barbellion's work, excusable as
it might be, would nevertheless be mistaken. Every author writes the book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
that it is given to him to write, and Barbellion's book was the Journal. If, as
seems very likely, he had developed altogether into a writer, he might still
not have abandoned this form which had become by a gradual process
peculiarly his own. Goethe said that all his works were the fragments of a
great confession, and this is true, in a greater or lesser degree, of most
authors. Barbellion would have differed from the rest only in that his works
would have been ostensibly and formally, as well as actually, his confessions.</p>

<p>And this view is supported by the fact that up to the last he was improving
the flexible and accommodating method of literary expression which his diary
had become. The last eighteen months of it seem to me to show an advance
on the third part of the published Journal almost as striking as the advance
of that third part on the first. The form fitted very closely to Barbellion's
many-sided and individual temperament; and, as time went on and he
understood better what he was doing, he made it fit more closely still. It
was a frame into which he could put with perfect ease all that his roving
perceptions picked up in life: an impression of a landscape or an animal, a
conversation overheard in the street, a suddenly flashing truth about himself
or some other person, a general reflection upon humanity. As a journal-writer
he is not, of course, alone; but, being a strongly-marked personality,
he is unique even among journal-writers. His intense interest in his own
consciousness does not, as it did with Amiel, blind him to the actual outside
world; he has more humour, more gusto in concrete detail than Marie
Bashkirtseff, a vein of sheer poetry that we do not find in Pepys. This is not
intended to rank him above the writers with whom he loved to compare
himself, but rather to emphasise his individuality among them.</p>

<p>We find ourselves at last wondering not how he would have employed the
gifts he displays in the Journal, but to what pitch of excellence he might
have brought the Journal itself. The last entries are admirably full of matter
and admirably worded. The passage I have quoted on the Ctenophors is of
almost perfect lyrical beauty&mdash;not a random jotting, but an impression
seized and made permanent with all the proportion and balance of a sonnet
by Hérédia. Over against it there might be quoted passages on the old village
nurse who attended him for months, closely and humorously observed and
set down without the waste of a syllable. Or there are pages of reflections
like this:</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 class="smaller"><i>The Icons.</i></h3>

<p>Every man has his own icon.</p>

<p>Secreted in the closet of each man's breast is an icon, the image of himself, concealed
from view with elaborate care, treated invariably with great respect, by means
of which the Ego, being self-conscious, sees itself in relation to the rest of mankind,
measures itself therewith, and in accordance with which it acts and moves and subsists.
In the self-righteous man's bosom, it is a molten image of a little potentate
who can do no wrong. In the egotist's, an ideal loved and worshipped by almost all
men, addressed with solemnity and reverence, and cast in an immutable brazen form.
Only the truth-seeker preserves his image in clay, covered in damp rags&mdash;a working
hypothesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
A man towards his icon is like the tenderness and secretiveness of a little bird
towards its nest, which does not know you have discovered its heart's treasure. For
everyone knows the lineaments of your image and talks about them to everyone else
save you, and no one dare refer to his own&mdash;it is bad form&mdash;so that in spite of the
gossip and criticism that swirls around each one's personality, a man remains sound-tight
and insulated.</p>

<p>The human comedy begins at the thought of the ludicrous unlikeness, in many
cases, of the treasured image to the real person&mdash;as much verisimilitude about it as,
say, about a bust by Gaudier-Brzeska.</p>

<p>Heavens! what a toy shop it will be at the Last Day! When all our little effigies
are taken from their cupboards, undraped, and ranged along beside us, nude and
shivering. In that Day how few will be able to say that they ever cried</p>

<p>
"God be merciful to me a sinner," or "a fool," or "a humbug."<br />
</p>

<p>The human tragedy begins as soon as one feels how often a man's life is ruined
by simple reason of this disparity between the image and the real&mdash;the image (or the
man's mistaken idea of himself)&mdash;like an <i>ignis fatuus</i> leading him through devious
paths into the morass of failure, or worse&mdash;of sheer, laughing-stock silliness. The
moral is:</p>

<p class="center">
γνῶθι σεαυτόν {gnôthi seauton}<br />
</p>

<p>(My dear chap, quoting Greek at your time of life.)</p></blockquote>

<p>The mellowness and sweetness of these lines are worth noting as
characteristic of a transformation which is obviously taking place through
all the last pages of the diary. This transformation adds something in the
nature of a rounding and a completion to the whole work, which might
otherwise have been merely an interrupted record. It enlarges too our
conception of the author's character and capacities and fills in, most
graciously, our picture of him.</p>

<p>Barbellion was accustomed to accuse himself of being an egotist; but, on his
own definition, he was a truth-seeker. His portrait of himself was not immutable.
It grew clearer as he understood himself better and it changed as he
changed. It was not complete when he died because his own development
was not complete. But he carried it as far as he could and made of it a singular
picture. His Journal is a book of an enduring sort, not merely because it is
an accurate and candid self-portrait, but also because of the inherent attractions
of its subject. Barbellion was a poet, a humorist, an observer, a philosopher,
as well as a truthful, passionate, and extraordinarily courageous man.
In drawing a picture of the last he also made a picture of the world as it
seemed to the first four and thus captured in it poetry, humour, observation,
and philosophy. The subject is still too fresh, and, by the vividness of its
presentment, too painful, for any attempt at a final valuation to be made.
A few months ago Barbellion was still alive, suffering and hoping; and, with
the best will in the world, no critic can avoid being influenced by this fact.
But his book is a fair topic for prophecy; and it is not very rash to predict
that, as it loses the sharpness and painfulness of a record of fact, so its
qualities as a work of literature will come more into prominence and we
shall realise that Barbellion was not only a genius untimely overwhelmed
by an evil fate, but a genius who, before he was overwhelmed, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
opportunity to do some at least of his appointed work. Then, whatever
may be the theoretical views we hold on the connection between disease
and genius, we shall be able to think less of Barbellion as a "case" and
more of him as a writer. We shall, perhaps, not think that we have a complete
portrait of him in his Journal any more than we have a complete
portrait of Keats in the Odes or even in the Letters. The greatest of artists
cannot entirely disclose himself in his work. Barbellion did so no more than
others. But he was an artist, and, between what he wrote of himself and what
was otherwise revealed, it is possible to form a picture of an extraordinary
personality.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> evanescence of laughter is most pathetic. Its bubbles vanish
from the sparkling wine that held it so soon after it has been
uncorked, leaving a sadly flat beverage to the critical palates of
future generations. Wit, being a subtler and less easily disintegrated
essence, does not so quickly pass away, but the buoyant bubbles
of laughter, except in some rare vintages, survive but a moment the uncorking
of their bottle. We may smile at the things that aroused the laughter of our
ancestors, bringing our intellect and our imagination to the tasting, but it
is seldom that we experience spontaneously the "sudden glory" of bursting
sides when we read the words which aroused it. It is almost painful to look
through the files of <i>Punch</i> of some sixty years ago, for it arouses that agonised
shame with which one witnesses the failure of an inferior joke injudiciously
introduced into superior society. One blushes for its pitiful exposure. Nor
is it any consolation to reflect that the laughter of our own day will, for the
most part, seem like the cracking of most unsubstantial thorns under ghostly
pots to those who come after us. Very little of the literature of the past which
truly survives is really provocative of hilarity. The Falstaffian passages of
Shakespeare at once leap up as if to deny this statement; but, in the first
place, Shakespeare brewed one of those rarer vintages whose beaded bubbles
wink ever at the brim, and, in the second place, dramatic literature can always
be revived by the fresh infusion of a living actor's personality. It is the
purely written word of humour which will not give that sudden jerk to our
emotions which it gave on its first outpouring. We say that we can appreciate
Rabelais and the comic tales of the <i>Canterbury Pilgrims</i>; we profess to revel
in <i>Tristram Shandy</i>, and to find the <i>Pickwick Papers</i> delicious, and we are
not wrong; but it is a soberer enjoyment than that which these works of art
gave to their first audiences. We pick them up, certainly, when we wish to
be entertained, but seldom when we wish to laugh. There was a tutor at
Oxford&mdash;there may be one still&mdash;who was invariably annoyed when any of
his pupils attributed a historical phenomenon to "the spirit of the age,"
averring that there was no such thing. But surely he was wrong in coupling
this convenient spirit with the ghosts of Stephen Sly and old John Naps of
Greece, for the peculiar changes undergone by laughter are there to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
its existence. Laughter is compounded of the spirit of the age: it is excited
by peculiar and irrecoverable felicities and conjunctions of temperament and
environment, all of which are ingredients in that very real but intangible
spirit. We can guess at this spirit, but we cannot recapture it, any more
than we can recapture the light effervescence of its laughter.</p>

<p>Further, laughter is not a lofty emotion. The beasts, they say, have it not,
but those who are little better than beasts laugh heartily. We ourselves are
not so proud of our laughter that we wish it to echo through the ages, as we
would have our high thoughts ring and our tears, perhaps, drip. The heady
wine that moves it is often an unworthy vintage, more like the champagne
which Murger's Schaunard christened <i>coco épileptique</i> than the true
Hippocrene. So it has been in the past. The shelves of libraries are full of
these flat draughts from which all the liveliness that alone gave them savour
has departed. Yet in all ages there have been nobler bins of these light
literary wines which, for all that they no longer catch at the throat, have a
more lasting quality and never entirely lose their gratefulness to the tongue
of the taster. They may not have sparkled in their prime more brightly than
their now neglected contemporaries, but they live for certain finer essences
in their composition, wit, style, finish, colour, bouquet, or something even
subtler than these, that indefinable taste which distinguishes all that has
been grown on a rich literary soil, warmed by the sun of beauty and matured
by a vintner who has carefully and lovingly learned his trade. Such, after
exciting the laughter of the present in their youth, may in their ripeness,
and even in their decline, earn the humour of posterity. They may possibly
be numbered among the classics, that is to say, among the productions of
any age which deserve to live as models for the future or as peculiarly happy
expressions of a bygone time. The test of a classic is what men and women of
any age will always call its modernity, which means that it possesses some of
those timeless qualities of greatness or artistic excellence which permeate
the spirit of any age. Skill in construction and delineation, accuracy of
vision, fine rhythm, perfect choice of language, happy adaptation of form to
matter, sense of beauty, all these, like beauty itself, do not die. The work
which holds them, even though thinly commingled, will outlive the evaporation
of its bubbles, and may by their preservative effect become, if not a
great, at least a little classic.</p>

<p>To have done, then, with the bush which no good wine needs, I would
like to taste again, in the company of the reader, what, if I may prophesy
in hope rather than in certainty, may become in English literature a little
classic of the future. The bush would not have been so thick had it not
been, on the face of it, unusual so to greet a work that has moved so many
thousands of us to hearty and inextinguishable laughter. I mean the work
of Miss Edith Somerville and her mourned-for second self in letters who
wrote under the name of Martin Ross. Few humorists who write merely to
catch the passing fancy of the day can have been more successful or more
popular: in the merely temporary quality of effervescence they can compete<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
with any of their contemporaries. The sportsman who hates art and loathes
poetry has the <i>Irish R.M.</i> and its fellows in well-thumbed copies on his
bookshelves; the man who only reads for laughter and never for improvement
praises these authors as highly as the most discriminating, and those
who would faint at the suspicion of becoming in any way involved in classic
literature will joyfully immerse themselves in "Somerville and Ross," like
thirsty bibbers quaffing a curious vintage for its exhilaration rather than its
quality. Appreciation has poured in upon them from all sides, from those
who know and delight in the comic sides of Irish life, when treated observantly
and not fantastically, from those to whom hunting and horseflesh are
almost the be-all and end-all of existence, from those who treat their brains
to a good story as to a stimulative drug, as well as from those who bring more
discrimination to their appraisement. The devotees will often claim that they
alone can scent the subtler flavour from these hilarious pages. The Irishman,
unless he be of the kind that despises all light-heartedness in writing of his
country, will assert that none but he can get the exquisite appreciation of
comparing the work of art with the reality which inspired it: the hunting
fraternity will find it hard to suppose that one who knows not what it is to be</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oft listening how the hounds and horn<br /></span>

<p class="in0">can possibly enjoy the skill shown by these authors in describing the joy of
horses and the thrill of hunting. Nevertheless, the books of Miss Somerville
and Martin Ross are heartily enjoyed by a host of readers who are neither
Irish nor hunting people, for the simple reason that they are prompted to
an explosion of laughter whenever they take up one of these stories. The
bulk of these readers would wish to go no further in their appreciation:
they embrace the givers of present laughter with so full a measure of enjoyment
that it would seem to them unnecessary to probe any further into the
chemistry of such excellence, nor perhaps would they deem it possible that any
higher praise than their freely-expressed enjoyment could be looked for by
any authors. Yet to my mind it is possible. While including in one's general
testimony all that can be said by the most extravagant of these admirers,
the taster who is considering the cellar of English literature which is being
laid down for posterity may discern qualities not so apparent to the quaffer
for immediate exhilaration. It is hard to conceive it, but the bubbles may
vanish: if they do, the question is, what will be left? My point is that the work
of Miss Somerville and Martin Ross has the qualities of a wine that will keep.</p>

<p>It cannot be a great wine, for the vineyard is too restricted. The high
winds of emotion have not swept over its soil, nor has the soft rain of tenderness
moistened it. It will always be bright and rather dry like Vouvray, gay
but with a little bite in it: posterity may even call it "curious." But they
will recognise that it holds the authentic flavours that distinguish infallibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
the finer products of English literary bins. The authors have chosen a
small field, but they direct on it an accuracy of vision which is remarkable,
and, seeing that they were two, a unity of vision which is a miracle.
In the expression of this vision they display an unfailing sureness of touch
and a precision which is perfect in its admirable economy. They handle our
language with a deftness and flexibility which is a rarity in itself, and their
style, though always original, is nourished by a recollection of great models
both in prose and poetry. Theirs is a literary equipment of the first class,
solidly framed, well clothed, attractive in appearance, and ornamented with
taste. They touch nothing that they do not embellish: events by their
unflagging narrative power, which goes as unfalteringly as one of their
choicest hunters, character by their sympathetic insight, scenery by their
love of natural beauty, dialogue by their dramatic sense. It is not all Ireland
that they draw, let that be admitted; they prefer to laugh, letting others
weep. Yet, if the whole heart of Ireland does not beat within their pages,
a part of it is there, pulsing with true Irish blood and throbbing with truly
Irish emotions. Their aspect is no more that of Mr. James Joyce or Mr.
Synge or Mr. Yeats than it is that of Mr. George Moore or Mr. Devlin, but,
if they are justly praised for their merits, that praise cannot be diminished
because they looked on Ireland with laughing eyes through a West Carberry
window. Their books are literature no less certainly than <i>Castle Rackrent</i>
is literature, and for very similar reasons.</p>

<p>Well, let us taste. It is a bright dry wine, I have said. It is not, perhaps,
the quality which the authors would ascribe to what they consider their
best work, <i>The Real Charlotte</i>&mdash;an estimate in which Mr. Stephen Gwynn
agrees with them. This is a fine sombre story of a middle-aged woman's
jealousy, for Charlotte is a kind of Irish Cousine Bette. But, if the subject
is comparable to that of Balzac's novel, the treatment is certainly not so,
and that is my reason for not regarding this as the work by which their
achievement can best be judged. It is the work in which they have aimed
highest, and the measure of their success is not small, but the theme of
Charlotte's jealousy and the havoc in other lives which it caused needed for
its convincing development all the powers of a great tragic artist. It is with
no want of recognition of the authors' artistic aims or want of sympathy
with their regret at abandoning them for others less lofty that this is said:
but the work of an artist can best be judged from that part of it which most
nearly reaches perfection. Miss Somerville and Martin Ross most nearly
reached perfection in their lighter stories of Irish life, and it says much for
their acumen that they saw the line on which their talent could naturally
reach its maturity, courageously turning their backs on higher and more
tragic paths likely to tax them beyond their capabilities. At the same time,
it would be unjust not to point out that even in their best work comedy
does not exclude the more poignant feelings. It would be the greatest mistake
to regard these two writers as nothing more than jesters. Their humour is
the true humour which runs hand-in-hand with pity, and the sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
mingled with their laughter robs it of any taste of bitterness. There is a
chapter in <i>Some Irish Yesterdays</i> which shows how their hearts were <span class="locked">touched.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span>
It treats of marriage and love, death and birth among the peasantry in the
south-west of Ireland with a delicacy of feeling which is beyond praise, and
shows that the writers did not observe with the aloofness of an explorer
among savages, but that for them seeing and describing alike were deeply-felt
emotional experiences. The chapter opens with a memory of a wedding
in the little Roman Catholic chapel of the village, a simple ceremony, after
which the bridegroom hauled his wife up beside him on to a shaggy horse
and started for home at a lumbering gallop. Then, in a brilliant transition by
way of Tom Cashen's reflections on marriage and a glimpse of his married
life, we are introduced at Tom Cashen's funeral to the bride of twenty-five
years ago, "a middle-aged stranger in a frilled cap and blue cloak, with
handsome eyes full of friendliness," with her ill-health, her profusion of
children, and "himself" whose "nose glowed portentously above a rusty
grey beard and beneath a hat-brim of a bibulous tint." Then listen to the
passage which follows:</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_28" id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> In <i>Irish Memories</i> Miss Somerville says that this chapter is the reprint of an article by
Martin Ross&mdash;a fact which throws some light on the respective contributions of the two
collaborators. I should like to mention another passage in which these writers touch the
pathetic with distinction. It is that chapter in <i>Dan Russell the Fox</i> in which, while tending
a poisoned hound, the Irish mother tries vainly to persuade her younger son to propose to
the infatuated young lady. He rejects her suggestion as an outrage on the lady, and sets his
face towards America. As the saved hound licks her hand, "It's no good now, poor puppy,"
she says.</p></div>

<blockquote>

<p>The sunny Shrove Tuesday in early March lived again as she spoke, the glare of
the sunshine upon the bare country brimming with imminent life, the scent of the
furze, already muffling its spikes in bloom, the daffodils hanging their lamps in shady
places. How strangely, how bleakly different was the life history summarised in the
melancholy October evening! Instead of the broad-backed horse, galloping on roads
that were white in the sun and haze of the strong March day, with the large frieze-clad
waist to meet her arms about, and the laughter and shouting of the pursuers
coming to her ear, there would be a long and miry tramping in the darkness, behind
her spouse, with talk of guano and geese and pigs' food, and a perfect foreknowledge of
how he would complete, at the always convenient shebeen, the glorious fabric of
intoxication, of which the foundation had been well and truly laid at the funeral.</p></blockquote>

<p>From the funeral we pass again to the cottage in which "the Triplets"
are holding their reception, the three day-old babes cradled in the stuffy
room, hazy with the smoke of the turf fire, the crowd in the doorway, the old
woman rocking the cradle:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Obscure corners harboured obscure masses, that might be family raiment, or beds,
or old women; somewhere among them the jubilant cry of a hen proclaimed the
feat of laying an egg, in muffled tones that suggested a lurking-place under a bed.
Between the cradle and the fire sat an old man in a prehistoric tall hat, motionless in
the stupor of his great age; at his feet a boy wrangled with a woolly puppy that rolled
its eyes till the blue whites showed, in a delicious glance of humour, as it tugged at
the red flannel shirt of its playmate.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Such a passage in a Russian novelist would warrant ecstasies on the part
of our <i>illuminati</i>: let us no less highly praise our own art when it is possible.
The chapter concludes with some lights on the commercial methods of
matrimony practised by the peasant class: the writers do not defend them,
but call attention to the surprising bloom that is apt to spring from them.
"From them springs, like a flower from a dust heap, the unsullied,
uneventful home-life of Western Ireland." "There is here no material,
of the accepted sort, for a playwright; no unsatisfied yearnings and shattered
ideals, nothing but remarkable common sense, and a profound awe for
the sacrament of Marriage. Marriage, humorous, commercial, and quite
unlovely, is the first act; the second is mere preoccupation with an accomplished
destiny; the last is usually twilight and much faithfulness." The
dialogue is a masterpiece throughout, epigram, heart-piercing pathos, with
humour, heavenly and inveterate, lubricating all. Of an elderly couple,
married by a happy thought some thirty years before, it was said, as the
authors' record, "their hearts were within in each other." This chapter,
through which breathes all the soft beauty and humour of the soil, is a
sufficient answer to those who would tax these writers with a uniform attitude
of rather heartless derision or with following&mdash;what a blind criticism!&mdash;in
the benighted footsteps of those who have given us the dreary horror of the
traditional stage Irishman.</p>

<p>Then, again, there is another spirit that breathes delicately through these
stories, tempering their outlines as the mists of the Atlantic those of the
craggy western hillside. It is the spirit of natural beauty, which, to the hearts
of Miss Somerville, herself an accomplished draughtsman, and Martin
Ross, makes ever the sharpest appeal. They make the reader plainly feel that
if the unconventional dignity and penetrating wit of the Irish folk clutches
powerfully at their feelings, the inexhaustible beauty of its surroundings
pierces to their very marrow. Quotation after quotation might be given to
show their remarkable gift of rendering the scenery which has so moved
their imaginations. I can only choose a few, embarrassed at the richness of
the field of choice. The last chapter of <i>Some Irish Yesterdays</i> opens with
an example which it is hard to surpass:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The road to Connemara lies white across the memory&mdash;white and very quiet. In
that far west of Galway, the silence dwells pure upon the spacious country, away to
where the Twelve Pins make a gallant line against the northern sky. It comes in the
heathery wind, it borrows peace from the white cottage gables on the hillside, it is
accented by the creeping approach of a turf cart, rocking behind its thin grey pony.
Little else stirs save the ducks that sail on a wayside pool to the push of their yellow
propellers; away from the road, on a narrow oasis of arable soil, a couple of women
are digging potatoes; their persistent voices are borne on the breeze that blows warm
over the blossoming boglands and pink heather.</p>

<p>Scarcely to be analysed is that fragrance of Irish air; the pureness of bleak mountains
is in it, the twang of turf smoke is in it, and there is something more, inseparable
from Ireland's green and grey landscapes, wrought in with her bowed and patient
cottages, her ragged wails, and eager rivers, and intelligible only to the spirit.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
Here is another landscape, the <i>Irish R. M.'s</i> view of his own demesne:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Certainly the view from the roof was worth coming up to look at. It was rough
heathery country on one side, with a string of little blue lakes running like a turquoise
necklet round the base of a firry hill, and patches of pale green pasture were set
amidst the rocks and heather. A silvery flash behind the undulations of the hills told
where the Atlantic lay in immense plains of sunlight.</p></blockquote>

<p>What, again, could be a more delightful overture to the lifelike description
of the regatta on Lough Lonen than the short paragraph which conveys in
a few touches all the beauty of the scene?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A mountain towered steeply up from the lake's edge, dark with the sad green of
beech-trees in September; fir woods followed the curve of the shore, and leaned far
over the answering darkness of the water; and above the trees rose the toppling
steepnesses of the hill, painted with the purple glow of heather. The lake was about a
mile long, and, tumbling from its farther end, a fierce and narrow river fled away
west to the sea, some four or five miles off.</p></blockquote>

<p>In these descriptions there is no striving for elaborate effect: the authors
simply place the scene before our eyes with that aptness of language which is
like the unerring needle of a master etcher. To travel on the wings of Miss
Somerville and Martin Ross gives one constant thrills of amazement at their
hawk-like swoops after a telling phrase: they catch an apt simile on the wing
with an arresting suddenness which adds moments of breathlessness to the
already exhilarating flight of their rapid narrative. Instances can be picked
out from any of the stories like plums from a pudding.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the depths of the wood Dr. Hickey might be heard uttering those singular little
yelps of encouragement that to the irreverent suggest a milkman in his dotage....</p>

<p>It was a gleaming morning in mid-May, when everything was young and tense,
and thin and fit to run for its life, like a Derby horse....</p>

<p>I followed Dr. Hickey by way of the window, and so did Miss M'Evoy; we pooled
our forces, and drew her mamma after us through the opening of two foot by three
steadily, as the great god Pan drew pith from the reed....</p>

<p>Old McRory had a shadowy and imperceptible quality that is not unusual in small
fathers of large families; it always struck me that he understood very thoroughly the
privileges of the neglected, and pursued an unnoticed, peaceful and observant path
of his own in the background. I watched him creep away in his furtive, stupefied
manner, like a partly-chloroformed ferret....</p>

<p>Miss McRory's reins were clutched in a looped confusion, that summoned from
some corner of my brain a memory of the Sultan's cipher on the Order of the Medjidie.</p>

<p>Like smuts streaming out of a chimney the followers of the hunt belched from the
lane and spread themselves over the pale green slopes....</p></blockquote>

<p>Though the temptation is almost irresistible, I refrain here from displaying
this incisive power applied to character, notably to Irish character.
The success of our authors in this respect is so notorious that further
testimony is superfluous. If we have any appreciation of their art at all, the
Major and the gentle Philippa, his wife, Flurry and Sally Knox, old Mrs.
Knox looking as if she had robbed a scarecrow, with her white woolly dog<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
with sore eyes and a bark like a tin trumpet, against the inimitable background
of her ramshackle mansion of Aussolas, scene of many wit-combats
between her and Flurry, Miss Bobbie Bennett, the McRory family, John
Kane, Mrs. Knox's henchman, and Michael the huntsman, all are as vivid
to us as our dearest friends. It is worth pointing out, however, that an almost
diabolical power of delineation is not the only compelling quality in these
portraits. There is in their introduction of their characters that natural
dramatic instinct which they have so humorously observed in their Irish
neighbours. I need only instance the ingenuity by which Mrs. Knox is first
heard "off," easily vanquishing in speech that doughty antagonist, an Irish
countrywoman: or the introduction of John Kane in "the Aussolas Martin
Cat," in two inimitable pages, which are followed by another perfect passage
of comic drama, the entry into the old demesne of Aussolas of vulgar Mr.
Tebbutts, the would-be tenant:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Away near the house the peacock uttered his defiant screech, a note of exclamation
that seemed entirely appropriate to Aussolas; the turkey-cock in the yard accepted
the challenge with effusion, and from further away the voice of Mrs. Knox's Kerry
bull, equally instant in taking offence, ascended the gamut of wrath from growl to
yell. Blended with these voices was another&mdash;a man's voice, in loud harangue,
advancing down the long beech walk to the kitchen garden. As it approached the
wood-pigeons bolted in panic, with distracted clappings of wings, from the tall firs
by the garden wall in which they were wont to sit arranging plans of campaign with
regard to the fruit. We sat in silence. The latch of the garden gate clicked, and the
voice said in stentorian tones:</p>

<p>"My father 'e kept a splendid table."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Every gathering of their countrymen&mdash;the meet, the run, the horse show, the
races, the regatta, the auction&mdash;have an intensity of motion and character
which is achieved not by the tiresome enumerative methods of some modern
realists, but by the skilful selection of the practised artist, and by a clever
condensation of observations&mdash;their only form of exaggeration&mdash;gathered
over a wide range of times and places.</p>

<p>Finally&mdash;the word starts up all too soon&mdash;let us praise the powerful sweep
of their narrative, for it is this rapidity and staying power which sets the
crown on their achievement. When they are out with the hunt, whatever
be the quarry, they are as "crabbed leppers" as ever moved the picturesque
admiration of an Irish hunt following. They are off at the first cry of the
hounds and nothing stops them, they drop over the slaty fences, change feet
on the banks, thread the rocky paths of steep ascents and career down the
craggy hills, like Flurry Knox's mounts to the discomfiture of staider Saxon
hunters. With them, moreover, there is never a check; they gallop hot on
the scent from first to last, and run the story to a triumphant death in an
ecstasy of unquenchable laughter. Their climaxes are marvellous, led up to
as they are by a brilliant and sustained crescendo. Think of the <i>mêlée</i> at the
end of "High Tea at McKeown's," or of the "Dane's Breechin'," with its
exquisite interlude of the search for the "pin" in the village post-office; think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
of the finale to "Philippa's Foxhunt," with the Irish clergy and Mrs. Knox
pulling the small boy out of the drain; or of Lady Knox's ominous arrival at
the end of "Oh, Love! Oh, Fire!" and the escape of Sally in Mrs. Knox's
pony-chaise, or of the combined catastrophe that fell upon the Major's
household in "A Royal Command." For pure art in narrative construction
these finales are unexampled in English literature of to-day, all the more
because they are free from all buffoonery. Here is one that starts a movement
<i>con brio</i>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A shout from the top of the hill interrupted the amenities of the check. Flurry was
out of the wood blowing shattering blasts upon his horn, and the hounds rushed to
him, knowing the "gone away" note that was never blown in vain. The brown mare
came out through the trees and the undergrowth like a woodcock down the wind,
and jumped across a stream on to a more than questionable bank; the hounds splashed
and struggled after him, and as they landed the first ecstatic whimpers broke forth.
In a moment it was full cry, discordant, beautiful, and soul-stirring, as the pack
spread and sped, and settled into line.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is only one of many such. Let me send the reader to his shelf to take
down <i>In Mr. Knox's Country</i>, and read "Put Down Two and Carry One,"
with its account of the events which led to Miss McRory's riding pillion
behind the Major into the scandalised sight of Lady Knox, or to expire once
more over the mingling of Mrs. McRory's golden butterfly with Philippa's
hat-trimming at the harvest festival ("The Bosom of the McRorys"). I am
compelled to quote, for its rendering of the purely ludicrous, from the incident
of Playboy's nocturnal rescue in "The Conspiracy of Silence" (<i>Further
Experiences of an I.R.M.</i>). Major Yeates, as deputy master in Flurry Knox's
absence, has taken the hounds over to hunt with Mr. Flynn, who, after a run
full of incident, has connived at the secretion of Playboy, a fine hound of the
old Irish breed, in a bedroom at the top of the house. The Major is warned
of this by the youngest boy, whose gratitude he has earned by giving him a
mount that day. The pair thereupon grope their way upstairs to raid the
bedroom in its owner's absence:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A dim skylight told that the roof was very near my head; I extended a groping
hand for the wall, and without any warning found my fingers closing improbably,
awfully, upon a warm human face.</p>

<p>[It was the servant, Maggie Kane, bringing up a drumstick of a goose to pacify the
hound. They open the door of the room, and Playboy is revealed tied to the leg of a
low wooden bedstead.] He was standing up, his eyes gleamed green as emeralds, he
looked as big as a calf. He obviously regarded himself as the guardian of Eugene's
bower, and I failed to see any recognition of me in his aspect, in point of fact he
appeared to be on the verge of an outburst of suspicion that would waken the house
once and for all. We held a council of war in whispers that perceptibly increased his
distrust; I think it was Maggie Kane who suggested that Master Eddy should proffer
him the bone while I unfastened the rope. The strategy succeeded, almost too well,
in fact. Following the alluring drumstick, Playboy burst into the passage, towing me
after him on the rope. Still preceded by the light-footed Master Eddy, he took me
down the attic stairs at a speed which was the next thing to a headlong fall, while
Maggie Kane held the candle at the top. As we stormed past old Flynn's door I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
aware that the snoring had ceased, but "the pace was too good to inquire." We
scrimmaged down the second flight into the darkness of the hall, fetching up somewhere
near the clock, which, as if to give the alarm, uttered three loud and poignant
cuckoos. I think Playboy must have sprung at it, in the belief that it was the voice
of the drumstick; I only know that my arm was nearly wrenched from its socket, and
that the clock fell with a crash from the table to the floor, where, by some malevolence
of its machinery, it continued to cuckoo with a jocund and implacable persistence.
Something that was not Playboy bumped against me. The cuckoo's note became
mysteriously muffled, and a door, revealing a fire-lit kitchen, was shoved open. We
struggled through it, bound into a sheaf by Playboy's rope, and in our midst the
cuckoo clock, stifled but indomitable, continued its protest from under Maggie
Kane's shawl.</p></blockquote>

<p>And now, if I may close with a recollection of what is, perhaps, the most
brilliant of all these brilliant narratives, I will call to the reader's mind the
story of "The Pug-nosed Fox," from the same volume. Every gift of language,
delineation, vigorous intensity, dramatic gradation, and swiftness of progress
over a series of crises to a perfect culmination has been lavished by the
authors on this story. From the misguided efforts of the photographer to
take a picture of the hounds on a sweltering August day, all through the
untimely chase of the old fox to the discovery of Tomsy Flood sewn up in a
feather mattress in the loft of the McRorys' stable, and the raid of the hounds
upon the wedding breakfast at the moment of the entry of the guests, there is
not a moment in which to draw breath. It is life itself, with all the added
quickness to its revolutions and intensity to its vision that art can give.
With this memory I must leave this little classic to its future, but so that art,
rather than criticism, shall have the last word, a typical passage, showing
the authors' ease of transition from beauty to comedy, shall close this grateful
appreciation:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>At the top of the hill we took another pull. This afforded us a fine view of the
Atlantic, also of the surrounding country and all that was therein, with, however,
the single exception of the hounds. There was nothing to be heard save the summery
rattle of the reaping-machine, the strong and steady rasp of a corn-crake, and the
growl of a big steamer from a band of fog that was advancing, ghost-like, along the
blue floor of the sea. Two fields away a man in a straw hat was slowly combing down
the flanks of a haycock with a wooden rake, while a black-and-white cur slept in the
young after-grass beside him. We broke into their sylvan tranquillity with a heated
demand whether the hounds had passed that way. Shrill glamour from the dog was
at first the only reply; its owner took off his hat, wiped his forehead with his sleeve,
and stared at us.</p>

<p>"I'm as deaf as a beetle this three weeks," he said, continuing to look us up and
down in a way that made me realise, if possible, more than before, the absurdity of
looking like a Christmas card in the heat of a summer's day.</p>

<p>"Did ye see the HOUNDS?" shouted Michael, shoving the chestnut up beside
him.</p>

<p>"It's the neurology I got," continued the haymaker, "an' the pain does be
whistlin' out through me ear till I could mostly run into the say from it."</p>

<p>"It's a pity ye wouldn't," said Michael, whirling Moses round.</p></blockquote>

<h2>FORGOTTEN SATIRISTS</h2>

<p class="center">By ALDOUS HUXLEY</p>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">ALL</span> readers of the literary Press must often have noticed that the
most ardently contested and the most prolonged controversies,
among all those that fill correspondence columns with the rumour
of inkpot wars, turn almost invariably upon subjects remote from
actuality and of a nature profoundly trivial. Questions of philology and spelling,
questions of dates and names and little odd facts&mdash;it is on such circumscribed
arenas that month-long combats clash and sway and would go on
clashing and swaying for ever if it were not for the editor's tyrannically-imposed
peace. To the practical man, intent on the immediate, as well as
to the philosopher in his abstract world of ideas, this preoccupation with
facts that are irrelevant both to the money-maker and the seeker after truth
seems at first sight quite incomprehensible. But the explanation is simple.
We have leisure and we hate being bored. We must find something that will
keep our mind busy without exhausting it. We might, to be sure, occupy
ourselves by studying the Einstein theory; but the effort, the agony of
trying to think abstractly! No, decidedly the Einstein theory is too much
of a good thing. So we fall back on stamp collecting or on what is more
absorbing even than stamp collecting&mdash;on the inexhaustible past. We turn
to history, not for any ambitious Wellsian ideas about humanity, but for the
anecdotes, the innumerable bits of Notes and Queryish information which
a little patience and curiosity can pick up like shells on a dry beach. How
pleasant it is and how restful, after an effort of abstract reasoning (if one
has been unwise enough to make that effort), to turn to Disraeli's <i>Curiosities
of Literature</i> or to the <i>Literary Recreations</i> of Sir Edward Cook! We are
amused, absorbed, instructed, and all without the least expense of spirit.
What song the sirens sang, what were Mr. Gladstone's favourite Latin
quotations&mdash;these things we learn and a thousand more, pleasantly, effortlessly,
without tears.</p>

<p>This, then, is my excuse and justification for directing attention to an
incident so remote as the Popish Plot, to men so obscure as Settle and
Pordage and Flecknoe&mdash;their very names are absurd, Dickensian. These
long-dead days of controversy fairly bristle with curiosities of literature.
We catch glimpses of odd fantastic men performing odd fantastic actions.
We see, thrown up by the storm of political passion, strange traits of human
psychology that float on the surface like grotesque fishes of the depths dislodged
by a submarine earthquake. And so, as we cannot all be Newtons or
Empedocleses, let us content ourselves with small things, finding the occupation
and amusement we desire in the anecdotes and old wives' tales of
history, so pleasant, so futile, so absorbingly human.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_566" id="Page_566">566</a></span>
Our purpose is to do justice&mdash;a little more than justice, it may be&mdash;to a
few of the minor characters in the drama of the Popish Plot. But with the
best will in the world it is impossible not to mention the hero of the piece;
Dryden is the Prince of Denmark of the Plot, and without at least a casual
reference to his part the play has no sense at all.</p>

<p>Our curtain, then, goes up on the Autumn of 1681; for, in the approved
style, we plunge <i>in medias res</i>. The Earl of Shaftesbury is in the Tower on
a charge of High Treason. A Bill of Indictment is to be presented against
him. It was in anticipation of this event and with the deliberate intention
of turning public opinion against Shaftesbury that, on November 17th,
Dryden published <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>.</p>

<p>This was not by any means the first time that Shaftesbury had been
attacked. For the past two years the Tory pamphleteers had made him the
target of their most envenomed shafts. One at least of these anonymous
satires, <i>A Modest Vindication of the Earl of Shaftesbury in a Letter to a Friend
concerning his being elected King of Poland</i>, is worthy to be rescued from
oblivion. Like almost every pamphleteer of the time, the author of this
Modest Vindication seizes on the story that Shaftesbury had offered himself
as a candidate for the throne vacated by the death of John Sobieski. The
pamphlet opens with an admirable ironic eulogy of the Earl for "his unshaken
obedience to every government he has been concerned in or lived
under; his steady adherence to every religion that had but hopes to be
established." We are now shown the Polish Diet debating on the choice of
a king, who shall be capable not only of ruling Poland, but also of conquering
and converting the Turk. "Upon these considerations you may imagine
the eyes of the whole Diet were turned upon little England, and there upon
whom so soon as the little lord of Shaftesbury?" The new king, Anthony I.,
draws up a list of the attendants whom he proposes to take with him. There
is, of course, "Prince Prettyman Perkinoski (Monmouth), to cure the plica
or King's evil of this country, in case our own majesty should fail of that
virtue"; and finally, at the end of the list, "Jean Drydenurtzitz ... our
Poet Laureate, for writing panegyrics upon Oliver Cromwell and libels
against his present master, King Charles II."; and to be his deputy no less
than Tom Shadworiski" (Shadwell). This tract, it must be remembered,
was written after the production of <i>The Spanish Friar</i> and before the publication
of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>. The author of the "Protestant Play" might
still be thought to be a Whig.</p>

<p>The pamphlet ends up with the account of a vision wherein the king-elect
sees first the figure of the Whore of Babylon, which changes into that
of a murdered Justice of the Peace (Sir Edmund Bury Godfrey), "strangled
by a crew of ruffians, who afterwards ran him through with his own sword,
that it might be thought he hanged himself." This gives place to a troop
of pilgrims armed with black bills (these pilgrims were one of the happiest
products of Oates's rich imagination); and they in turn are followed by the
hideous vision of the Doctor of Salamanca, Oates himself. All this so deeply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
impresses King Anthony that he gives up his imperial ambitions, preferring
the task of confounding the Pope at home to that of converting the Turks
in Poland.</p>

<p>To this same Polish legend and to a certain physical peculiarity, which
was the delight of the Tory satirists, Shaftesbury owed one of his most
popular nicknames, "Tapski." The "ski" was Polish, but the "Tap"
was English and had a real existence. Shaftesbury suffered from an internal
abscess, which had to be kept drained by a silver tube let into his side.
For the Tories this tap represented all that was most loathsome, most repulsive,
most Whiggish. They exulted in descriptions of it. When Shaftesbury
wanted to make himself look important, so one pamphleteer assures us, he
had only to turn off the tap in order to swell up to a prodigious size. Shaftesbury's
Tap and that mysterious Black Box, reputed to contain the certificate
of a marriage between Charles II. and Lucy Waters, were the two symbolic
objects on which public imagination most greedily seized.</p>

<p>Dryden's satire was issued anonymously. But its authorship was evidently
an open secret, for within three weeks of its publication a reply, called <i>Towser
the Second</i>, in which Dryden is named as the author, made its appearance.
The writer of this piece was the Whig journalist, Henry Care, "whose
breeding," says Anthony Wood, "was in the nature of a petty Fogger, a
little despicable Wretch, afterwards much reflected upon for a poor snivelling
Fellow in the Observators published by Rog: L'Estrange." This person had
been the writer of a newspaper entitled <i>The Weekly Paquets of News from
Rome</i>, an anti-Catholic journal started in the height of the excitement caused
by Titus Oates's evidence. He had been tried in 1680 for libelling Justice
Scroggs. His later history is the sadly common tale of the poor Grub Street
hack: at the accession of James II. "for bread and Money sake, and nothing
else," he passed over to the side in power and turned his pen against
the Protestants. <i>Towser the Second</i> is as little and despicable as its author.
Towser-Dryden, brother to the original bad dog, Towser-L'Estrange,
suffering from a worm "that of the Jebusites smells very strong," runs mad,
snarls and snaps at all he meets, treats the whole world, the King included,
"à la mode de Billingsgate."</p>

<p>Care's poem is only less stupid than the ponderous <i>Some Reflections upon
a late poem, by a Person of Honour</i>, which appeared a few days later. The
Person of Honour was Dryden's old enemy, the Duke of Buckingham.
Goaded to exasperation by the onslaught made upon him in <i>Absalom and
Achitophel</i>, Buckingham set out to overwhelm Dryden under mountains of
moral indignation. He succeeded only in proving conclusively that his own
share in <i>The Rehearsal</i>, in its own way a masterpiece, must have been
extremely small.</p>

<p>Early in 1682 <i>The Reflections</i> were followed by Samuel Pordage's <i>Azaria
and Hushai</i>. Twenty years before Pordage had proved himself the possessor
of a certain ingenuity by his feat of turning the philosophy of Jacob Boehme
into English-rhymed couplets. There are even a few passable passages in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
the <i>Mundorum Explicatio</i>. But in this satire of his later years he seems to
have lost such cunning as he may once have possessed. The sole merit of
the piece is a certain dull restraint of language, an avoidance of the drosser
scurrilities. He is very temperate, for instance, in what he says of Dryden:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The falling glory of the Jewish stage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet was the Muse that did his wit inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had he not let his hackney Muse for hire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Zimri, we know, he had no cause to praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he dubb'd him with the name of Bayes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because he durst with his proud wit engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought his follies on the public stage.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But the next Whig satire to appear has real merits. Settle's <i>Absalom Senior</i>
is the one good thing produced by the Whigs in their battle with Dryden.
Dryden himself had grudgingly to admit that Settle was something of a
poet.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Doeg, though without knowing how or why,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made still a blundering kind of melody;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spurred boldly on and dashed through thick and thin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through sense and nonsense, never out nor in;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Free from all meaning, whether good or bad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a word, heroically mad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was too warm on picking-work to dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But fagoted his notions as they fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if they rhymed and rattled, all was well.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">This is not altogether just. The verse of <i>Absalom Senior</i> does more than
rhyme and rattle; it has a music of its own, and there are passages that are
curiously Elizabethan in their conception and execution. Take, for example,
this character of the Duke of York, the Absalom Senior of the poem:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mercy and the clemency divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those sacred sparks, which in mild David shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were all put out and left a starless night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long farewell to all that's good and brave!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not cataracts more headstrong; as the grave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inexorable; sullen and untuned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As Pride deposed; not Lucifer unthroned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More unforgiving.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It is hardly credible that this should have been written in 1682. It reads like
the work of some minor poet in the "giant age before the flood," a contemporary
of the grave Lord Brooke. Here again is something no poet of
the Restoration has any business to write, a simile in which Settle compares
the papist plotter to the alchemist:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who though he see his bursting limbecks crack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at one blast, one fatal minute's wrack,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forward hope of sweating years expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sad, yet painful, hand new-lights the fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale, lean and wan, does health, wealth, all consume;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the great elixir yet to come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toils and hopes on.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The poem opens with a history of the ceaseless Catholic efforts, ever since
the time of Henry VIII., to recapture England for the old faith. This serves
as a preface to the main body of the piece, which deals with the Popish Plot.
There is the usual portrait gallery, imitated from <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>,
of the most important figures on either side. This spirited description of
Lauderdale is worth quoting:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let not that hideous bulk of honour 'scape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nadab that sets the gazing crowds agape;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old kirk-founder, whose hoarse croak could sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Saints, the Cause, no Bishop and no King.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the triumphant Saul he was employed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A huge fang-tusk to gore poor David's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a proboscis in the tyrant's jaw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rend and root through government and law.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Settle mentions Dryden in connection with Amiel, the Duke of Buckingham.
It is pleasant to note that, like Pordage, he pays tribute, albeit a somewhat
equivocal one, to Dryden's poetical genius:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Amiel had, alas, the fate to hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An angry poet play his chronicler;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A poet rais'd above oblivion's shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his recorded verse immortal made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No muse could more heroic deeds rehearse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">H' had with an equal, all-applauding verse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great David's sceptre and Saul's javelin praised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pyramic to his saint Interest he rais'd.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The rest of the remarks about Dryden are not so edifying; they refer to
that subject, so fruitful of raillery, the poet's marriage with Lady Howard,
whom Settle, repeating scandal, describes as</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Laura, in faithful constancy confined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Ethiop's envoy and to all mankind.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The poem ends with a long list of eulogies addressed to the chiefs of the
Country Party, dull as such eulogies always are and are always bound to be.
For, while we listen to abuse and defamation of almost any kind with pleasure,
we are apt to find the recital of a man's virtues extremely tedious; a fact
well known to newspaper proprietors, for whom moral indignation&mdash;or mud
slinging, for the terms are usually synonymous&mdash;is spiritual meat and drink,
as well as material bread-and-butter.</p>

<p>The publication of <i>Absalom Senior</i> was the high-water mark of Settle's
life. In 1673, at the age of twenty-five, he had all the appearances of a great
man: he was the author of <i>The Empress of Morocco</i>. But he was very definitely
one of those who have had greatness thrust upon them. The success of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
fantastic tragedy, gravely judged by the most advanced undergraduate
opinion of the day to be superior to anything Dryden had written, was
wholly due to the prodigies of log-rolling performed by that shifty and
malicious patron of the arts, Wilmot, Earl of Rochester. Rochester, who had
for a time bestowed his favours upon Dryden, suddenly threw him over
and exalted Elkanah Settle in his place. He had <i>The Empress of Morocco</i>
specially produced at Court before its appearance on the public stage, and
himself contributed a Prologue. The "boom" was so well organised that
the public for a time actually took Elkanah seriously. The Empress and her
infamous gallant, Grimalhaz, stamped about the stage giving rhymed
utterance to sentiments of an unheard of turpitude.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">
<span class="i1d"><span class="in1g"><span class="smcap">Grimalhaz:</span></span> Have you considered, madam, what you've done?<br /></span>

<span class="i1d"><span class="in1e"><span class="smcap">Empress:</span></span> Poisoned my husband, sir, and if you need<br /></span>
<span class="i12d">Examples to instruct you in the deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i12d">I'll make my actions plainer understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i12d">Copying his death on all the royal blood.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="in0">Loud and prolonged applause, bursting out again with redoubled fury when
the Empress hisses into the ear of this new Macbeth:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">and your next step t'a throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must be, dear sir, the murder of my son.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The applause died away and with it the cat-calls of Settle's three envious
rivals, Dryden, Crowne, and Shadwell. Then came <i>Absalom Senior</i>, and
for its author the deserved laureateship of Whiggery. But a year later things
took an awkward turn for the Country Party; Settle recanted and wrote a
history of the Popish Plot, in which he gave Oates his full due as a scoundrel.
When James II. came to the throne he wrote a fawning Coronation Ode
in the hope of placating one whom he had himself so short a time before
called "inexorable as the grave." He even went so far as to publish a panegyric
of Judge Jefferies. Inch by inch he was sinking deeper into the slough
of Grub Street. With the Revolution he gave up politics (they seemed
altogether too unsafe) and applied for the post of City Laureate. Lord
Mayor's Shows were now immortalised to the extent of "living in Settle's
numbers one day more." Grown old and very miserable, he was reduced
to writing puppet plays, better works of art&mdash;who knows?&mdash;than the proud
Empress of his youth; and we find him at last "hissing in his own dragon"
at Bartholomew Fair. He was seventy-six when he died in 1724, having
survived long enough to be the target of Pope's barbed malice.</p>

<p><i>Absalom Senior</i> closes the first act of the drama. The second opens with
Dryden's <i>Medal</i>. This personal attack on Shaftesbury roused more fury
among the Whigs than even <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>. In a single day Edmund
Hickeringill wrote and sent to press a long retort called <i>The Mushroom</i>.
"... And if any man think or say that it is a wonder if this book and verses
were composed and writ in one day, and sent to the press, since it would
employ the pen of a ready writer to copy this book in a day&mdash;it may be so.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
But it is a truth, as certain as the sun in the firmament, and which, if need
be, the bookseller, printer, and other worthy citizens that are privy to it can
avouch for an infallible truth&mdash;<i>Deo soli gloria</i>&mdash;when a divine hand assists,
one of despicable, dull and inconsiderate parts may do wonders, which God
usually performs by most weak and unlikely instruments." Hickeringill is a
charming character; but he hardly comes within the scope of our article.
He is not so much a man of letters as a mental case.</p>

<p>Pordage once again stepped forward and dealt a perfectly ineffective blow.
He was followed by a new and more truculent champion, Shadwell. Shadwell
laid about him with a will. Of Dryden's poetical powers he says condescendingly:
"He has an easiness in rhyme and a knack of versifying and can make
a slight thing seem pretty and clinquant." On the other hand, he is wholly
lacking in originality, and even in his satires has done nothing but "turn
the Observator into rhyme." When he is not writing in rhyme, "in which
he has a kind of excellence," he is completely insipid. He has no sense of
comedy.</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thou never mak'st, but art a standing Jest.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">So much for Dryden's literary reputation; now for his character. At this
point Shadwell throws the moral indignation about so freely that we are
forced to hold our noses and to avert our eyes.</p>

<p>Left scathless by the clumsy grossness of Shadwell's attack, Dryden
retorted murderously with <i>MacFlecknoe</i>.</p>

<p>But enough of Shadwell. He has his meed of fame and recognition. His
body lies in Westminster Abbey and his plays have been resurrected in the
"Mermaid" Edition. Who was Flecknoe? What manner of man was that
grandiose figure who</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In Prose and Verse was own'd without dispute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the realms of Non-sense, absolute?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">There must be many who, like myself, have cherished a sneaking hope that
this is an ungenerous judgment, that Flecknoe is not so bad after all. Might
one not even discover him, edit him, unearth buried beauties? Alas, one has
but to read a few of his many works to realise that Dryden was only speaking
the modest truth!</p>

<p>We catch our first glimpse of him at some date about the year 1645, when
Andrew Marvell, on his travels in Rome, climbed up three pair of stairs and</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">found at last a chamber, as 'twas said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But seemed a coffin set on the stair's head,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">the lodgment of Richard Flecknoe, Irishman, priest, poet, and musician.
A strange figure:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">as thin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stands, as if he only fed had been<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With consecrated wafers, and the Host<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hath sure more flesh and blood than he can boast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This basso-relievo of a man&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, as a camel tall, yet easily can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The needle's eye thread through without any stitch.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">No sooner is Marvell within the basso-relievo's clutches than</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Straight, without further information<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hideous verse, he, in a dismal tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begins to exorcise, as if I were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessed;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">and so it goes on</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Till the tyrant, weary to persecute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left off and tried to allure me with his lute.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Desperate measures have now to be taken; Marvell asks the man to dinner
and for a little time, at least, secures a respite. But not for long; the poet,</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Satisfied with eating, but not tame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns to recite; though judges most severe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After the assizes' dinner, mild appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on full stomach do condemn but few,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet he more strict my sentence doth renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draws out of the black box of his breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ten quire of paper, in which he was dressed.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It is a sad example of that all too frequent inconsistency between a man's
art and life that the best poem Flecknoe ever wrote should be <i>To Silence</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still-born Silence, thou that art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Floodgate of the deeper heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offspring of a heavenly kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frost oth' mouth and thaw oth' mind.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">There is a certain absurd charm about this reckless mixture of conceits, a
charm which would have melted Marvell's heart, if he had heard the piece,
as it later melted Lamb's. For what is almost the first and the last time,
Flecknoe's poetic method, which is the method of Marvell himself and of
all the seventeenth-century metaphysicals reduced to the absurd, actually
comes off. Only once again was he ever to produce anything faintly resembling
poetry, and that is in this stanza about the ant:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That small republique too, at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where thou'rt perhaps some magistrate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Little think'st thou, when thou dost come,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There's greater in the world than that.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But this is exceptional; his average poetic level is exemplified by such
lines as:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now to the woodlands, now to th' champains, where<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With subtile nets and pitfalls slyly made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She innocently silly fowls betrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the more lofty inhabitants oth' skies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sh' allured to ground with brightness of her eyes,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">or by that astonishing couplet on Phœbus, which runs:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From 's harnessing of 's horses in the East,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto 's unharnessing of them in the West.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">From Rome Flecknoe carried his juvenile verses to Constantinople, to
Portugal, to Brazil, to Flanders. But no amount of travel could cure him of
his fatal habit of writing. Re-established in England after the Restoration,
he turned an unlimited leisure to the worst account. He was the author of
four plays, only one of which was put upon the stage, and that was duly
damned. He contented himself by printing the others with a list of the
actors he would have liked to see in the different parts, if he had been able
to get them performed&mdash;a touching piece of naïveté which does much to
endear him to us.</p>

<p>Of his prose works the most ambitious is a little collection of <i>Enigmaticall
Characters</i>, of which perhaps the choicest is this on the Drunkard. The
Drunkard's wit "is rather the hog's-head than his own, savouring more of
Heidelberg than of Helican and he being rather a drunken than a good
companion."</p>

<p>Flecknoe dies, like the lady on whose decease he wrote an ode, "died as
having nothing else to do," in the year 1678.</p>

<p>Such was Flecknoe. Shadwell's claim to being ranked as Flecknoe's son
is amply substantiated by his own protest that in <i>MacFlecknoe</i> "he had
been represented as an Irishman, though Mr. Dryden knew very well that
he had not set eyes on the country till he was three and twenty and had
remained in it then only for four months."</p>

<p>Dryden followed up <i>MacFlecknoe</i> with the character of Og in the Second
Part of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i>. Shadwell was unable to reply; he could
only faintly complain.</p>

<p>With Part the Second of <i>Absalom and Achitophel</i> the drama of the Popish
Plot comes to an end. The curtain falls on this last orgy of murder. All the
minor characters are now dead&mdash;for Doeg and Mephibosheth lie bleeding
by the side of the monstrous Og&mdash;and only the hero remains alive. Turning
with a bow to the audience, he delivers the epilogue, in which he explains,
with the best of good humour, exactly why it is that he, Dryden, is still
alive and all the rest lie punctured about him.</p>

<p>"How easy it is," so runs the epilogue, "how easy it is to call rogue and
villain, and that wittily! But how hard to make a man appear a fool, a
blockhead, or a knave, without using any of these opprobrious terms!
There is still a vast difference between the slovenly butchering of a man and
the fineness of a stroke that separates the head from the body and leaves it
standing in its place. A man may be capable, as Jack Ketch's wife said of
his servant, of a plain piece of work, a bare hanging; but to make a malefactor
die sweetly was only belonging to her husband. I wish I could apply
it to myself, if the reader would be kind enough to think it belongs to me."</p>

<h2><a name="ARCHITECTURE_AS_FORM_IN" id="ARCHITECTURE_AS_FORM_IN">ARCHITECTURE AS FORM IN
CIVILISATION</a></h2>

<p class="center">By PROFESSOR W. R. LETHABY</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">TOWNS</span> and Civilisation are two words for nearly one thing; the
City is the manifestation of the spirit and its population is the larger
body it builds for its soul. To build cities and live in them properly
is the great business of large associations of men. The outward and
the made must always be exact pictures of the mind and the makers. Not only
is this so at any given stage, but it is so all the more in a going concern, for
the outward is always reacting again on the inward, so that the concrete
becomes a mould for the spiritual. Man builds towns so that the towns shall
build his sons. As the old Greek said, "The city teaches the man."</p>

<p>William Morris says somewhere that the religions of antiquity were the
worshipping of cities. It may seem strange this idea of city worship, but
it explains much in the history of art, and we need something of similar
sort even now: this and other worships besides and beyond. Before the
recognition of the universal and the national we require a much deepened
sense of the civic. <i>Here</i> comes before the <i>Beyond</i>. Almost the greatest
question of the time is the one of finding wells for the refreshment of our
vitality&mdash;the inducing of national spirit, town spirit, and home spirit. Such
spirit is a very subtle essence, and yet it dwells in houses and cities are its
reservoirs. In the Army it has always been recognised that the foundation
of the whole vast violent business is <i>spirit</i>. The children of war are wiser
than the children of peace. As an example take this scrap from the experience
of a new soldier: "The private is taught from the beginning that the first
duty of a soldier is obedience, the second cleanliness, and the third may be
gathered from this short dialogue between a drill sergeant and a squad of
recruits:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"What is the third duty of a soldier?" asks the sergeant. "Honesty, sobriety, and
self-respect," we reply. "And what is self-respect?" "Keeping your buttons
bright."</p></blockquote>

<p>We know that Jerusalem was a sacred city, and so was Athens too in its
way. So indeed were all the cities of antiquity, each in its proper status.
In the later classical age every one had its impersonation of sculptured
image&mdash;the <i>Tyche</i> of the City. Fragments of a figure of Silchester were
found in the Basilica of the old British town; an image which stood for the
genius of the place. London and York were also sacred in those Roman days,
and the figure on our pennies is a similar Roman imagination for the whole
country, <i>Britannia</i>. A fine inscription from Ephesus in the Central Hall of
the British Museum is a delightful example of the forms and ceremonies
observed by the proud cities of antiquity&mdash;the ritual prescribed for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
worship in fact. This marble slab, about 7 feet by 3½ feet, bears in large clear
lettering the copy of a letter addressed by Antoninus Pius to the Magistrates
and People of Ephesus <i>c.</i> <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 140. The emperor approved that the
people of Pergamon had written letters to Ephesus correctly addressed with
the prescribed titles (First and Greatest Metropolis of Asia, or the like).
He thinks that the People of Smyrna had accidentally omitted this from a
decree about joint sacrifice, but they will behave correctly in future provided
that the Ephesians use the approved titles in writing to Smyrna (pre-eminent
in beauty or the like). This is indeed politeness on a high plane.</p>

<p>One of the ways in which civic spirit, pride, and love must be refounded
is in the sense of historical continuity. Such a sense of regional reverence
is being cultivated in France on a definitely psychological basis, and those
alert Americans have already begun to work the ground of their antiquities.
A publication of a local historical society, issued as far back as 1900, contains
an account of what they in America call "An Old Ipswich House." It
begins with some words which I must quote: "The extraordinary production
and large circulation of the historical novel is but one of the consequences
of the remarkable growth of patriotic societies in this country in the last
few years. One of the most admirable results of the movement is the widespread
interest in the establishment of local historical societies in the old
towns of New England. [Older towns of Old England, please note and copy.]
These societies have a very fascinating work before them in the collection
of local records, the preservation of old buildings, in the marking of historic
sites. This soil is fertile and delving therein bears rich fruit of interest, love
for the community, heightened civic feeling, encouragement of local improvement,
and a care for the future of the town. In not a few places the local
society has taken some old house for its headquarters, adorning it with
attractive historical collections. Such a collection is that of the Bostonian
Society, to which the city long ago gave the use of the Old State House."
What might our English towns still do in this way! Or is it to be that for
authentic touch with antiquity we shall soon have to go to America? In
passing may I commend this idea to those who have the destruction of the
old Dean's House at Wolverhampton in their mind or at least their power?</p>

<p>Germany has long consciously cultivated this field for spirit production,
and I remember an official tract on the psychological value of Ancient Monuments
in promoting national consciousness. It is in Denmark, however,
that an effort to promote national spirit has been most systematically based
on a common knowledge of national traditions, arts, and music, and spread
by means of their admirable "Folk Schools."</p>

<p>Monumental history is a stirring, vital thing: it can be touched. In every
town every child-citizen should know the story and antiquities of that place.
This has always been the way until now. "What mean these stones?"
the children say, and we answer, "I don't know." The history that can be
seen is a strong and stimulating soul-food, entirely different from vague
and wearying written history.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
The historical starting-post is only one of many ways of approach to fine
forms of civilisation; we must not wait on the order of our going, but go at
once and from every point at once. Much is being thought and said about
Housing and Town Planning; they are both of the greatest possible importance,
but they are not all. We need at least a third to go with them&mdash;that is
a general cleaning, tidying, and smartening movement, an effort to improve
all our public and social arts, from music to cooking and games. We must
control and tax advertisements to some order, bring pressure on the railway
companies to sweep the microbes out of their stations, and we must whitewash
our own backyards. The danger is to think of housing and planning
as technical matters for experts. It may almost be feared that current talk
of town planning and garden cities may harden with a jargon-like political
formulæ. Our arts and customs are indexes and pictures of our inner life.
Fine bridges, clean, smiling streets, liberal public buildings are not merely
shapes and nothing more. They are essential to our sense of order, brightness,
and efficiency, to our pride, confidence, and content. A sore protesting
slapped-in-the-face feeling cannot be good for the temper and digestion.
A civilised life cannot be lived in undisciplined towns.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>More and more we become the victims of our words and live frightened
by names. Such a name is Architecture. In its mystery vague and vain
pretensions may be shrouded, in its shadows hide many minor superstitions
about correct design, the right style, true proportions. High priests arise
who are supposed to know subtle doctrines and can point the way to æsthetic
safety. And yet all the time there are the streets, Edgware Road and Euston
Road, Oxford Street and Holborn; there again are our cities, Leeds and
Liverpool, Bristol and Plymouth. Surely these potent and indeed blatant
facts might raise doubts as to the dogmas. The mystification about "architecture"
has isolated the intimate building art from the common interest
and understanding of ordinary men. To talk with a believing architect on
his theories is almost as hopeless as to chaff a cardinal. All the ancient arts
of men are subject to the diseases of pedantry and punditry&mdash;music, painting,
poetry all suffer from isolation.</p>

<p>Architecture is human skill and feeling shown in the great necessary
activity of building. It must be a living, progressive structural art,
always readjusting itself to changing conditions of time and place. If
it is true it must ever be new. This, however, not with a willed novelty,
which is as bad as or worse than trivial antiquarianism, but by response to <i>force
majeure</i>. The vivid interest and awe with which men look on a ship or an
engine, an old cottage or a haystack, come from the sense of their reality.
They were shaped so by a higher power than whim, by a higher aim than
snobbery. So must it again be with our buildings: they must be founded
fast on the rock of necessity.</p>

<p>Wordy claims are often made for "Architecture" that it is a "Fine Art,"
and chief of all the arts. These two claims are indeed incompatible and contradictory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
Any mastership in architecture depends on its universality and
its service. It is only chief in the sense that he who serves is the greatest.
But the "Fine Arts" are by definition free from conditions of human
need, and architecture was specially ruled out from among them by Aristotle.
Even so, this idea of fine art unconditioned and free for delight was a heresy
of the Hellenistic decline. To Plato and the great masters even the "musical"
arts were to be not only healthy but health-giving; they were to be foods
for the soul and not æsthetic raptures and intoxications.</p>

<p>On the other side of the account it may be objected that bare utility and
convenience are not enough to form a base for a noble architecture. Of
course they are not if "bare utility" is interpreted in a mean and skimping
and profiteering way. All work of man bears the stamp of the spirit with
which it was done, but this stamp is not necessarily "ornament." The
unadorned indeed can never stand as low as that which is falsely adorned in
borrowed, brazen bedizenments. High utility and liberal convenience for
noble life are enough for architecture. We confuse ourselves with these
unreal and destructive oppositions between the serviceable and the æsthetic,
between science and art. Consider any of the great forms of life activity&mdash;seamanship,
farming, housekeeping&mdash;can anyone say where utility ends and
style, order, clearness, precision begin? Up to a point, and indeed a long
way on, "style" is a utility. We have to begin again and look on architecture
as an art of service from the communal point of view. The faces of buildings
which are turned outwards towards the world are obviously of interest to
the public, and all citizens have a property in them. The spectator is in fact
part owner. No man builds to himself alone. Let the proprietor do as he
likes inside his building, for we need not call on him. Bad plays need not be
seen, books need not be read, but nothing but blindness or the numbing of
our faculty of observation can protect us from buildings in the street. It
is to be feared that we are learning to protect ourselves by the habit of not
observing, that is by sacrificing a faculty. General interest and intelligent
appreciation of public arts are a necessity of civilisation. Civic alertness,
honest pride, or firm protest are not matters of taste for a few; they are
essential activities of the urban mind. In cities buildings take the place of
fields, trees, and hedgerows. Buildings are an artificial form of nature. We
have a right to consideration and some politeness in buildings. We claim
protection from having our faces slapped when we venture into the street.
Our cities do not wholly belong to profit-lords, railway companies, and
advertisers.</p>

<p>Architecture, however "properly understood," not only concerns the
man in the street, it comes home to all householders and households. While
our eyes have been strained on the vacuity of correct style, the weightier
matters of construction and efficiency have necessarily been neglected. We
need grates which will warm, floors which may readily be cleaned, and
ceilings which do not crack. These and such as these are the terms of the
modern architectural problem, and in satisfying them we should find the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_578" id="Page_578">578</a></span>
proper "style" for to-day. Architecture is a current speech, it is not an art
of classical quotation. As it is it is as much burdened by its tags of rhetoric
as Chinese literature. It has become a dead language. The house of the
future will be designed as a ship is designed, as an organism which has to
function properly in all its parts. Does this not concern everyone, not only
as economy and comfort, but in the mind? Our houses must be made to
fit us like garments and to be larger projections of ourselves. A whole row
of ambiguous words, such as design, ornament, style, proportion, have come
between us and the immediately given data of architecture. Design is not
abstract power exercised by a genius, it is simply the arranging how work
shall be well done. The more necessary the work and the more obvious,
simple, and sound is the foresight the better the design. It is not a question
of captivating paper patterns, it is a question of buildings which will work.
Architecture is a pragmatical art. To design in the Classic, Gothic, or Renaissance
styles is as absurd as to sculpture in the manner of Praxiteles, paint
"like" Holbein, or write sham Shakespeare. We do not really need a
waxwork art by Wardour Street professionals. We require an active art of
building which will take its "style" for granted, as does naval architecture.
Modern building must shake itself free from its own withered and cast-off
skins.</p>

<p>It is commonly supposed, and architects themselves in older days believed
it, that an architect's business was to be an expert in style. Why he should
be so was never explained, except, perhaps, by Philibert de l'Orme. According
to this authority the Temple of Jerusalem was built in the Classical
style, and this work was designed in heaven; therefore this was the only
true or revealed style. An excellent argument; modern practitioners have
kept up a "battle of the styles" without any such basis for their logic, or
rather their eloquence. But what is or was a style? It is a museum name
for a phase of past art. As a means of classifying what is dead and done the
style labels are quite useful. It has, however, to be kept in mind that these
styles, while they lived and moved, were processes which began, continued,
and passed into something else. They were only phases like those of the
changing moon. That which now professes to be designed in a style, or, as
the still more disgusting slang runs, to be "period work," has not the
essence of life. It is, therefore, not actually of the style which it simulates
but is only in the "style" of the style.</p>

<p>Indeed, the essence of all the old arts was in their vitality, their response
to the natural conditions and the psychology of their times. The better we
seem to reproduce their dead images the more we are unlike their soul-selves.
There is little more reason for an architect to pretend to work in a
style than there is for a chemist. Architects are properly arrangers and
directors of certain classes of structures. I would like to say that they were
building engineers, were it not that our engineers have failed so shamefully
in hiring themselves out for any form of exploitation and in showing no
care for orderliness and decency. All the past of architecture, as of engineering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
and shipbuilding, belongs to us, of course, as race experience, but only
as far as the same is true in all fields of science and literature.</p>

<p>The "Orders" of architecture are names for particular forms of ancient
Greek temple building. Style-names apply to all past fashions of buildings,
Orders only to three&mdash;Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian. The names are useful
as history, but that is all. Now that these Orders have become shop advertisements,
even the would-be correct may be more ready to give them up.</p>

<p>Style in a modern and universal sense is equivalent rather to "stylish"
than to a style; it interpenetrates the whole texture of a work; it is clearness,
effectiveness, mastery, often it is simplification. We have to conceive of it
in the building art as we do in literature or athletics. "The style is the
man"&mdash;yes, and it is also the thing itself. It is an informing spirit, the spirit
of form, it is not a varnish. We have become so accustomed to architecture
looking "dressy" that we have forgotten the logic of clothes and bury
buildings good enough in themselves under outgrown rags. It has been a
true instinct which calls sham architectural features "dressings."</p>

<p>Another word which the architecturally superstitious whisper with great
awe is proportion. In dealing with such a limited field as the "Orders," old
scholars examined existing examples by measuring them very carefully to
find out their proportions; but, if we had them, Greek chairs and tables
might be measured in exactly the same way. No general rule of the Greeks
has ever been found out by these measurings, and if it had it would prove
nothing for us. Proportion, of course, rests properly on function, material,
and size. There maybe a perfect proportion, for instance, for a certain class
of ships, but that will only be discovered experimentally, and not by measuring
Greek galleys.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>I wish I could find some leverage of argument to bring a sense of citizen
responsibility for form in life into the minds and hearts of all, but right and
reason are hardy enough. We may, perhaps, hope more in a sense of international
rivalry in the works and evidences of life. Civilisation is an Olympic
contest in the arts and sciences, a sort of international Eisteddfod. It is
admitted that we must have literature and we must have music: we must
also have building skill, and we have to aim at inducing a flowing tide in all
the things of civilisation. Of words and arguments I am rather hopeless.
One thing only I would ask of every benevolent reader: that he would take
notice of what he sees in the streets. Do not pass by in a contemplative dream,
or suppose that it is an architectural mystery, but look and judge. Is it tidy,
is it civilised, are these fit works for a proud nation? Look at Trafalgar
Square and Piccadilly Circus, and that terrible junction of Tottenham
Court Road with Oxford Street. Play a new game of seeing London. We
need a movement in the common mind, a longing to mitigate the vulgarity
and anarchy of our streets, and the smothering of the frontages with vile
advertisements, a desire to clean the streets better, to gather up littered
paper, to renew blistered plaster. Some order must be brought into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
arrangement of the untidy festoons of telegraph and telephone wires
hitched up to chimneys and parapets. These are the architectural works which
are needed as a beginning and a basis. The idea of beauty, daily-bread beauty,
not style pretences, must be brought back into our life. Every town should
set up an advisory committee on its betterment. We must try to bring back
the idea of town personality and town worship; we must set up ceremonies
and even rituals to bring out a spirit of pride and emulation. If we can only
stir up general interest all will yet go well or at least better. By exalting
our towns we should make a platform for ourselves. As it is what can great
money fortunes buy beyond swine comfort and titles? Man is more than a
stomach moving about on legs. A mistake of modern education has been to
train for appreciation of the past rather than for present production. Such
merely critical learning comes at last to be actually sterilising. As production
fails, so even appreciation decays. Full understanding depends on the power
to do. Therefore, leaving the things of the past, press forward to produce,
to be, to live. Remember Lot's wife. There is much talk of patriotism, but
patriotism requires a ground on which to subsist; it must be based on love
of home, love of city, and love of country. Let nothing deceive us, civilisation
produces form, and where noble form is attained there is civilisation.
Life is a process, a flow of being, and where there is this vital activity
music, drama, and the arts are necessarily thrown off. Living art comes on
a tide of creative intelligence.</p>

<h3 class="left">GENERAL NOTES</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">WE</span> have just received the catalogue of the library of the late Dr. Daniel,
Provost of Worcester, which was bought in its entirety by Mr. Chaundy,
of Oxford. Dr. Daniel, who died in the autumn of last year, was born
in 1836. From boyhood onwards his favourite hobby seems to have been
printing. "As early as 1846 a small hand press at Frome Vicarage, in
Somerset, painfully produced a little letter, and in 1852 at least three numbers of the
Busy Bee, printed and published by H. and W. E. Daniel, at their office, Trinity
Parsonage, Frome." In 1856 two more substantial volumes (<i>Sonnets</i>, by C. J. C., and
<i>The Seven Epistles to the Churches</i>, in Greek) were issued from Frome.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>So much for origins. The Daniel Press known to fame only came into existence in
1874, when the little hand press from Frome was set up in Worcester. The first book
printed by the Daniel Press, at Oxford, was <i>Notes from a Catalogue of Pamphlets in
Worcester College Library</i>, 1874, of which five-and-twenty copies were issued. A copy
of this pamphlet is priced at 45<i>s.</i> in Mr. Chaundy's catalogue. <i>A New Sermon of the
Newest Fashion</i>, printed from a MS. found in the College Library, appeared in 1877.
In this volume Dr. Daniel first made use of the fount of type which had been cast for
Dr. Fell, Dean of Christ Church, and which had lain forgotten in the Clarendon Press
for a century and a half. Henceforth Dr. Daniel was to make use of the Fell type in all
his publications.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The most treasured book of these earlier years is the <i>Garland of Rachel</i> (1881),
which consists of poems offered to Miss Rachel Daniel on her first birthday by, among
others, Andrew Lang, Austen Dobson, Robert Bridges, John Addington Symonds,
Edmund Gosse, W. E. Henley, T. Humphry Ward, and Margaret L. Woods. Only
thirty-six copies were printed, one of which is priced in Mr. Chaundy's catalogue at
£40.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In 1882 the old press was replaced by a much more scientific machine, and among
the first books to be printed on the new press was <i>Prometheus the Firegiver</i> (1883), by
Robert Bridges. A number of the Poet Laureate's poems were to be issued from the
Daniel Press. Of the <i>Poems</i> of 1884 one hundred and fifty copies were printed (£3 10<i>s.</i>
in Mr. Chaundy's catalogue). <i>The Feast of Bacchus</i> (one hundred and five copies) and
<i>The Growth of Love</i>, published anonymously in an edition of only twenty-two copies,
appeared in 1889. The year 1903 witnessed the publication of two more pieces from
Mr. Bridges' pen, namely, <i>Now in Wintry Delights</i> and <i>Peace, an Ode written on Conclusion
of the Three Years' War</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
In 1884 Dr. Daniel made use for the first time of a number of fine seventeenth-century
woodcut ornaments. His printer's mark was a piece of contemporary work,
designed by Alfred Parsons, representing Daniel in the lions' den, with the motto,
<i>Misit Angelum Suum</i>.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Noteworthy volumes which issued from the Daniel Press in the nineties were <i>Our
Memories, Shades of Old Oxford</i> (1893), a collection of Oxford reminiscences by various
hands; <i>The Child in the House</i> (1894), by Walter Pater, published only a month or two
before his death; <i>Poems of Laurence Binyon</i> (1895); <i>Keble's Easter Day</i>, of which only
twelve copies were printed by Miss Rachel Daniel (1897). Eight years before Miss
Daniel had printed <i>The Lamb</i>, by W. Blake, in duodecimo (1889).</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Besides those already mentioned, Dr. Daniel issued a number of reprints of old books.
<i>Sixe Idillia</i>, translated from Theocritus by E. D. (possibly Dyer), was reprinted from
the unique copy (1588) in the Bodleian Library. <i>Love's Graduate</i>, a comedy, by John
Webster, being Mr. Gosse's distillation of what was Websterian in the Webster-Rowley
comedy of 1661, appeared in 1885. <i>The Muses Garden of Delights</i>, a reprint of a unique
Elizabethan volume, edited with an introduction by William Barclay Squire, was printed
by Dr. Daniel in 1901. Another edition, printed by the Clarendon Press, was published
in the same year.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>We have mentioned only a few of the Daniel books. A complete bibliography of the
publications of the Press during its first thirty years of activity may be found in an article
by Mr. Madan, at that time Sub-Librarian of the Bodleian, contributed to the <i>Times
Literary Supplement</i> of February 20th, 1903. As we have already had occasion to mention
in these columns, the Daniel Press is now in the Bodleian, together with specimens of
the books produced on it.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Contemporary private presses are fairly numerous. The two which produce what
are, from a literary point of view at any rate, the most interesting books are the Hogarth
Press and the Ovid Press. From the Ovid Press Mr. John Rodker has just issued a very
handsome edition of the poems of Mr. T. S. Eliot. Poems by Mr. Eliot have also been
published by the Hogarth Press, together with works in verse and prose by Virginia
and Leonard Woolf, Katherine Mansfield, and J. Middleton Murry.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Our French allies seem to be making a serious effort to break with that tradition of
bad printing which has for so long oppressed their literature. Several new publishing
houses have come into existence with the avowed purpose of producing books that
shall be handsome objects in themselves. The directors of the <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i>
have set a higher standard in their publications than most of their rivals. But even in
their editions the most horrible atrocities, such as the omission of a whole sheet of
sixteen pages in the middle of a book, occasionally happen. But the books produced by
<i>La Sirène</i>, by <i>La Belle Edition</i>, and the <i>Société Littéraire de France</i> are worthy of all
praise.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The selection of rare and valuable books from the Arbury Hall Library which, as
announced in the January number of <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>, was to have been offered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
for sale by auction at Sotheby's on behalf of the owner, Sir Francis Newdigate-Newdegate,
K.C.M.G., has instead been sold privately. Neither the name of the purchaser
nor the destination of the books has yet been made public. Since the collection contains
editions of Elizabethan books of the utmost rarity, and indeed some that are apparently
unique, it is to be hoped that it will not pass beyond the reach of students of literature.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Collectors of Swinburniana will be interested in <i>A Catalogue of the Works of Algernon
Charles Swinburne in the Library of Mr. Edmund Gosse</i>, London, privately printed at
the Chiswick Press, 1919. Only fifty copies of this catalogue have been issued, of which
a few can still be obtained from Mr. James Bain, bookseller, 14 King William Street,
Strand.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Many items of the greatest rarity are included in Mr. Gosse's collection. Among
them we would note one of the fifteen copies of <i>The Devil's Due</i> (1875), preserved by
accident when the issue was destroyed; <i>Laus Veneris</i>, Moxon, 1866, one of a few trial
copies issued before the poem was included in <i>Poems and Ballads</i>; the essay on William
Blake, Hotten, 1868, with the original title-page, afterwards cancelled, ornamented by
the vignette of Zamiel from the Book of Job; <i>The Jubilee</i>, <i>The Question</i>, <i>Gathered
Songs</i>, all three published by Ottley in 1887, in editions of only twenty-five copies each.
Among the Swinburne MSS. in the possession of Mr. Gosse are the holograph of
<i>Pan and Thalassia</i>, and the holograph of the first draft of <i>Anactoria</i>.</p>

<p>The new Public Libraries Bill, which received the Royal Assent in the last days of
1919, should do much to assist the development of what is already an important educative
force. We look forward in time to a national library system, with a central clearing
house of books and a free interchange between the individual libraries. It is surely only
in this way that the multifarious needs of an increasingly alert and well-educated
society can adequately be met.</p>

<p>Tuesday, March 23rd, is the date fixed for the sale of the second portion of Mr.
Henry Yates Thompson's collection of illuminated manuscripts. Thirty-four lots
are to be sold&mdash;twenty-six MSS. and eight fifteenth-century books, printed on vellum
and more or less illuminated, "which mark the transition from writing to printing ...
and are an indispensable addition to any complete collection of medieval illumination."</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The first fourteen lots are English manuscripts. A twelfth-century book, <i>Hegesippus
de excidio Judeorum</i>, is remarkable for its contemporary binding, one of the very few
of such bindings which have come down to us. Lot XL. is a fourteenth-century Psalter,
which appears to have belonged to John of Gaunt, and subsequently to Henry VI. A
similar Psalter, evidently by the same hand, though of a rather later date, exists in the
library of Exeter College. These two Psalters are, in Mr. Yates Thompson's opinion,
the high-water mark of English illumination, being perhaps second only to the St. Omer
Psalter.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The eight printed books range in date from 1466 to 1498, and include a copy of the
excessively rare <i>Institutiones</i> of Justinian, printed at Mainz by P. Schöffer, 1468. The
twelve MSS. which conclude the sale are of French and Italian origin and have all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
belonged to famous owners. Among them is an early fifteenth-century MS. of Boccaccio's
<i>Des Cleres et nobles femmes</i>, illustrated by miniatures of that Parisian school of illuminators
who "almost renounced the use of gold for backgrounds and made use of bright and
rich colours in broad masses." The book belonged to the Admiral de Coëtivy, who was
killed at the siege of Cherbourg in 1450. Mr. Yates Thompson quotes an extract from
one of the Admiral's letters, which proves him to have been an ardent lover of his books.
"Envelopez bien mes livres," he writes to his servants, giving directions for the packing
and dispatching of his library, "et les faites enfoncer en pippes (casks) en et par manière
que s'ilz cheoient en l'eaue, qu'ilz ne se puissent mouller ne gaster en aucune manière."</p>

<p>An extremely elegant little catalogue of old editions of Greek and Latin authors
has been sent to us from the "Aedes Dunsteri, Cantabrigiæ, Novang," or in other
words the Dunster House Bookshop, Cambridge, Mass. No word in the vulgar tongue
is allowed to pollute these classical pages, where everything, with the exception of the
dollar sign in the prices, is the choicest Latin.</p>

<p>We have already had occasion to speak of the Daniel and other private Presses. We
are reminded by Messrs. Maggs Brothers' catalogue, No. 385, of the magnificent
examples of typography and binding which have issued from the Doves Press and
Bindery. A copy of <i>Paradise Lost and Paradise Regained</i>, two volumes, 1902&ndash;1905,
printed at the Doves Press and bound by Mr. Cobden Sanderson in tooled morocco,
is priced at £120. None of the fifteen Doves Press books mentioned in this catalogue
is priced at less than £8 8<i>s.</i> Collectors will remember the "boom" in Kelmscott
books.</p>

<p>Good prices were fetched at Messrs. Hodgson's sale on January 28th for first editions
of Stevenson. <i>An Inland Voyage</i> (1878) was sold for £22; <i>Travels with a Donkey</i> (1879)
and <i>Virginibus Puerisque</i> (1881) went for £16 10<i>s.</i> each. First editions of the <i>Ebb Tide</i>
(1894) and <i>The Wrong Box</i> (1889) may be bought for 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> at Messrs. Davis &amp; Orioli.</p>

<p>Messrs. Sotheran's catalogue of the library of the late Sir Edward Poynter, P.R.A.,
has just reached us. Out of the many items of the greatest interest which this catalogue
contains we can mention only a few, notably a fine set of Piranesi etchings, a collection
of 250 caricatures by such masters as Hogarth, Bunbury, Gilray, and Rowlandson
(£75), a copy of Blake's Illustrations to the Book of Job, presented by Mrs. Opie to the
French sculptor, David, with the inscription, "This work, remarkable both for its
genius and extravagance, is the gift of Amelia Opie to her friend David, whose own
genius will make him prize the former, while his excellent taste makes it impossible
for him to imitate the latter." A complete set of the Kelmscott publications, seventy
volumes in all, is priced in this catalogue at £900. The main bulk of the collection
consists of books on the fine arts, and a certain number of original drawings are included.</p>

<p>You emphasize the unsatisfactory status of the American copyright law. It is the
case, as you point out, that the provision inserted in the original International Act which
went into effect in 1891, and in the amended Act which became law in 1909, makes it
a condition that any book, whether by an American or an English author, must, in
order to secure copyright protection in the United States, be published in an edition
"wholly manufactured" within this country. It has also been the law up to within the
past fortnight that the American edition must be brought into the market within a
term of not less than sixty days from the date of publication in Great Britain.</p>

<p>This Act, as amended in 1912 and again in December, 1919, represents the largest
measure of copyright protection that it has thus far been found practicable to secure
for transatlantic authors. The fight to secure any measure of recognition for the property
rights of foreign authors had continued from 1837 (when my father organised the first
Copyright League) to 1891, when a provision for international copyright first found
place in the American statute. I succeeded my father as the Secretary and executive
of the International Copyright League.</p>

<p>As a representative of this League (which at that time comprised authors as well as
publishers) I took to Washington in 1886 the draft of a Bill which, if enacted, would
have enabled the United States to become a member of the Convention of Berne.
After four years of effort with two successive Congresses, I was obliged to report to
the Copyright League that there was no possibility of securing favourable attention for
any international copyright measure that did not make provision for American manufacture.</p>

<p>The Book Manufacturing Union, comprising typesetters, printers, binders, etc., had
made clear to Congress that they would block the enactment of any measure that did
not include the manufacturing requirement. In this position they were supported by
the other unions which had no direct interest in, and in fact no knowledge of, the
matter at issue. The unions have, wisely, probably for their own interests, held
increasingly to the policy of giving a general support to a claim made by any one union
or group.</p>

<p>Our League took the position that it was wiser to secure such measure of recognition
for literary property as was then practicable rather than to leave without protection
the books of transatlantic authors, and the authors and publishers of Great Britain were
in full accord with this decision.</p>

<p>We are obliged to report that the unions have to-day a stronger influence over
Congress, and as a rule over the executive, than they had in 1890. There is no possibility
of securing the cancellation of the manufacturing requirement unless, or until,
the book manufacturing unions can be persuaded to give their assent. There has been
an increasing effort to this end, and we hope yet to be able to make clear to the book
manufacturing trade that the American printers and binders are now quite strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
enough to secure their full share of the work done, and that they do not need this special
restriction in their favour.</p>

<p>We have just succeeded in securing the enactment of an amendment, a copy of which
is enclosed.</p>

<p>This amendment has two purposes:</p>

<p>First:&mdash;The extension of the <i>ad interim</i> term of copyright from sixty to 120 days.</p>

<p>An English author now has four months' time within which to complete the arrangements
for his American edition, and there is no reason why any book having value for
American readers should not secure the full protection of American copyright.</p>

<p>Second:&mdash;The Bill has the further purpose of giving protection to the books of
transatlantic authors which, under the special conditions of the years of war and the
dislocation of transatlantic mails, had failed to fulfil the requirements of the copyright
law. These books, as far as they may not already have been appropriated, are now
placed in a position to meet these requirements and to secure copyright for the full
term. It is, however, a condition of this special protection that the British authorities
shall give reciprocal protection to books by American authors which, under the same
war conditions, have failed to meet the requirements of the English statute and have,
therefore, forfeited the protection of the British Copyright Act.</p>

<p>The American authors have here a fair ground for complaint against Great Britain.</p>

<p>The British Act of 1912 provides that copyright protection will be accorded only to
a book which has been brought into <i>bona-fide</i> publication, and the Courts take the ground
that this means placing "adequate supplies" of the book in the market within the
term specified, fourteen days. This term is, you will note, very much smaller than the sixty-day
term granted in the earlier American Act, or the 120 days which are now available.</p>

<p>In 1916 books were included under the heading of <i>luxuries</i>, the importation of which
into Great Britain was prohibited by the embargo Act. Great Britain had, therefore,
granted copyright with one hand and with the other, under this embargo Act, had made
it impossible for American authors to meet the requirements of the Copyright Act.
The copyright arrangement between the United States and Great Britain that went
into effect in 1891, and that was confirmed by the Act of 1912, carried with it the obligations
of a treaty, and the embargo Act constituted, therefore, as far as copyright was
concerned, a violation of the treaty obligation.</p>

<p>I found, in bringing this matter in 1918 to the attention of the Comptroller-General,
that this consideration had not occurred to the British authorities at the time of the
embargo Act.</p>

<p>I pointed out to the Comptroller-General that as a result of this embargo provision
property rights had been lost not only for American authors, but for a certain group
of British authors who, not being able under the manufacturing difficulties of the war
period to secure prompt publication of their books in Great Britain, had made first
publication in the United States. In so doing they had forfeited their British copyright,
although it had been their impression that they would be able when the war had
come to an end to secure protection for British editions. The Comptroller-General
agreed that the condition was unsatisfactory, and agreed further that if the United
States would do what was now practicable to protect the publications of the war period
a similar protection of books of American authors would be arranged for by the British
authorities.</p>

<p>A fortnight back, on the day on which the President signed the Bill, I cabled the
report to the Comptroller-General that books by British authors issued during the war
period would be protected in America as soon as the British authorities were prepared
to grant reciprocal protection. I hope to hear that prompt measures have been taken to
such effect. Lord Askwith has, I may mention, interested himself in the matter and will,
I understand, take prompt action to initiate the necessary legislation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
I can but think that those who are critical of the present status of the American
copyright law should understand that the unsatisfactory provisions in the law do not
represent the opinion of the American people, but the disproportioned influence of
the manufacturing unions. It would be in order also to give some measure of appreciation
to the American publishers and authors who have for many years been doing what
was in their power to secure adequate recognition for literary property on both sides
of the Atlantic.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h3>MR. STURGE MOORE AND FLAUBERT</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;In the review of Mr. W. K. Seymour's <i>Miscellany of Poetry</i>&mdash;1919 (<span class="smcap">London
Mercury</span>, February) the best thing in the book is said to be "a long epistle by Mr.
Sturge Moore, which contains pictures as clean-cut and vivid as those which made his
<i>Micah</i> so peculiarly rich a poem." This is, of course, a very just remark, but it is a curious
thing about <i>Micah</i> that the particular piece of imagery which struck one reader at any
rate can be paralleled almost verbatim from <i>Salammbo</i>. I intend no discourtesy to Mr.
Sturge Moore when I say that I consider the parallel should have been acknowledged
in the text. He has written much about Flaubert and much also about the virtues of
joint authorship, and I think nothing but praise for what is apparently a verse translation
in <i>Micah</i> would have resulted from the acknowledgment. As the matter stands
it seems that an explanation of some sort is wanting, and I suggest that when <i>Micah</i> is
published in a collection of Mr. Moore's poetry the point should surely not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The following are the lines referred to:</p>

<p><i>Salammbo:</i></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Le toit de la haute maison s'appuie sur de minces colonnettes, rapprochées comme
les bâtons d'une claire-voie, et par ces intervalles le maître, étendu sur un long siége,
aperçoit toutes ces plaines autour de lui, avec les chasseurs entre les blés, le pressoir
où l'on vendange, les bœufs qui battent la paille."</p></blockquote>

<h3>JOHN DONNE</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. Robert Lynd in his very readable essay on <i>Donne</i> in your last number
has inadvertently fallen into the old error of saying that Donne was in 1612 "making
use of his legal knowledge in order to help the infamous Countess of Essex to secure the
annulment of her first marriage." It is true that Donne wrote an Epithalamium for the
Countess's second marriage, and that is mortifying enough without any further charge.
But Professor Grierson pointed out some time since that it was Dr. Daniel Donne (or
Dun) who drew up the paper referred to (Grierson's <i>Donne</i>, ii. 94). If further evidence
were needed, it might be supplied from MS. Rawlinson 1386 in the Bodleian. On
page 201 is the autograph <i>Daniel Dun</i>, and someone, probably Rawlinson, has added
"Sr. Daniel Dr of Civil Lawes concern'd in Somerset's Divorce."</p>

<p>Mr. Lynd very rightly insists that John Donne is "the supreme example of a Platonic
lover among the English poets." But he implies that the impassioned logic of <i>The
Ecstasy</i> is not quite consistent with Platonism. What is Platonism? It is customary
to develop a system of philosophy of love from a few famous pages of the <i>Symposium</i>,
ignoring the rest, and this more or less hypothetical or mythical Platonism has caused
many people to forget Plato's real teaching. A careful study of the <i>Symposium</i> will, I
think, show Donne to be much more truly in the genuine Platonic tradition than were
some of the poetical Platonists who preceded him. Mr. Lynd is quite right on this point,
and I think he might have put it even more strongly.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h3>DOGS</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your reviewer in his notice of that interesting book <i>Seventeenth Century Life
in the Country Parish</i>, referring to the "dog-whipper," says, "But why did the dogs of
those days show such a church-going disposition?" I would remind him that the
dog-whipper's office was not created in the seventeenth century, but in those remoter
times when no gentleman appeared anywhere in public without his hawk on his wrist
and his hound at his heel. In Barclay's <i>Shippe of Fools</i> (1509) he writes:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One time the hawkes bells jangleth hye<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<span class="i0">They make of the Church for their hawkes a mewe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And canell for their dogges, which they shall after rewe.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It was the custom to supply a pew (or pen) for the dogs of the Lord of the Manor&mdash;the
hall-dogs' "pew"&mdash;and as people worshipped (in their hats) with the church doors
standing open, I suppose the hounds of the lesser gentry and inimitative yeomen would
run in and fight and distract attention.</p>

<p>Though in the seventeenth century the hawk had ceased to be an integral part of a
gentleman's equipage, the dogs had inherited the tradition of taking their masters to
church, maybe. And as the worshipper, even in the seventeenth century, went from
Divine service to a bull or bear-baiting, he would like to have his dogs on the spot.
And no doubt all the curs of the village would want to follow them into church and
ask the news of high life.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h2>LEARNED SOCIETIES, <span class="smcap">Etc.</span></h2>

<h3 class="left">THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">INTEREST</span> in the Near East is maintained, and a useful lead was given in 1913
by the Cyprus Government, who entrusted Professor Myres, assisted by the
Keeper of the Cyprus Museum and Mr. L. H. D. Buxton, with a good round
sum to conduct excavations in the island. The results were described at length
and illustrated on the screen, the most notable discovery being a ruined sanctuary
containing a collection of stone statues with many of the painted surfaces in
brilliant preservation, ranging in date from the seventh century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> to Greco-Roman
times. Elsewhere many antiquities of the Bronze Age were brought to light, but at
present there are few, if any, traces of a Stone Age in the island. The first stratified
series of Cypriote pottery was provided by a complete section of the Bamboula Hill at
Larnaca, and the situation is full of promise.</p>

<p>A marble statuette, now in the Ashmolean Museum, was the text of Professor
Langdon's discourse, and gave scope for surmise as well as scholarship. It was found
by the 14th Sikh Regiment when entrenching before the battle of Istabalat, eight miles
below Samara on the Tigris. The object originally carried on the head has
disappeared, but the standing figure still holds a "boomerang" or sceptre, and the
dress was made in imitation of the fleece, a fashion to which Aristophanes is supposed
to refer in the <i>Wasps</i>, perhaps three thousand years later. Various prehistoric
specimens from England exhibited to the Society have an interest of their own, but
cannot compete with relics from the cradle of civilisation, and at present the watch-word
is <i>Ex oriente lux</i>.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND</h3>

<p>The third of a series of lectures arranged by the Egypt Exploration Fund (to which
we referred in our December number) was given at the rooms of the Royal Society
at Burlington House on January 23rd, by Professor T. Eric Peet. The subject of the
lecture was "El Amarna, the City of Egypt's Heretic King." The lecturer said that
from the evidence of the mummy generally supposed to be his, Amenhotep IV.
appears to have been little more than a boy when his father died. Nevertheless, as early
as the fourth year of his reign, he introduced the worship of the Aton, the Disk of the
Sun, and did his utmost to establish it as the State religion, and to suppress the worship
of Amon and all other Egyptian gods. The new religion was purely monotheistic in
character, for the Aton was regarded as the creator, not of Egypt only, but of the world.
The new deity was represented in the art of the period by a picture of the disk of
the sun, from which emanated numerous rays, each terminating in human hands,
some of which are holding out the sign of life to the worshippers. The king changed
his own name from Amenhotep ("Amon is content") to Akhenaton ("The Disk is
pleased"), and he shifted his capital from Thebes to El Amarna.</p>

<p>Excavations at El Amarna have brought to light remains of a temple dedicated to
the Aton, and a palace erected for the use of the king, with beautifully painted floor,
fragments of which show a freedom of drawing and lack of convention which distinguish
this period from most other Egyptian art. The remains of many private houses
have also been discovered, and from these it is comparatively easy to gather the size,
design, and general construction of the houses of the nobles of that time. Most of them
seem to have been built on the same plan, and comprise a central hall, with small
apartments surrounding and leading from it. Some of these smaller rooms were used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_591" id="Page_591">591</a></span>
as workrooms, and in one house excavated a number of plaster casts were found,
obviously taken from living models, proving that the Egyptians of this period were
experts in this work. There were also many finished and unfinished statues of the
Royal family, some of which were in very natural positions, quite unlike the usual
Egyptian statues of other sites.</p>

<p>The tombs of the officials of the Court were discovered in the cliffs behind the town,
their walls being covered with sculptured scenes depicting the everyday life of the capital.</p>

<p>At the close of the lecture the Chairman, Colonel H. G. Lyons, F.R.S., pointed out
the extreme importance of systematic and scientific excavations in Egypt and other
countries, and the gains which might accrue to science.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE GEOLOGISTS' ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p>At the meeting held at University College, Gower Street, W.C.1, on Friday, December
5th, 1919, the following lecture was delivered: "Geological Work on the Western
Front," by W. B. R. King, B.A., F.G.S. A short description was given of the geology
of that part of Belgium and France over which military operations were conducted by
the British Armies between 1915 and the summer of 1918. It was mainly confined to
the lithological divisions and did not deal with the palæontological side of the subject.
The main physical features were taken, showing how they are connected with the
geological structure. The effect of the geology and geological structure on certain questions
of military operations was dealt with, notably with regard to water supply and military
mining and dug-out construction. Particular attention was paid to the problem of
obtaining water from boreholes in the Landenien (Thanet) sands, the causes and effect
of the seasonal variation of water-level in the chalk, and the problem of the military
mines near Messines, Givenchy-les-la-Bassée, and Souchez. The lecture ended with a
description of certain maps which were prepared for the armies in France, and notes on
several other problems which had to be dealt with by the geologists attached to General
Headquarters.</p>

<p>On Friday, January 2nd, 1920, Dr. A. E. Trueman, F.G.S., read a paper on "The
Liassic Rocks of the Cardiff District." The author said that the greater part of South
Glamorganshire, from Cardiff westwards to beyond Bridgend, consists of lower Liassic
rocks (Hettangian and Lower Sinemurian), which are well seen in some 20 miles of
magnificent cliff sections. Only meagre descriptions of these rocks have been hitherto
published. A detailed study has been undertaken, first because nowhere else in this
country are such continuous sections of these rocks available, and, secondly, because the
normal deposits consisting of limestones and shales seen near Cardiff, when traced westwards,
pass into a littoral facies of massive limestones and conglomerates. In the present
communication an account of the normal Liassic rocks of the Cardiff district is given,
as this will form a basis for the correlation of the modified deposits further west. The
lecture was illustrated by lantern-slides and specimens.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE MODERN HUMANITIES RESEARCH ASSOCIATION</h3>

<p>The January number of the <i>Bulletin</i> of the Modern Humanities Research Association
contains a summary of the Presidential Address delivered in October, 1919, by
M. Gustave Lanson, the famous French scholar and critic. The Association, which,
though founded only in June, 1918, numbers nearly 500 members, is now penetrating
to some of the remoter quarters of the globe; among the last candidates to be elected
were some from Czecho-Slovakia, the Malay States, New Zealand, and Western Canada,
and most of these were at once put into touch with members at home belonging to
subject groups representing their particular interests. The Hon. Secretary (Mr. E.
Allison Peers, 24 Beaufort Road, Kingston-on-Thames) writes in the <i>Bulletin</i> of
proposals submitted to the Association that it should produce a comprehensive Bibliographical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span>
Annual, a task which a body with so wide a membership seems peculiarly
fitted to attempt.</p>

<p>The Modern Humanities Research Association is fulfilling another obligation which
rests upon all who speak the English language in its efforts to bridge the Atlantic and
unite those on both sides who are engaged in higher studies in Modern Languages and
Literatures. Its membership is growing in the United States so rapidly that an American
Secretary (Professor M. Blakemore Evans, of the Ohio State University) has been
appointed. At its most recent London meeting, on January 6th, too, Professor Carleton
Brown, of Minnesota, was among the speakers on "Conditions of Postgraduate
Study." Such interchange of help and information as the Association brings about
between England and America can have none but good effects.</p>

<p>Among the Vice-Presidents of the Association, prominent names are those of Sir
Sidney Lee (its first President), Dr. Walter Leaf, Sir A. W. Ward, M. Jusserand, Signor
Farinelli, Professor Jespersen, Professor Oliver Emerson, and Sr. Menéndez Pidal.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE ROYAL NUMISMATIC SOCIETY</h3>

<p>At the January meeting of the Royal Numismatic Society the Rev. E. A. Sydenham
read a paper on the "Coinages of Augustus." He began by giving a chronological
summary of the various series and groups of coins under Augustus. There were seven
species of mints: (<i>a</i>) the Senatorial Mint of Rome; (<i>b</i>) Military Mints; (<i>c</i>) Mints in
Senatorial Provinces; (<i>d</i>) Mints in Imperial Provinces; (<i>e</i>) Autonomous Mints
(issuing bronze only); (<i>f</i>) the "Imperatorial Mint"; (<i>g</i>) the Imperial Mint. After
brief notes on the Senatorial Mint (43-36 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), the military coinage of Octavius in Gaul
and Italy (41-39 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), incidentally attributing the S.C. coins to camp mints of Northern
Italy, Mr. Sydenham proceeded to discuss the Asiatic coinages (28-15 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) and the
Imperatorial Mint (21-15 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>). Besides coins generally attributed to Asiatic mints
the reader proposed to give the undated silver and gold with CAESAR DIVI F to Asia
rather than Rome, and criticised Laffranchi's attribution of certain coins to Phrygia
and Gabrici's to Athens. The CA bronze coins he attributed to Asia reading the CA
as <i>Commune Asiæ</i>. The coins attributed to the "Imperatorial" Mint are very distinctive
in style and were probably issued under direct control of Augustus. These coins had
been attributed by Grueber to Rome and by Laffranchi to Spain. Mr. Sydenham gave
cogent arguments against these views and added reasons for considering them a distinct
Imperatorial issue. A theory on which a good deal of the argument turns is that in
28 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Augustus made a formal surrender of his triumviral office and the extraordinary
powers pertaining to it. Included in the powers was probably the right of coinage. The
surrender of this right was merely an act of policy which Augustus did not regard as
permanently binding. But he held to it to this extent that for five or six years he issued
no coins of any sort on his own authority, and even down to the end of his reign he
issued no coins in Rome. After an experimental coinage through P. Carisius in Spain
(24-22 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) he inaugurated his "Imperatorial" Mint, but confined its operations to
the provinces. Finally he fixed the Imperial Mint at Lugdunum (14 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>).</p>

<h3>POETRY</h3>

<h4 class="left">MANSOUL, OR THE RIDDLE OF THE WORLD. By <span class="smcap">Charles M. Doughty</span>.
Selwyn &amp; Blount. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>We imagine that there is no difference of opinion, amongst those who have read it,
about Mr. Doughty's prose book, now a generation old, <i>Wanderings in Arabia Deserta</i>.
It was one of the great prose works of the nineteenth century, a book which (the
geographers assure us) was astonishingly accurate as a record of exploration, and which
repeatedly soared into passages of description and meditation unsurpassed for muscularity
and grandeur. Even that book, however, was the work of a man odd in temperament
and outlook and possessing peculiar ideas as to the use of the English language.
In the volumes of poetry which he has been producing so rapidly in his old age his
eccentricities have been projected very much farther. We should not be surprised to
hear that he had never read (barring perhaps Shakespeare and Milton) any poet later
than Spenser; we are certain that he habitually reads no one later than Spenser, and
the poet with whom a comparison most frequently leaps to the mind is someone earlier
still, namely, Langland. There are those, a very few, who swallow Mr. Doughty whole,
who enjoy his archaisms, real and "pseudo," who think <i>The Dawn in Britain</i> the
greatest poetical work of our time, and will hear nothing against even the topical
passages of his poem about the German war. There are more who find him frankly
unreadable in bulk, but are willing to turn over his pages for the sake of the occasionally
lovely passages of description that they find on them; whilst the average intelligent
reader would probably run from any page of any of his poetical works, so stony is the
way that the disciple must tread and so vigorous the discipline to which he must
subject himself.</p>

<p>For ourselves, we read Mr. Doughty through as in duty bound, and we perceive
even in his knottiest and even in his naïvest passages the workings of a powerful and
original mind, the observations of an eye which looks at history and the material world
as though they had never been looked at before, the strivings of a heart that has always
been acutely aware of the world behind the seen. Nevertheless, not even this compensates
us fully for a cumbrousness of style, a malformation of shape, and a guttural
obscurity of speech hard to equal in all the annals of literature; and we are, we fear,
to be most sympathetic to that second class of readers who look to Mr. Doughty only for
occasional flowers and remember, out of all they have read of his, only stray images,
as of a shepherd on a hill or swallows circling over the fresh meadows in the dawn of
the world. <i>Mansoul</i> is all of a piece with the others; we almost think that in a few months
it will, in our own memories, have amalgamated with the others. It opens in the familiar
mode, the "grand manner," but just a little awry:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As chanced I sate on terrace of an house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In summer season, after sickness past;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fell, surprised my sense, into deep trance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein meseemed, much musing in my thought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cogitations heard, of many hearts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came and went, in <span class="smcap">Mantown's</span> market-place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereon I looked. And in my spirit I asked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What were indeed right paths of a man's feet;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lacking light, wont stumble in world's murk.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">There can be heard the grave voice, there seen the something like majesty of port, there
noticed a little of Mr. Doughty's obscurity and some of his, we daresay even unconscious,
fads such as the avoidance of particles and the refusal to use the apostrophe 's.
Thus it continues for two hundred pages of contortion and clouds with flashes of
sunshine coming through them. At one moment we are wondering why on earth Mr.
Doughty should call Tigris and Euphrates "Digla" and "Frat" if he has to translate
these terms in a footnote; at another we are giving up an unusually dark passage in
despair; at another we are wondering whether perhaps his best things do not actually
gain something from the mannerisms that normally make our heads ache. The
narrative is very hard to follow. The singer, accompanied by Mansoul and one Minimus,
peregrinates through the under world, surveys past civilisations, and converses with
(amongst others) Nebo, Zoroaster, Socrates, and St. Stephen. The Kaiser (we
conceive) is, in anticipation, interviewed:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One crowned, cast lately down unto this place<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">a Warmonger and a coxcomb whose "werewolfs face" is now blotted by "a loathly
leprosy"; and there is a pagan to the soul of all things at the end, the Muse of Britain
and Colin (presumed Spenser) being intermittently in mind throughout. Yet at any
time Mr. Doughty is liable to break, without the least awareness of writing a purple
patch, into a packed passage full of feeling and sweet to the memory. Take one such:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I stayed, where pleasant grassy holms depart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those streaming waters, bordered all along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With daphne and willow herb, sweep sedge, laughing robin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With woodbind garlanded and sweet eglantine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And azure-hewed in creeky shallows still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget-me-nots lift our frail thoughts to heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broods o'er those thymy eyots drowsy hum;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bourdon of glistering bees, in mails of gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Labouring from sweet to sweet, in the long hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sunny heat; they sound their shrill small clarions.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hurl by booming doors, gross bee-fly kin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Broadgirded, diverse hewed, in their long pelts;)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That solitary, whiles there light endureth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In summer skies, each becking clover-tuft haunt.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">We do not think that Mr. Doughty should be ignored by anyone who wishes to be
familiar with all the good work done in poetry in our time. But, in recommending him,
we warn readers that they should approach him almost as they would approach <i>Piers
Plowman</i> itself; Chaucer is distinctly more easy and modern.</p>

<h4 class="left">IMAGES OF WAR. By <span class="smcap">Richard Aldington</span>. Allen &amp; Unwin. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<h4 class="p0 left">WORMS AND EPITAPHS. By <span class="smcap">H. W. Garrod</span>. Blackwell. 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The first of these small books seems to have been written on active service, the
second on return to Oxford after active service. That Mr. Richard Aldington's
verse should have a larger content than before is natural; his pre-war verse, to the non-Imagist
eye, consisted largely of sweet nothings starred with Greek names. We have here
emotional experiences of a less tenuous kind; the poet is coming nearer a comprehension
of Keats' remark that poets should express what all men feel. This in <i>Trench
Idyll</i>, <i>Time's Changes</i>, <i>Reverie</i>, and other poems he does; and sometimes he conveys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">595</a></span>
the emotion through the medium of a careful picture, as clear in its way as one of
Mr. Kennington's drawings. Here is <i>Picket</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Dusk and deep silence ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three soldiers huddled on a bench<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over a red-hot brazier,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a fourth who stands apart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watching the cold rainy dawn.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then the familiar sound of birds&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clear cock-crow, caw of rooks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frail pipe of linnet, the "ting! ting!" of chaffinches,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over all the lark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outpiercing even the robin....<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wearily the sentry moves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muttering the one word: "Peace."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Here there is more of a rhythm than usual. But the defect of Mr. Aldington and his
Imagist friends is that, although they are quite right, though not original, in emphasising
the need for concrete language, they do for the most part lack that rhythm that makes
poetry what it is and rememberable. It is not that they write in free verse. Rhyme is
no necessary part of verse, and nobody in the world ever contended that all the lines
of a poem should be of standard lengths. But a poem in free verse&mdash;it is this which
chiefly distinguishes Whitman's good from his bad poems&mdash;should have a continuous
rhythm other than that of prose, and <i>will</i> have it if it is written by a man who is
strongly moved and has the gift of musical expression. Mr. Aldington may have that
gift, but if so he represses it.</p>

<p>Mr. Garrod's volume bears a picture of a graveyard: therein the tombstones of
Messrs. Lloyd George and Balfour, Lords Haldane, Northcliffe and Birkenhead, and Sir
Edward Carson. This looks sweeping, but on reference to his epigrammatic epitaphs,
one finds that he admires the Old "Gang" and deplores the New. His verses are
neat but slight. The best are those on Rupert Brooke, on the new invaders of Oxford
who vainly attempt to emulate the dead, and on Reconstruction:</p>

<h4 class="left">SELECTED POEMS. By <span class="smcap">Lady Margaret Sackville</span>. Constable. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<h4 class="p0 left">VERSES. By <span class="smcap">Viola Meynell</span>. Secker. 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, in a lively introduction to the first of these volumes&mdash;in the course
of which he suggests, provocatively, that blank verse is merely "a dignified kind of
prose, pompous in recitation and for common reading dull"&mdash;says that "Lady
Margaret Sackville is the best, in my opinion, of our English poetesses, at least of the
younger generation." It is a good thing that he added the qualification, for, apart from
the fact that Mrs. Woods has written poems better than anything that Lady Margaret
has yet done, there is Mrs. Meynell, whose too exiguous volume of verse competes for
quality with the best work of her generation. If there are scarcely any more exceptions
to make we feel that the deduction is that women are at present doing very little in
poetry, though there are vast numbers of them who write it. In the Victorian age when
Christina Rossetti and Mrs. Browning, both of whom did immortal work, were writing
together there was a general impression that these were the first fruits of women's
emancipation and that future ages would see women becoming more and more
prominent in poetry. But the wind bloweth where it listeth, and the fact that, at a time
when an unusually large number of young men are writing sincerely and strongly, not
one young poetess should have won prominence has now led to a general opinion that the
peculiar qualities of passion and thought that make poets are, and will always be,
more normal in men than in women. Lady Margaret Sackville has a reasonable technical
equipment: a fair vocabulary, facility with metre. She never says quite stupid things,
she sometimes says pretty things, and at times (as in her war poems) she reveals a certain
depth of feeling. But usually she is first and foremost derivative; sometimes from
Swinburne direct, more often generally derivative. You feel that she is giving a thin
version of something else, even when you cannot say exactly what; and her poems,
whether dramatic poems about Dionysus and Pan, or dreams, streams, Springs and
things, are just saved from being ordinary verse by the fact that she has a brain and a
heart which infuse the bare minimum of reality into them. The only things to be said
in her favour is that she is young and that her latest verses are her best.</p>

<p>Something of what we lack in Lady Margaret is present, if intermittently, in the
small, charmingly-produced book by Miss Viola Meynell. Her work is uneven, and
her handling sometimes awkward, but she has, sometimes, force; she sees vividly,
thinks strongly, feels strongly, imagines strongly. The point of view of the whale that
swallowed strongly was a remarkable thing to try to adopt, but her poem on this subject,
despite a weak ending, contains verses with more bite in them than any in Lady
Margaret's book; if she has read Donne she has not read him to her hurt. <i>The Maid
in the Rice Fields</i> is charming, and <i>Poppy-seeds sent from the East</i> is more than that:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Travelled here in winter sleep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young wild Eastern poppies keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their eyelids closed. They nothing know<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is this land they lie in now.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The opening is delightful, and the theme is developed with craft and passion.</p>

<h4 class="left">DUCKS AND OTHER VERSES. By <span class="smcap">F. W. Harvey</span>. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson. 3<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Harvey's first book, <i>A Gloucestershire Lad</i>, appeared when he was in France; his
second when he was a prisoner in Germany; this is his third. The sequence has been
too rapid to show much development; both his merits and his faults are what they
were. He is only occasionally a good workman, and he has not yet succeeded in getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
himself naturally and forcibly into his work. This is explicable. He loves his country;
he wants to celebrate the old traditional simplicities of a healthy country life and (as
propagandist) to restore what we have lost of them; he stands, he says, for Romance,
Laughter, and the capacity for innocent Wonder. There is no pretence about this, but when
a man feels that he must defend the natural there is comprehensibly an air of awkwardness
and self-consciousness about him. The drinking-songs (Mr. Harvey also praises
ale) of modern singers are examples: the roysterers always have an eye on the neighbouring
teetotaller who they know is watching them and whose opposed philosophy
they wish to unseat in the affections of their fellows. Mr. Harvey is best when he is
forgetting the general principles for which he stands and simply enjoying himself;
and the superiority of his more whimsical verses suggests that his bent, like that of Mr.
Graves (with whom he has much else in common), lies more in that direction than
towards large utterance or solemnity. The title of his book suggests that he realises
this: the poem from which it is taken is certainly his most successful. It is really a close
study of ducks made with infinite relish of their quaintness:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">From troubles of the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I turn to ducks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beautiful comical things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleeping or curled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their heads beneath white wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By water cool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or finding curious things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To eat in various mucks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the pool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tail uppermost, or waddling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sailor-like on the shores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ponds, or paddling.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">He sketches the main outlines of a duck's varied life by barn, stable, and stack:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They wander at their will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you go too near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They look at you through black<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Small topaz-tinted eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wish you ill.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">On the whole, he thinks the duck was the best of God's jokes:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And he's probably laughing still at the sound that came out of his bill.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Of the more serious poems some are a trifle stale; the glorification of one's county, with
place-names rhymed, might be given a rest. <i>Requiescat</i> is a moving poem, and the
tenuity and familiarity of the idea does not prevent <i>Song</i> from lingering in the memory
more than anything else in the volume:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sweetness of birdsong shall fall upon my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall fall upon my heart;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The beauty that I find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But lie in a dream and open wide my heart<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And let the song of the birds sink down into my mind.<br /></span>

<p>Mr. Archibald Marshall is, we dare to say, one of the good writers most neglected by
contemporary critics. He has brought nothing new to the development of the novel. If
a general description were necessary, he might be most briefly and accurately classified as
a descendant of Anthony Trollope. But his talent in his own generation is unique; and no
person who enjoys or studies the fiction of this age can afford to neglect it. In some ways
his latest volume is the climax of his performance and displays at their height his peculiar
method and gifts. It consists of six stories. One, perhaps the least interesting, describes
how John Clinton, a prosperous city merchant in the time of the Regency, rescued the
family estates from his elder brother, the prodigal Beau Clinton. The second deals with
a scientific peer, innocent and absorbed, who very nearly married a woman scientist, of
origin much lower than his own, who was attracted to him only by his wealth and position.
The hero of the third is a speculative builder. The fifth narrates the misfortunes
of a patient and gentle clerk. The sixth is a story of old Squire Clinton's reactions to the
war and of how he was reconciled to the different reactions of those about him. The
fourth, which we have removed from its place, tells how Ann Sinclair, a day-pupil at
Miss Sutor's school, was sent to Coventry by her companions because she was unjustly
suspected of having damaged in malice Mary Polegate's illuminated chart of the kings of
Juda and Israel. This is the longest story in the book, occupying over one hundred
pages. The principal characters are all school-girls of various ages, and no extraneous
interests are introduced. It seems almost impossible with this material to hold a reader's
keen attention for twenty odd thousand words, and yet this is what Mr. Marshall has
done. All the persons are vividly alive and convincing; and there is a whole range of
them, each individualised and given a real personality. The story is an especially good
example of what Mr. Marshall can do and how he does it. His narrative is extraordinarily
quiet and unemphasised, and shows by its restraint the author's complete confidence in
the interest of his subject and in the adequacy of his method. In all these tales events
more or less moving take place or are referred to; but the teller never raises his voice
or gesticulates. He has no tricks. His characters reveal themselves in speech or action;
but if they do not he has no modern prejudices against telling the reader what are
their motives and what is going on in their minds. His explanations are so quiet
and so straightforward that they immediately carry conviction. When old Squire
Clinton was passing through Paris with his daughter to see her husband, wounded and
interned in Switzerland, he was displeased that his other daughter should take them to
lunch in a restaurant:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He would not have objected to exactly the same meal served in her apartment. He would
have eaten and drunk whatever had been set before him, and enjoyed it in spite of his always
strongly expressed preference for English food and English cooking. The wine he might have
noticed and commented on, because he knew about wines, and because you pleased your host
by approving of his taste in them. But this ordering of your meal in public, in consultation
with your guests, with a <i>maître d'hôtel</i> standing at your elbow and booking your orders, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">599</a></span>
without advice of his own, struck him as very like taking part in a mistress's consultation with
her servants&mdash;almost an indecency. The restaurant habit was, in fact, entirely unknown to
him. In his expansive youth it had been unheard of. The nearest he had ever come to it had
been in giving luncheons or dinners at one of his clubs&mdash;meals as elaborate as this and as
carefully arranged, but arranged beforehand, so that the guests should get the right flavour
of hospitality, and accept the good things set before them as they would have accepted them
at his own table. Neither Joan nor Nancy divined that half his displeasure, which he could not
hide, was at being obliged, under Inverell's hospitable pressure, to express his preference for
this or that luxury, with the price of it staring him in the face on the menu, when indulgence in
any sort of luxury was so far from his mood.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">So delicate and exact and truthful is this delineation of a small tract in the old man's
character that it would be almost possible to reconstruct the whole without any other
guide, as is done in the case of louder roaring monsters than Mr. Marshall's creations.</p>

<p>Mr. Gilbert Frankau's <i>Peter Jackson, Cigar Merchant</i>, presents a curious contrast to the
method of Mr. Marshall. Mr. Marshall's virtues are so quiet and unobtrusive that it is
possible to overlook them altogether. Mr. Frankau's defects are so vociferous that they
tend to obscure his real merits. He paints in violent colours. He paints his sentimental
passages with a yard broom. His style, as Mr. Arnold Bennett once observed of somebody
else, is such that even in Carmelite Street the sub-editors would yearn to correct it. He
has almost entirely eliminated the conjunction from his own version of the English
language: the "ands" and "buts" omitted from this book would, if they were restored,
increase its length by a hundred pages or so. Their absence gives the reader the impression
that Mr. Frankau is in an enormous hurry and is very short of breath. All these
defects are closely woven into the texture of one of the most strident novels ever written;
and it is quite impossible to escape from them. Nevertheless this tale of a business man
who became a gunner is one of the most lively and credible pictures of the war which we
have yet had. It matters little in the end that, whether he is describing the purchase of a
cigarette-factory or a love-scene or the battle of the Somme, the author scores exclusively
for brass and big drums. This method certainly eliminates the love-scene, but it is not
inappropriate to the other subjects; and in his accounts both of war and of business
Mr. Frankau produces a huge, crowded chaotic picture which stuns and bewilders the
reader, but at the same time convinces him that he is seeing at least one aspect of the
truth. Mr. Frankau's high level of verisimilitude and interest in such passages as the
description of the Battle of Loos depends to a very great extent on his peculiar power of
packing much detail into a small space; and it is to this perhaps that we owe the somewhat
regrettable lack of "the smaller parts of speech."</p>

<p>Mr. Beverley Nichols's book is another of the triumphs of precocity&mdash;a novel describing
the Public School system by a writer with very recent experience of it. And, like
other novels on this subject, it is a novel with a thesis. Mr. Nichols is far from disapproving
of the system. He sets out, on the other hand, to show that it is capable of
receiving and making comfortable the most eccentric of boys if he will only make the
least effort of adjustment to his environment that can be reasonably expected of a human
being in any circumstances. His hero, Paul Trevelyan, has in an extreme form all the
characteristics of the heroes of such books. He has been coddled, he has unusual tastes,
he cares nothing for games. But, very refreshingly, Mr. Nichols treats with a firm hand
both his characteristics and his sufferings. Paul undergoes just such discomforts as are
required to rid him of effeminacy and priggishness, and mould him into a boy capable
of taking a place in human society with satisfaction to himself and his companions.
The thesis of the book appears to be that the Public School system does not necessarily
deprive those who come under it of their individuality, does not necessarily crush or
torture those who depart from the normal, does act as a civilising agent on those who are
in need of it. As a piece of evidence, the book is interesting and useful. As a novel it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>
less remarkable than Mr. Waugh's <i>Loom of Youth</i>. That book was not only a contribution
to a dispute; it was also a work of fiction astonishingly well put together for its
author's years and experience. Its characters and many of its incidents were extremely
well observed and drawn. Mr. Nichols fails as a writer of fiction. His characters are
vague and unconvincing: they have no fundamental individuality. The construction
of his novel is extremely loose and uneven; and the passages of reflection are introduced
with a very clumsy hand. Whether he will succeed in correcting these faults it is impossible
to predict; but he clearly has gifts which ought to come to something. Precocity
in the things he lacks is not always a certain indication of success in maturity.</p>

<p>Mr. Huxley, alone among these writers, betrays traces of exotic influence. The last
story in his book, <i>The Death of Lully</i>, might have come from the <i>Contes Cruels</i>, perhaps,
in one way, has come thence. Others of the collection show less definite resemblances
to French models and are less evenly and carefully composed; but there are in most
of them traces of an alien exactitude and an alien wit. Mr. Huxley, as we know already
from his verse, can <i>write</i> brilliantly. His defect here, as there, lies in a deficiency of
feeling caused by an excess of self-consciousness. This self-consciousness does not
make him awkward or effusive. He is far too clever to betray it thus rudely. As in the
behaviour of some persons, it manifests itself in his work by an iron rigidity of attitude,
an immovable equability of tone. When he invents characters he does not so much
describe their actions or let them act as criticise them; he is led to adopt the pose of the
satirist more consistently than perhaps he intends. Reaction follows fast on action;
and the springs of his writing are laid bare in an extraordinarily ingenious dialogue,
called <i>Happy Families</i>, where he exposes the triple personalities, inciting, betraying,
checking one another, of a young man and a young woman sitting out together at a
dance. This piece, which seems to have unnecessarily puzzled a number of Mr. Huxley's
critics, means nothing if it does not express his opinion that in every human being
there is a stratum of the animal which is to be distrusted and restrained. But, here and
elsewhere, one wonders whether his watchfulness over this stratum has not led him
into exaggerating its extent and distrusting things which, to a less suspicious eye, do
not look in the least like it. And in another story, so fast are his reactions, we find him
mocking the shuddering and ascetic revulsion from the purely animal in man. This is
the behaviour not merely of the critic dominant over the artist, but of the critic who
leads towards Nihilism by discrediting all human impulses, instead of arranging them
in order. Mr. Huxley has, however, too much of the poet for this to be fundamental in
him, too much appreciation of bright and vivid things and bright and vivid phrases.
And it would be gravely unjust to convey the impression that it spoils his book. <i>The
Farcical History of Richard Greenow</i> is an admirable invention, full of possibilities for
bitter comedy, most, if not all, of which have been worked out; <i>Cynthia</i> is a good joke,
though its title betrays the climax a little too early; and <i>The Bookshop</i> is more human
in feeling than its companions. But the important point to notice is that, whatever may
be the perversities or the affectations of his thought, Mr. Huxley always writes well,
with a style that is never shabby or shoddy, never flamboyant or flat.</p>

<p>Mr. Bayfield's <i>Measures of the Poets</i> is meant to be revolutionary. He finds existing
systems of prosody neither complete nor sound, and would sweep them away in order
to install his own trochaic scheme. Practically every work of a predecessor is ignored,
and the author himself regrets that Lanier's <i>Science of English Verse</i>, published forty
years ago, did not come to his notice until the present book was written. He does not
mention Professor Saintsbury's <i>History</i> or <i>Manual of English Prosody</i>, nor (among
other writings, by recent or living metrists) the essays of Patmore and Mr. Robert
Bridges. A great deal of contention is thus avoided, but the probabilities of conversion
are also reduced. He asserts that the normal foot of English verse is trochaic, and that
the iambus cannot form a metrical foot, because the stressed syllable does not come
first; while Professor Saintsbury declares that the iambic is the staple foot of English
verse and is common to almost all prosodies.</p>

<p>How, then, let us ask the challenger, is the application of the trochaic system justified?
In Mr. Bayfield's scheme the plain norm of the "full blank" verse line is an eleven-syllable
arrangement of which the first is a "short," followed by five trochees; and
the following line (quoted in his second book, which takes up the subject anew) is given
as specimen:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I ⁝ come to | bury | Cæsar, | not to | praise him.‖<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">But the full line does not happen to be the common form, owing to its feminine
ending, and so he admits that the prevailing type is the "checked" form:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To ⁝ sleep; per | chance to | dream: ay | there's the | rub.∧‖<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The anacrusis or up-beat, marked off by ⁝, is an integral part of the new system;
in reality it is the device by which the author changes iambic to trochaic movement.
Here, indeed, is the crucial point of the dispute between iambic and trochaic. Under
the first, this up-beat or take-off is neither very frequent nor very rare; under the second,
it is common. Mr. Bayfield's idiosyncratic use of it is illustrated by himself thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My ⁝ heart | aches, and a | drowsy numbness pains,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">and&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Or emptied some dull | opiate | to the drains,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">and <span class="locked">by&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But ⁝ being too | happy in thine happiness;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">the reader being left to discover for himself the reason for the difference of prosodic
interpretation. If the ear should be satisfied with this difference (and Mr. Bayfield
admits that the ear is judge and jury), what might its verdict be as to the validity of a
double up-beat, leaving only semi-syllables for the rest of the line?</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And thy ⁝ mouth | shúddering | like a | shót | bírd.‖<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Here let it be remarked that his system acknowledges monosyllabic feet, but he is not
well informed in denying them a place in the iambic system. He complains of "ragtime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
scansions," in referring to the fact that the iambic system admits trochees whenever
it would break down by refusing them, and seems to deplore a resulting loss
of "continuity of rhythm." Yet he himself does not scruple to write of one of his
own illustrations: "A striking contrast in <i>rhythm</i> may be noted here. That of the
first line and a half ... is markedly trochaic; the other line and a half fall into an
equally marked iambic rhythm." He has not, in fact, escaped from the difficulties and
inconsistencies which beset the prosodist. He does little more than prove that the music
of the poets cannot be defeated or disguised by either system. He gives this as containing
a quinquesyllabic foot:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, ∧ | Juliet, I will | lie with thee to-night,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">and dubiously suggests "hire" as a disyllable in:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And ⁝ hire | post-horses; | I will hence to-night.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">He is aware that an alternative scansion may in some cases be correct, but does not
sufficiently realise that any prosodic system is but an artificiality, formed to explain,
and not dictate, the infinitely variable rhythms of poetry. His own particular system,
for all its ingenuities, appears more artificial and arbitrary than the iambic. It is interesting
to note that his examples are largely drawn from Shakespeare, Tennyson, Swinburne,
and Shelley, all fruitful ground; while Milton and Coleridge, Campion and
Keats are much less used or left alone altogether. Might not these fascinating and
delusive excursions into the mysteries of rhythm be extended to certain living poets&mdash;at
least to Mr. Hardy and Mr. Bridges?</p>

<p><i>Shakespeare's Versification</i> is a larger book, in which Mr. Bayfield inquires into the
validity of the early texts. His purpose is:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>First to give an intelligible and consistent account of the structure and characteristic
features of his dramatic verse, the essential principles of which appear to have been wholly
misconceived hitherto, and secondly to show that there are many thousands of lines of it
that are given in modern texts not as their author intended them to be delivered, but clipped
and trimmed to a featureless uniformity that he would have abhorred.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">He finds in <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i> the ideal of verse at which Shakespeare was always
aiming, and denounces the depravity of the text as it stands&mdash;in this as in many other
of the plays. The book has a cumulative, even a dramatic interest, for setting out to
prove one thing, Mr. Bayfield frankly ends by proving another. With immense care
and patience he has examined and compared Quartos and First Folio, and noted quite
innumerable places at which the contraction and condensation of words and lines have
distorted or ruined the rhythm; and he contends that if the verse is to be presented
as the author meant it to be delivered, these must be expanded into their full forms.
He begins by considering Shakespeare's use of the "resolved" foot&mdash;that is, a foot of
more than two syllables&mdash;and discovers a constant tendency to reduce these "resolutions"
by abbreviation; the result being, for example, that violent becomes vi'lent,
desolate des'late, Demetrius Demetr'us, etc. He contends that from the outset Shakespeare
employed resolved rhythms more freely than his contemporaries, and gradually
increased the proportion with his later plays; and it is, of course, perfectly true that
the growing liberation of style which in Shakespeare expresses a psychological development,
is equally noticeable in later poets.</p>

<p>Now in comparing the Quartos with the First Folio Mr. Bayfield finds that of all
the differences the most conspicuous is the elimination of resolutions, the tendency
shown by the Quartos in this direction being aggravated in the Folio. The position is
made clear in a Table relating to fourteen Quarto plays, which shows, <i>e.g.</i>, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a></span>
<i>Othello</i> the Folio eliminates eighty-six resolutions found in the Quarto, and the latter
eliminates fourteen which the Folio displays; while a third figure, 84, "<i>enumerates cases
where, guided by the whole investigations and the revelations afforded by the first two
columns</i> [figures], I believe that a resolution should be restored." His deduction is that
the Folio is a metrical reactionary; if it is unsound to prefer its revision to the Quartos,
it is equally unsound to rely upon the Folio for the plays not included in the Quartos.
He strengthens his argument by showing that the prose (of <i>Julius Cæsar</i>, for instance),
which has no metrical obligations, is far more immune from illicit contractions, although
prose, being nearer to ordinary speech, might be expected to show very free colloquial
abbreviations. We are not prepared to follow Mr. Bayfield blindly; his trochaic
passions, hitched to his resolution to "resolve," do not compel unquestioning obedience;
we are not convinced by a line like, "From ⁝ Syria to Lydia and to Ionia," when the
received text reads:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i7">From Syria<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Lydia and to Ionia, whilst&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">and his resort to "Cross Accent" for the scansion of such lines as</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">is yet farther from persuading us, and seems, like so many of his arguments and instances,
to be the mere expression of his hatred of the iambic. Nevertheless, his abundant
recital of divergencies from the Quartos' resolved lines&mdash;to consider only that which
is a matter of simple enumeration&mdash;can be taken quite apart from the soundness or
unsoundness of his metrical prepossessions; and what we have called the cumulative
interest of this treatise is most plainly felt in the development of this theme as play
after play is examined.</p>

<p>It is in the chapter called "Conclusions" that the interest suddenly becomes dramatic.
Mr. Bayfield has been arguing that Shakespeare is not printed as he should be printed&mdash;that
is, with "the clear and uncramped enunciation of trisyllabic and quadrisyllabic
feet"&mdash;and that the mangling of these was done for and by the players in order to reduce
the verse to the common disyllabic type which alone they could comfortably manage.
But now he derives a "flood of light" from the 1616 Jonson folio, the proofs of which
are presumed to have been corrected by Jonson himself. From the printing of <i>Sejanus</i>
he finds that Jonson's resolutions are abridged even where the line makes their full
enunciation essential to the rhythm. Space will not permit the tracing of the new
argument here, but Mr. Bayfield at length concludes that what he has supposed in the
first three hundred pages of his book to be attributable to the perversities of the Press,
are after all merely recognised contractions which were never meant to suggest the
clipped pronunciations given to them. His charge, in fact, is no longer levelled against
the early texts from which his affluence of instances is drawn, but against the interpretation
of them; the very apostrophe (with division) being in reality but a signal calling
attention to the resolution which generations of editors, readers, and players have
supposed it was meant to abolish. The dramatic interest is complete.</p>

<p>Mr. Bayfield claims for his books the authority justly due from forty-five years'
application of prosodic principles to English verse. We can but conclude with wishing
<i>Shakespeare's Versification</i> a fuller index and a wide study, and suggest to the author
that those who are concerned with verse as writers and not as teachers have not always
failed to give the full syllabic value to the common abbreviations of the text.</p>

<p>Miss Ford's book is a "practical" treatise and might have been a valuable one. The
first sentence tells us that many of her examples of verse-forms are from her own pen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">604</a></span>
while Mr. Bayfield has at any rate been content with Shakespeare. Why should she
write four stanzas in imitation of <i>Love in the Valley</i>? She thinks it too well known to
make quotation advisable, yet gives us the commonest things of Wordsworth and
Shelley and Coleridge. She misprints Shakespeare and Wordsworth shamefully,
thinks that Professor Saintsbury is dead, and, sparing only four pages for "the lyric,"
devotes twenty-seven to such forms as roundel, ballade, etc. Her book, we think,
has been spoiled by haste; yet she has such enthusiasm and brightness as tempt us
to regret that haste and to hope for better work.</p>

<h4 class="left">ROUSSEAU AND ROMANTICISM. By <span class="smcap">Irving Babbitt</span>. Houghton Mifflin
Company. 17<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Metaphysicians have been forced by the impossibility of obtaining from observed
nature either confirmation or disproof of their theories to develop a technique the
principal aim of which is coherence. So admirable indeed has this technique become in
its logic and complexity that it has been adopted by many workers in other fields, on
the whole with disastrous results. In this book Professor Babbitt applies it to literature,
although he appears quite able to follow more empirical methods. His reading has been
extensive, and his judgments are precise. Unfortunately he is not much interested in
or amused by books save as the symptoms of moral and metaphysical observations.
He eats nothing out of them. He only covers them with his cobwebs.</p>

<p>Like most metaphysicians, Professor Babbitt thinks in twos. The trick is familiar.
Define A. Call not-A B. One is very bad, one very good, and the history of life, or of
whatever else is under discussion, is the history of their conflict. For this professor, A
is an emotional and naturalistic romanticism, and is very bad indeed. Rousseau is its high
prophet, the great war its issue, and "smart young radicals" its dupes. We are invited
back to ancient Greece, where A is absent, and B, that is to say classicism, has neither
artifice nor formality, back to Socrates, back to Aristotle, back apparently to anyone
who is a philosopher and not a poet.</p>

<p>Now there is an essential fallacy in grouping writers like politicians, in ringing a
division bell for ever in their ears and furthermore doing their voting for them. This
talk of schools and of influences and of disciples is extremely prevalent among the
academic critics in America. It may safely be said that they have illuminated nothing
thereby. Writers may use the language of their times and their friends, but it is as a
vestment and not as a foundation. Of course, the romantic revolution, like the spluttering
rebellions of our own day, may have induced some subordinates to produce manifestos
and call them works of art. Some young men may be so excited by the eccentricity of
their form as to forget the necessity of any content. But such works do not usually
occupy the critic for long, and valuable appreciation of literature will not be content
with a quasi-botanical classification.</p>

<p>What are we to do, for example, with Charles Lamb? Is he a classicist or a romanticist?
Professor Babbitt has no qualms in affixing the latter label. Lamb is as romantic as
Wordsworth is, he says, but about towns instead of about the country, and as a proof
he refers the reader to a letter in which Lamb, writing to Wordsworth, says: "In
London I have formed as many and intense local attachments as any of you mountaineers
can have done with dead nature. The lighted shops of the Strand ... the old
bookstalls, parsons cheapening books, coffee houses, steams of soup from kitchens,
the pantomimes," and so on. Little can be gained for the appreciation of Elia or of the
"Lake School" by saying classic or romantic about this, and if this is indeed a child
of Rousseau, we may be certain that he would have dropped it with the rest at the
door of the foundling hospital.</p>

<p>Probably, however, the professor does not want to foster appreciation. His incursion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">605</a></span>
into literature is a border foray, and he is off at once with his plunder to his ethical
highlands. We remain to count our losses. Milton, who "on the whole is highly serious,"
is not much injured. But Keats is unwise. Browning is only half-educated. Wordsworth,
until he began the <i>Ecclesiastical Sonnets</i>, was betrayed by his "penchant for paradox."
Shelley was an emotional sophist, with a nympholeptic imagination, who fell into sheer
unreality. These judgments contain truth, but a very little of truth. To write thus is too
plainly to adopt the methods of a political opponent. Professor Babbitt warns us that
if he had attempted rounded estimates these would have been more favourable, but
that as it is he is severe because he is laying down principles, principles of discipline
and authority as against the unrestrained individualism of the modern.</p>

<p>One wonders, too, whether this massive series&mdash;the present volume is the fourth&mdash;will
contribute much more to ethics than to literature; whether an intensive study
of the West European literature of 1790 to 1850 will indeed, as Professor Babbitt may
expect, dissuade readers from surrendering to the emotions; whether the indecorum
of Rousseau does threaten civilisation with breakdown; and whether the imitation of
Sophocles and Dante would morally improve the character.</p>

<p>It is, in short, not very obvious why this book was written, nor who will take pleasure
in reading it, except for the enjoyment of a first-class mind, even when it works in a
vacuum.</p>

<h4 class="left">SPRINGTIME AND OTHER ESSAYS. By Sir <span class="smcap">Francis Darwin</span>. Murray.
7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This is an amiable book of gossipy essays, mostly in the key popular at University
Extension meetings. Some of them are reviews and rely a little too much on extracts
for any one familiar with the books noticed to derive much excitement from them.
The title-essay, however, together with that on a <i>Procession of Flowers</i>, and the paper
entitled <i>Recollections</i> are both worth attention. The essay on his boyhood and youth
shows that Sir Francis has an eye for character, and no little gift for expressing himself
neatly about his friends and acquaintances. Here is an admirable vignette of Parslow,
the butler:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He had what may be called a baronial nature: he idealised everything about our modest
household, and would draw a glass of beer for a postman with the air of a seneschal
bestowing a cup of malvoisie on a troubadour. He would not, I think, have disgraced
Charles Lamb's friend Captain Burney, who welcomed his guests in the grand manner
to the simplest of feasts. It was good to see him on Christmas Day; with how great an
air would he enter the breakfast-room and address us: "Ladies and gentlemen, I wish
you a happy Christmas," etc. I am afraid he got but a sheepish response from us.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It has something of the air of those charming pictures of Christmas in the country which
Randolph Caldecott used to contribute to the <i>Graphic</i> Special Numbers. Sir Francis's
paper on <i>Names of Characters in Fiction</i> does not seem to us an adequate treatment of
a really fascinating subject. He just touches the fringe of it, but he appears to us over-lenient
to the bad old habit of naming characters after their vices, virtues, or idiosyncrasies.
That is tolerable in purely allegorical work, such as Bunyan's, but becomes
very tiresome in Thackeray&mdash;whom Sir Francis rates far too highly&mdash;and frequently
absurd both in him and minor authors. Women novelists have here shown more sense;
you do not meet such terrible monstrosities as Mantrap, Lollypop, Fitzoof, Portansherry,
or Nockemorf in the novels of Jane Austen, Charlotte Brontë, or Mrs. Gaskell.
A character's name is not perfect if one can imagine it different, and most of the
"typical" names are mere labels which have no real, organic connection with their
wearers, as have the names of Flaubert's characters, of Balzac's, or of Henry James's.</p>

<h4 class="left">DICKENS, READE, AND COLLINS, SENSATION NOVELISTS: A
STUDY IN THE CONDITION AND THEORIES OF NOVEL WRITING
IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND. By <span class="smcap">Walter C. Phillips</span>, Ph.D. New York:
Columbia University Press. 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Phillips is rather a pathologist of fiction than a critic. His thesis here, broadly speaking,
is that Dickens, and after him Wilkie Collins and Charles Reade, were drawn into
melodramatic invention by the demands of the public and the conditions of publication
of their day. His diagnosis is indisputable, though his premises are not. It is not
to be denied that Dickens wrote melodrama. He liked that kind of thing, and so did
his public. Where Mr. Phillips goes astray is in assuming that Dickens was a tradesman
who supplied a craving public. The truth is otherwise. Dickens gained his public
with the <i>Pickwick Papers</i>, and after that could do what he pleased. It is quite another
thing to say that he was of like mind with his public, and took in melodrama through
the pores. It had been in the air for fifty years. But Mr. Phillips sees little else in Dickens,
and thereby does his subject and himself injustice. For one false note which that great
man struck, the trained ear will detect two dozen true. If some of his monsters&mdash;Quilp
in particular&mdash;are pantomime monsters, and some of his angels pantomime angels, others
of them, monstrous or not, have been added to the inhabitants of English-speaking
lands, and still walk in our midst. No writer has ever increased the population to the
same extent. Mrs. Gamp may be more than woman, or less; she may be a living proverb.
It does not matter, since she lives. Dickens, in fact, was a genius. He did what
he chose, or what he must, sometimes superlatively well, sometimes incredibly ill. We
bolt the bad for the sake of the good. There is no concealment possible of the fact that
he had unfortunate and occasionally unwholesome tastes. The worst of them was his
pleasure in cruelty. Quilp and his wife, Jonas Chuzzlewit and his, Creakle and his boys,
Squeers and his: there is a gloating over such relations which, to our mind, is the
worst blot upon Dickens's fame. But Mr. Phillips, absorbed in the commercial aspect
of literature, counting the words in the huge novels of that day, calculating circulation,
and examining into profits, has not had time for such points. He had been better employed
there than in amassing statistics for "The Novelist as Wage-earner." Too much
attention has been paid already to the finance of the business. Money-getting did not
affect Dickens in the first flights of his genius, when his direction for good and all was
determined. It may have stimulated Wilkie Collins and Charles Reade&mdash;a very different
pair of men. Mr. Phillips is in the right when he hits them off as "virtuosos." "Not
even Stevenson," he shrewdly says, "was more exclusively and hopelessly a writer
of story-books" than Charles Reade.</p>

personal records of soldiers, the third a more pretentious effort by a civilian. Colonel
Butler went out in 1914 with the Seventh Division to Belgium, was engaged in the
first battle of Ypres, came home wounded, returned to Flanders, went thence to the
Somme (in the days before the Somme became hell), and leaves us finally at Marseilles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a></span>
on his way to "some other theatre of war." The book contains nothing very remarkable,
but it is agreeably written, and should give pleasure to the author's friends and to others
who care to be reminded again of "Somewhere in France," where they have marched
and fought and billeted.</p>

<p>Mr. Bishop's is a modestly told and mildly exciting story of an escape from the Turks.
He was an Indian Army subaltern captured at Kut, and interned at Kastamuni. Thence
with two companions he got away to the Black Sea coast, was recaptured and rescued
again. The rescuers were a handful of diverting brigands, with whose help Mr. Bishop
eventually crossed the Black Sea and made his way home <i>viâ</i> Russia. There is no attempt
to generalise either about military matters or prison life. We gather, however, that Mr.
Bishop and his friends were not on the whole badly treated by the Turks. And there
was a time, in 1916, when they lived well&mdash;eggs at halfpenny a piece, good white flour
at sixpence a pound, and fruit practically gratis! O blessed Kastamuni!</p>

<p>Mr. Bodley is more sophisticated. In the first half of his book he takes us over the
battlefields of France, and discourses of the captains and the kings, the priests and
politicians of past centuries who fought and played and intrigued there, of the glories
and beauties of the old towns and villages of the Somme and the Marne, of Rheims and
Verdun and a hundred other places. But he completely changes the angle of his
attack in the second half of his volume, which he calls, "An additional chapter on
the results of the late war as affecting our national life and imperial interests." His
main theme appears to be the necessity or desirability of continuing hostility to
Germany. The Germans, he thinks, are still a fundamentally evil race whose worst
faults we imitate and whose few virtues we eschew. These virtues are their commercial
enterprise, their zest for town-planning and housing, and the comparatively small amount
of money they waste in paying lawyers. Lawyers, it appears, are Mr. Bodley's <i>bête noire</i>;
he regards them, and especially the political barristers and the overpaid judges and law
officers, as the curse of our unhappy country. But what chiefly raises his ire are the
abominations which we are said to have copied from Prussia of bureaucracy and the
system of "honours"&mdash;peerages, baronetcies, knighthoods, Orders of Merit, Orders
of the British Empire, poured out in bucketfuls on a motley crowd of corrupt or
undistinguished individuals. This is, of course, an indictment which any writer is
entitled to make, though some may think that Mr. Bodley occasionally lets himself be
carried rather far by his indignation. But the connection with the faults of Germany
seems a little far-fetched. There are times, too, in the course of his special pleading
when he verges on the ridiculous. Is it not absurd, for example, to say that "the
formidable machinery of state socialism" (meaning chiefly Old Age Pensions
and National Insurance) is "incompatible with representative government"? And
who wants a long argument to prove that Queen Victoria was not responsible for the
plague of Germanism which Mr. Bodley thinks has infected English society? The whole
of this "additional chapter" is a melancholy illustration of the effect of the war in
causing an educated Englishman to lose his sense of proportion.</p>

<h4 class="left">RECORDS. By Admiral of the Fleet <span class="smcap">Lord Fisher</span>. Hodder &amp; Stoughton. £1 1<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The plain man who walks in the trim garden of literature must feel, in coming upon
Lord Fisher in print, as we imagine the shade of Bach might feel confronted by a
jazz band, or an elementary drawing mistress before a canvas of Mr. Wyndham Lewis.
Lord Fisher has for many months been "the talk of the town"; the respectable
reviewer feels that only in the talk of the town can the appropriate comments be found.
<i>Records</i> begins thus: "Of all the curious fables I've ever come across, I quite think
the idea that my mother was a Cingalese Princess of exalted rank is the oddest! One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span>
can't see the foundation of it!" And it ends with a letter from a fellow-Admiral suggesting
that Lord Fisher, like Jesus Christ, is an Enigma. Between those two passages there
is a roaring torrent of anecdote, of quotations and exclamation marks and capital letters,
of criticism (often highly "indiscreet"), of apologia, of confident prediction, of everything
that is diverting and irritating and arresting and astoundingly human&mdash;a torrent
that sweeps the reader off his feet and leaves him gasping and incredulous. The book
is a monument of magnificent egoism. One can only use its author's own word of
a sermon by Dean Inge and say it is "splendiferous." We are told, in parenthesis,
that he got into the Navy by writing out the Lord's Prayer, doing a Rule of Three sum,
and drinking a glass of sherry. We are told that he looks like a Christmas-tree when he
wears his decorations. We have stories of how, in his shirt-sleeves and with a boot in
each hand, he entertained King Edward VII. in his bedroom, and of a comic postcard
sent to him by Queen Alexandra. There is one chapter devoted to his views on the
Bible, and another containing a reprint of four speeches which he made: one at the
Royal Academy Banquet, a second at the Mansion House, the other two (and these
would both go on a postcard) in the House of Lords. There are numerous photographs
of him standing on his quarter-deck with Kings and Tsars, and gentlemen grotesquely
clad in top hats and frock coats; there is a long appendix containing a list of Lord
Fisher's "Great Naval Reforms." His style beggars description. He throws epithets
such as "lovely" about like a high-spirited schoolgirl. He tells us, with the candour of
a schoolboy, that Sir William Harcourt was "a genial ruffian" and Sir Michael Hicks-Beach
"a perfect beast." The whole book is ablaze with these bright flowers. And let
us not be misunderstood: we say nothing in disparagement of them. Would that more
biographies were written so!</p>

<p>But Lord Fisher, we suspect, has suffered, and will suffer, from the defects&mdash;or should
one say the excess?&mdash;of his qualities. It is harder for a camel to pass through the eye of
a needle than for an Englishman&mdash;and above all an official Englishman&mdash;to take a man
seriously who writes and talks and thinks like this. <i>Hinc illæ lacrimæ!</i> as our author
might say (for he loves his tags). And yet there is serious stuff in this book&mdash;discussions
of the conduct of the war, of naval tactics and education, of submarines and oil-engines
and guns, and "Admiralty limpets." He has quarrelled on all these matters&mdash;and on
a thousand more, no doubt&mdash;with many of his colleagues. It is not for us to take sides
in such Homeric contests. Even now he is trailing his coat again before the respectable
public with a hectic chapter entitled "Democracy." "Democracy," he says, "means
'equal opportunity for all.'" A real Democracy in England would not have permitted
secret treaties nor flouted the Russian Revolution, nor "kept true Labour leaders
waiting on the doormat." "Hereditary titles," he cries, "are ludicrously out of date
... and the sooner we sweep away all the gimcracks and gewgaws of snobbery the
better." And, in short, this old warrior of seventy-nine, a Peer of the Realm, dressed
like a Christmas-tree in his decorations, the intimate of Kings and Emperors, declares
himself a Republican, and wants to "sack the lot"! Words fail us; we can only lay
the book down and pant for the next!</p>

<h4 class="left">HENRY FOX, FIRST LORD HOLLAND, HIS FAMILY AND RELATIONS.
By the <span class="smcap">Earl of Ilchester</span>. In two volumes. Murray. 32<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The deeplier we study eighteenth-century political history the more satisfied we become
that there were but two figures in it with the gleam of statesmanship upon them, and
but one with the light of genius. Sir Robert Walpole deserves his son's boast: He did
"maintain this country in the enjoyment of the twenty happiest years that England
ever enjoyed." Writing when he did, and so far as it goes, that is true. If his methods
draw us to a cynical conclusion, the material to his hand&mdash;a German King, a discredited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_609" id="Page_609">609</a></span>
opposition, and a horde of rapacious place-hunters to keep fed&mdash;must be remembered
and allowed for. Pitt was a much more scrupulous man, and a much more gifted man,
but he was less successful for those very reasons. He had the honest man's scorn of
iniquity, and he had less hold of himself. Sir Robert could keep his temper; Pitt
never could. He knew the Duke of Newcastle to be a liar and an old fool, and as good
as told him so. "Fewer words, if you please, my lord, for your words have long lost
all weight with me." There is not much accommodation about that. Sir Robert suffered
fools gladly: he could work with them better. Pitt was fastidious, and would not soil
his fingers with the only things they wanted of him. As for all the rest they were a venal
crew, timid as rats and greedy as dogs. A month or two ago there came under review
in these pages the life of one of them, George Bubb Dodington&mdash;remarkable only
because, a thorough-paced rogue, he turned himself inside out for the admiration
of posterity. Here, at much greater length, done with conspicuous judgment and ability,
is the life, in two volumes, of another, Henry Fox, the founder of Holland House and
its line of peers.</p>

<p>If a word were needed to explain the rise of the brothers Stephen and Henry Fox,
the sons of a creature (whom Horace Walpole called "a footman") of Charles II.'s, it
would be the word which explains the whole of eighteenth-century statecraft, the
word Patronage. From the King, fountain of honours, this sacred river ran to the Peers,
disposers of places, and from them broadened out into a pool where swam the borough-mongers
and jobbers, owners of the House of Commons. As for the electorate, wherever
there was one, "the business of the people is to choose Us," said young Charles Fox,
while he was yet under the influence of his father; and although the capital letter is
ours, and not upon record, we may be sure that it was not wanting in delivery. It is
indeed but an echo of Henry Fox himself.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Our elections, thank God! do not depend upon the giddy mob. They are generally
governed by men of fortune and understanding, and of such our ministers, for this twenty
years past, have been so happy as to have a majority in their favour. Therefore, when we
talk of people with regard to elections, we ought to think only of those of the better sort,
without comprehending the mob or mere dregs of the people.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Such was the nursery-ground of the hero of Lord Ilchester's volumes, from which
that hero's son was able to lift himself.</p>

<p>By sitting still and stolidly manipulating his boroughs Stephen Fox served himself
better than his more able brother. He did not become so rich, though he never lacked.
He had money, he married money, and became an earl. He suffered none of the
mortifications and humiliations of the active politician, who made himself the most
unpopular man in England, and, after serving his King at the expense of his country,
was thrown out and thrown over. To be sure he was Paymaster for eight years, during
which time a sum of £46,000,000 passed through his hands to his immeasurable profit;
but to do justice to Fox, his riches weighed as nothing beside his sense of the ingratitude
of the Rigbys and others of the sort whom he had loved and tried to serve. Though he
did not begin so well off as his elder brother, he cannot be said to have been badly off.
At twenty-one he dropped into a sinecure office of £450 a year and a capital sum which
brought his whole income to something like £900. His first political acquaintance of
note was Lord Hervey, and his next, from whom, to his credit, he never swerved, was
Sir Robert Walpole. "Fox really loved that man," was said of him, and truly said;
and when Sir Robert fell and he was handed over to Henry Pelham he was found
faithful again. In all this he differed widely from Bubb Dodington, having a heart as
well as a stomach, and if not principles, at least passions. Dodington was merely a
merchant of himself, but Fox suffered his feelings to act and react, often to his temporal
detriment. As Lord Ilchester shows, he was not wise in his attachments, nor always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a></span>
temperate in his actions. He alienated Scottish sympathies by his vehemence after the
Porteous riot; he made an enemy of Lord Chancellor Hardwicke by his opposition
to the Clandestine Marriages Act&mdash;an opposition which may have been grounded
upon the fact that his own marriage had been of that order; he became the friend and
ally of the Duke of Cumberland, and obnoxious on that account to Leicester House
and the heir-apparent. When George III. succeeded, and Lord Bute became the all-powerful
minister, he attached himself there, just in time to lose the friendship of the
Duke and to share in the hatred and distrust which the whole nation turned upon the
administration. In these mischances his heart rather than his head played him false.
Yet, for all his pains, neither of his masters liked him. George II. owned that Fox had
never told him a lie, and added that he was the only man who had not. But he never
trusted him in spite of that. George III., having after much hesitation given him a
barony, steadily refused to advance him higher, though no man had worked harder in
his service or, it must be added, more discreditably. It was Henry Fox who set to work,
by methods which can only be called flagrant, to form a party in Parliament to be known
as "the King's friends." That he did not succeed was not his fault.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fox directly attacked two separate members of the House of Commons, and with so little
decorum on the part of either buyer or seller that a shop was publicly opened at the Pay
Office, whither members flocked, and received the wages of their venality in bank bills,
even to so low a sum as two hundred pounds for their votes on the treaty. Twenty-five
thousand pounds, as Martin, Secretary of the Treasury, afterwards owned, were issued
in one morning; and in a single fortnight a vast majority was purchased to approve the
peace.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is perhaps going far to say that nothing more disgraceful was ever done in
Parliament, but it is not too much to affirm that no greater act of treachery was ever
attempted against the theory of popular representation by a member of the supposed
popular House. But he had his barony, and received it three years later than Bubb
Dodington obtained his.</p>

<p>It is not Lord Ilchester's fault that much of the intrigue he elucidates is rueful reading.
The wonder is that he has found the spirit with which to achieve it. When one's native
country, its neighbour states and colonial dependencies, when King, Lords, Commons,
Army, Navy, and Church are all seen to have been counters in a great game of grab;
when patriotism is as much an unknown quantity as even a rudimentary civic sense,
and the only certainty is that of one's own and one's rivals' common dishonesty, it is
no wonder that the accidents of his book count for more than the substance. What we
get of Charles Fox makes amends for Henry. Everything that Lord Ilchester has to tell
us of Charles is good. We have him first as a baby. "He is weakly, but likely to live.
His skin hangs all shrivell'd about him, his eyes stare, he has a black head of hair, and
'tis incredible how like a monkey he look'd before he was dress'd." Then he is at a
preparatory school, in 1757, where it seems that Charles has more emulation than any
boy almost ever had; next at Eton, where he and his brother Stephen entertained
their father at a dinner "bespoke from the Christopher: ... boil'd mutton and broth,
three large fowls, and a leg of mutton roasted." It was at Eton in 1758, when he was
nine years old, that he thus announced his philosophy of life. The father is writing to
the mother:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That odd dog Charles said, with a smile, he wish'd his life was at an end. I asked the
reason. "Why," says he, "it is a troublesome affair, and one wishes one had this thing or
that thing, and then one is not the happier; and then one wishes for another thing, and
one's very sorry if one can't get it, and it does not make one happier if one does."</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">We can follow him to Oxford, and wish we had room for his letter to his father
explaining with elaborate pains how he came to knock the bottom out of £150, or for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">611</a></span>
another which announces the loss of eighty guineas at cards, and registers the first of
a series of vows that it shall never happen again. All this will be found in Volume II.,
together with some account of the stormy opening of his parliamentary career&mdash;at
nineteen; but there or thereabouts we regretfully leave him, the best thing by far
that Henry Fox ever made.</p>

<p>If it were asked what this man had done in his days to deserve two biographies on
the scale of Mr. Riker's and Lord Ilchester's, the answer would be long in coming.
Henry Fox was a man of good but moderate abilities, a bad speaker, a fair debater, one
of the few, at any rate, who ever stood up to William Pitt the first. He conducted his
War Secretaryship with diligence, his Paymastership with what must be called legal
honesty. He robbed his country, but no more than any other Paymaster had done.
He enriched himself by trading with the huge balances left on his hands, sometimes
lending of them to the country which found them at twenty per cent! Every Paymaster
except Pitt, who would have none of it, had done as much, and most of them did worse.
But one searches Lord Ilchester's pages in vain for anything definitely <i>done</i> by Fox,
except, to be sure, the infamous attempt to betray the constitution by making the third
estate of the realm a creature of the first. Even that he did not succeed in doing. It was
Lord North who reaped for King George what Fox had sown. And that is about all
that one can say, and very much what Lord Ilchester himself says of Henry Fox. What
should be added to that is that the book is admirable both for lucidity of style and
arrangement, for gallantry of attack, and gaiety in action.</p>

<h4 class="left">RECOLLECTIONS OF LADY GEORGIANA PEEL. Compiled by her Daughter,
<span class="smcap">Ethel Peel</span>. London: Lane. 1920. 16<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Lady Georgiana was born in 1836 and is daughter of Lord John Russell. She should
have memorable things to tell, and perhaps she has. But Providence, which has given
her length of days and illustrious descent, has not conferred the garnering eye or the
gift of tongues. It is a pity, for she has seen so much: Holland House and Pembroke
Lodge, Bowood in the days of its greatness, Sir Robert Peel and Lord Palmerston,
the Duke and Disraeli, Rogers, Tom Moore and his wife, Tennyson, Dickens, Thackeray,
the whole Victorian galaxy. She has danced with the Prince Consort, and found him
rather cross; she has heard Tom Moore sing, and seen him weep at his own music;
she has helped entertain Garibaldi, and dined with Macaulay. She was not, however,
impressed by that pundit, found his monologue a bore, and agreed with Sydney Smith
when he said, "very gravely, towards the end of dinner, 'Macaulay, when I'm dead,
you'll be sorry you never heard me talk.'" That is something; and here is another thing
equally good. When Lord John was about to take John Bright down to stay at Woburn,
"a candid friend" wrote to the Duke of Bedford, "Hope you'll count your spoons."
Here, once more, is a glimpse into the manners of that stately place, about 1840:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Many were the happy Christmases we spent at Woburn. I remember, to our huge delight,
we were allowed to help throw mutton chops out of the dining-room window for whoever
cared to pick them up. I think that custom died out. When I was a child each guest was
provided with a piece of paper in which to wrap up an eatable for people waiting outside.</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">God bless the Squire and his relations,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep us in our proper stations!<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>No doubt that was as good a way of doing it as any. But such flowers grow rarely
in Lady Georgiana's garden, which is indeed something of a <i>hortus siccus</i> where names
and dates have to stand for more than they will bear. "I remember Mr. Kingslake
coming down to Pembroke Lodge sometimes; I don't think he had then begun his
<i>History</i>. He was always very agreeable." So much for <i>Eothen</i>. "In connection with
William Warburton, I remember Mr. Matthew Arnold, for he was a great friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_612" id="Page_612">612</a></span>
my brother-in-law's, and a comrade in the inspection of schools." And so much for
him. Of Dickens we get something more. "In the evening, I remember, he was conspicuous,
owing to wearing a pink shirt front embroidered with white." Disraeli, too,
expatiated in shirts. "Though he talked incessantly, I remember best his shirt front,
which was made of white book-muslin over a very bright rose-coloured foundation,
which shone through it." The temptation to stick pins into it must have been severe.</p>

<p>With these grains the reader must be satisfied, and with such powers of evolution as
he possesses may extract, no doubt, some more. Here is one of Lady Holland, too good
to be passed over. She proposed leaving to Lord John Russell, and did in fact leave
him, an estate in Kennington&mdash;where the Oval now is. Lord John would only accept
it for life, urging the claims of the son and daughter of the house. "I hate my son; I
don't like my daughter," said the great lady, and settled it.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE HISTORY OF TRADE UNIONISM. (Revised Edition, Extended to 1920.)
By <span class="smcap">Sidney</span> and <span class="smcap">Beatrice Webb</span>. Longmans. 21<i>s.</i></h4>

<p>Twenty-five years ago Trade Unionism was vaguely apprehended in the polite world
as a growing force in industry, useful to the working-class and even legitimate if kept
within proper bounds. Wise employers recognised its value and treated with it; the
unenlightened fought against it or accepted it with a bad grace. Many even of its friends
and allies, the Socialists&mdash;and not a few of these were themselves Trade Unionists&mdash;rated
it very low, as being, in fact, a mere "palliative of the Capitalist system." To-day
it is safe to assert that there is no institution in the country which bulks larger in the
public eye than the Trade Union movement. In numbers, wealth, solidarity, and power
it has developed out of all recognition. Its leaders sit and bargain on equal terms with
Ministers of the Crown, take their places on public committees and Royal Commissions
as of right, even threaten, amid the angry protests of adversaries who were once their
masters, to destroy the foundations of the established social order. The aims and
activities of the Trade Unions vie with the "crime wave" for first place in the columns
of the newspapers; they are discussed in trains and clubs and drawing-rooms. And, in
short, the organisation, which but a few years since was regarded as a more or less private
affair of workmen and their employers, now appears as the biggest problem that the
State has to face&mdash;as something that may even, as many will have it, supersede the
State itself.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary, in these circumstances, to dilate on the importance of a new
edition, containing an account of the developments during the last thirty years, of
Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb's <i>History of Trade Unionism</i>. When the book appeared in
1894 it was welcomed not only by intelligent minds in the working-class, but by all
students of social history, abroad as well as in this country, as a remarkable piece of
work; it took its place, and has kept its place, as a classic. Yet it had a far smaller public
than it deserved; by 1911 under 10,000 copies had been sold. Of this new volume no
less than 19,000 copies in a special edition have been bought by Trade Unionists
before publication&mdash;a notable sign of the times. We have called this edition a new volume&mdash;and
that it certainly is, for not only have Mr. and Mrs. Webb revised the work throughout
and at some points slightly amplified it, but they have added three chapters, covering
actually some two hundred and fifty pages.</p>

<p>The increase of Trade Union membership has been, as everyone knows, enormous.
In 1892, after more than two centuries of growth, the number of Trade Unionists in
the United Kingdom was not much over a million and a half. At the outbreak of the war
it was under four millions; at the present moment it is above six millions&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a></span>
nearer seven than six&mdash;and includes "probably as many as 60 per cent. of all the
adult manual working wage-earners." But what is of peculiar interest to note is the
increase in certain industries and among certain sections of the community. The organisation
of "unskilled labour" has in the last few years been prodigious, and so also has
that of women of all sorts from the "braincombers in the learned professions" to
domestic servants and the chief "hands" in the sweated trades. The female membership
of Trade Unions, which in the year before the war was in round figures 361,000,
has risen now to over three-quarters of a million, and it is still rising. Very
remarkable also is the increasing organisation of the "black-coated proletariat"&mdash;civil
servants, clerks, managers, supervisors, technicians, and the rest. This, as Mr.
and Mrs. Webb rightly insist, is an important indication of the lines on which industry
is likely to be shaped in the future. But with this vast growth of numbers, and a corresponding
growth of amalgamation and federation, there has been singularly little change
in the central machinery of the movement. The weakest point, indeed, is at the top. The
Trades Union Congress, as Mr. and Mrs. Webb put it, "remains, as we have described
it in its early years, rather a parade of the Trade Union forces than a genuine Parliament
of Labour." Its executive body, the Parliamentary Committee, does not provide that
"general staff" which the movement badly needs, and Mr. and Mrs. Webb's criticism
both of this and of the whole question of what may be called the Trade Unions' "civil
service" is very much to the front.</p>

<p>The history of Trade Unionism in this century, however, is by no means exhausted
by the records of its membership and organisation. Side by side with this it has won
an enhanced status, and not the least interesting of the three new chapters is devoted
to an account of this achievement. Mr. and Mrs. Webb give us an elaborate criticism
of the famous Taff Vale judgment; they discuss the Osborne case and the Trade
Union Act of 1913, the relations of the Unions and the Government during and after
the war. And last, but not least, they describe the "revolution in thought," the influence
of Syndicalist and of Guild Socialist theories in shaping the demand for "self-government
in industry" and in determining the attitude of the workman to strikes and
Parliamentary action.</p>

<p>The final chapter deals with the political side&mdash;the rise of the Labour Party, from
its stormy birth just over twenty years ago, to the new era which opened for it at the
election of 1918. Mr. and Mrs. Webb have much friendly criticism to offer on the
subject of the present political organisation of the Labour movement. It suffers, they
observe, not merely from a lack of "Party loyalty" on the part of Trade Unionists,
but also from a confusion of central machinery. It suffers too (some say these are its
chief shortcomings) from a failure to develop a staff of trained political officers and
from a scarcity of trained Parliamentary representatives. But these weaknesses, we
suppose, are on the way to be remedied, if the Party as a whole, as well as its leaders,
is alive to them.</p>

<p>The reader is not to look in this history, as its authors remark, for any argued judgment
on the validity of Trade Union assumptions or ultimate ideals. Nevertheless, what
little they have to say on this hand is of profound interest. "The object and purpose
of the workers, organised vocationally in Trade Unions and Professional Associations,
and politically in the Labour Party," they warn us, "is no mere increase of wages or
reduction of hours. It comprises nothing less than a reconstruction of Society, by the
elimination, from the nation's industries and services, of the Capitalist profit-maker,
and the consequent shrinking up of the class of functionless persons who live merely
by owning." What form in that reconstructed Society is the organisation of
industry to take? Mr. and Mrs. Webb expect to see "the supreme authority
in each industry or service vested, not in the workers as such, but in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">614</a></span>
community as a whole.... The management of industry ... will not be the sole
sphere of either producers or consumers, but is clearly destined to be distributed
between them&mdash;the actual direction and decision being shared between the
representatives of the Trade Union or Professional Society on the one hand
and those of the community in Co-operative Society, Municipality, or National
Government on the other." They do not see eye to eye in every detail with the Guild
Socialist. But still less do they see eye to eye with that fabulous monster who stalks
through the writings and speeches both of Revolutionaries and Conservatives&mdash;the
bureaucratic Fabian Webb, harbinger of the Servile State! There may be some, we
suppose, who will find a less "detached" outlook in this volume than in the original
edition. If there is a difference of outlook, it is natural enough, for Mr. and Mrs. Webb
are more "inside" the Labour movement now than they were in 1894, and their
judgments and criticisms must inevitably show a subtle difference of tone. But this is
not to accuse them of undue partiality. No man can write an "impartial" history that
is worth reading of his own time and his own friends. And we need not regret that
Mr. and Mrs. Webb, in their detailed descriptions, for example, of the great railway
strike or the miners' dispute of last year, put the workmen's case confidently and strongly
since they see it as their own case also and that of the nation. The appearance of these
three new chapters, we do not hesitate to say, constitutes an event in the world of politics
and of letters. The <i>History of Trade Unionism</i> will remain, as it has been, a work which
every student of industry and every man of affairs must read and re-read and inwardly
digest.</p>

<h4 class="left">MY SECOND COUNTRY (FRANCE). By <span class="smcap">Robert Dell</span>. Lane. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></h4>

<p>This study of the people and institutions and spirit of France is in a class apart from
the volumes of "impressions" of foreign lands with which "week-enders" and passing
travellers are prone to favour us. "France," says Mr. Dell, "has been my home for
more than twelve years, but it was already my second country long before I went to
live there. Indeed I cannot remember a time when France had not a large place in my
affections." It is with an intimate knowledge, therefore, as well as with a profound
sympathy that he discusses the many phases of French life. But his book is by no means
a mere panegyric. He is throughout candid and critical&mdash;often bitterly critical. He
exposes ruthlessly the undemocratic character of the "Democratic Administration,"
the impotence of Parliament, the demoralising influence of small property, the evils of
the <i>petit bourgeois</i> spirit, the avarice and egotism of the <i>grande bourgeoisie</i>. How far his
view of all these things is a just one will be a matter of controversy. Some may say he
is violently prejudiced; no one, after reading this book, could deny that many of his
judgments are biased. In the final chapters there is really no pretence of impartiality;
he argues his case and "maintains his propositions," like Doctor Pancrace in the play,
<i>Pugnis et calcibus, unguibus et rostro</i>. Mr. Dell is a Socialist, but not an "Etatiste"; he
is a "libertine" and a revolutionary, with an equal dislike of bureaucracy and the
bourgeoisie. And his feelings in this matter are so strong that we may venture to doubt
his predictions as to how the Revolution will come. For the rest, Mr. Dell is a determined
Rationalist. "La France de Voltaire et de Montesquieu," he says with M. Anatole
France, "celle-là est la grande, la vraie France." For "religious" France he has no
use&mdash;neither for "irreligious" orthodoxy, nor political Catholicism, nor Modernism.
Bergsonism, too, he holds to be a baneful influence, as reactionary as the Church
which eschews it. But the old superstitions and the new philosophies, he believes, are
losing their hold; "the spirit of the true France is coming into its own again, and the
young intellect of France is returning to the rationalism of Voltaire." In all this, and
much else, he may be wrong, but he has given us a book that is at any rate profoundly
interesting.</p>

<h4 class="left">RUSSIA IN RULE AND MISRULE. By Brigadier <span class="smcap">C. R. Ballard</span>, C.B., C.M.G.,
with a Foreword by General <span class="smcap">Sir William Robertson</span>. Murray. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This is a curious and nondescript book. Beginning as a history of Russia from the
earliest times, it ends rather as the impressions of a soldier who, attached to the Eastern
front during the war, saw something of the Russian revolution. It is a soldier's book,
breezy, untrammelled by literary and historical conventions, and distinguished by a
direct simplicity which disarms criticism. The General gives an interesting account of
what happened subsequently to the revolution; but his account often gives only one
out of many views of the facts. Thus his chapter on the Kornilov incident is, as he states,
merely a summary of Kerenski's book, and cannot therefore be accepted without considerable
reserves. On pages 214-216 he gives ten outstanding facts about the Bolshevik
<i>régime</i> "which can be proved over and over again if proof be required." We should
like to see the General's proof of the first sentence in his tenth "fact," namely, that
"there are no elections of any kind...." The General has also succeeded in adding
a new complication to the already complicated problem of the spelling of Russian
names. The gentleman whose name we have seen spelt variously by other writers
Cheidze, Chheidze, and Tshcheidze appears in his book as Cheidsi.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE PEACE IN THE MAKING. By <span class="smcap">H. Wilson Harris</span>. Swarthmore Press.
6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It would be unfair to compare Mr. Harris's book with Mr. Keynes's, though it covers
something of the same ground. Mr. Keynes is analytic and, in the end, constructive,
and his subject is the rebuilding of a ruined Europe. Mr. Harris is historical and
reminiscent. Like a good journalist&mdash;and it is unnecessary to say how good a journalist
he is&mdash;he tells us how they made the peace rather than what kind of a peace they made
and should have made. It is true that in telling us the story of peace-making at Paris
he does tell us also what kind of peace they made. In fact his book has a distinct value
as a clear summary of the terms eventually hammered out by the three Great Powers
and accepted by Germany. But the angle of Mr. Harris's approach to his subject is
that of the journalistic historian. The result is a very readable and interesting book.
Putting ourselves into Mr. Harris's skilful hands, we are enabled to see, through the
various journalistic spectroscopes, something of what took place behind the shuttered
and curtained council chamber of the Big Four, which in effect was a Big Three.</p>

<h4 class="left">LEAGUES OF NATIONS. By <span class="smcap">Elizabeth York</span>. Swarthmore Press. 8<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>
net.</h4>

<p>This is a useful book for those who wish to study the long and slow development of
the idea of a League of Nations. The author begins with the idea of a League in ancient
Greece and traces it through Dante, the "Grand Design," Grotius, Penn, Saint Pierre,
Rousseau, Kant, and Bentham to Alexander I. of Russia and the Holy Alliance.
The value of the book is considerably enhanced by its careful documentation, and by
the fact that it gives us a translation of the text of many of the schemes and "covenants"
which are not easily obtainable by the ordinary reader.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE NEW OUTLOOK. By <span class="smcap">Lord Robert Cecil</span>, M.P. Allen &amp; Unwin. 1<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This brochure has a double claim to interest all who concern themselves with politics.
In the first place it is a remarkable revelation of the advancing spirit of democracy,
of the new social conscience and widening outlook of our time. For here we have a
Cecil, the type of the grand seigneurial family of high Tory traditions, calmly&mdash;or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">616</a></span>
rather enthusiastically&mdash;offering us a political programme that a few years ago would
have been greeted as wildly Jacobin. In the second place the views of Lord Robert
derive a peculiar importance from the position which he occupies to-day in the public
estimation. His high personal character, his idealism, and his ability single him out
among the members of his Party&mdash;if indeed he can be said in the present political
confusion to be of a Party. He gives us here half-a-dozen short essays dealing with the
League of Nations, the industrial problem, finance, the reform of Parliament, and the
Irish question. His practical proposals under each of these heads will not commend
themselves to everyone in all their details, but none will fail to admire the generous
and constructive spirit which underlies them. Those who are pessimistic about foreign
affairs may well wish that we had more men of this stamp to put Europe on its feet
again. Those who are exercised about the situation at home will look anxiously for the
next step of this aristocrat among the democrats.</p>

<h4 class="left">EMPIRE AND COMMERCE IN AFRICA. By <span class="smcap">L. Woolf</span>. Labour Research
Department and Allen &amp; Unwin. 20<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Woolf's object in this work is to answer the question: "What has been the result
and what the lessons of the application of the power and machinery of the European
State to Africa?" He examines very carefully and critically the history of the organisation
of the British, French, and German Colonies in North and East Africa, as well as
the Belgian Congo. The results both for Europe and for the natives he finds on the
whole to be evil. The future, if we are to continue the old policy of economic imperialism,
offers no better prospect. There is hope in the League of Nations, but for the mandatory
system, as proposed, Mr. Woolf has no enthusiasm. To make the League effective
and beneficent its forms and duties must be restated and clearly defined. The book is
one which ought to be read by all who are interested not merely in African affairs but
in the Colonial policies of the European Powers.</p>

<h3>ANTHROPOLOGY</h3>

<h4 class="left">ARCHAIC ENGLAND. By <span class="smcap">Harold Bayley</span>. London: Chapman &amp; Hall. 1919.
Medium 8vo. pp. 894. 25<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The publishers' announcement informs us that "Mr. Harold Bayley by his graduated
studies in Elizabethan Literature, Symbolism, and the Renaissance has established
his position as an original and interesting thinker." Again, on its paper wrapper the
present work is styled, "this profound and far-reaching contribution to English
Archæology." If a pill were to be puffed in this way the inference might be drawn that
the interested party did not belong to the medical profession. By parity of reasoning one
conjectured before opening the book that Mr. Bayley was not versed in the gentle
tradition of the archæological fraternity. But to read the introduction almost disarms
the critic. Mr. Bayley cannot, he confesses, afford to emulate the Oxford tutor, described
in a novel of Mr. Stephen McKenna, who set himself to write a history of the Third
French Republic, and thirty years later had satisfactorily concluded his introductory
chapter on the origin of Kingship. He complains that his literary hobbies have necessarily
to be indulged more or less furtively in restaurants and railway-trains. Nevertheless
he tries "to keep on as good terms as may be with the exacting Muses of History,
Mythology, Archæology, Philosophy, Religion, Romance, Symbolism, Numismatics,
Folklore, and Etymology." Thus circumstances have forced him to become a literary
"hustler"; and, since self-advertisement is germane to the hustling temper, and moreover
in this case is quite undisguised and naïve, it may almost be forgiven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a></span>
Not that Mr. Bayley wants to be forgiven. It would seem that the hustling and the
hard-hitting tendencies are naturally akin. For the philologists have attacked him on
account of another book. Consequently, in this book he pulverises the philologists one
and all; there is nothing left of them. Nor do the anthropologists come off any better.
Even sex does not protect them. Miss Jane Harrison, for instance, was rash enough to
say that gods evolve from choral dances and similar ceremonies, herein but following
the common opinion that in the development of religion ritual is prior to dogma.
Mr. Bayley will have none of it. "The theory here assumed," he exclaims, "grossly defies
the elementary laws of logic, for every act of ritual must essentially have been preceded
by a thought: Act is the outcome and offspring of Thought: Idea was never the idiot-child
of Act. The assumption that the first idea of God evolved from the personation
of the Sun God in a mystery play or harvest dance is not really or fundamentally a
mental tracking of that God right home, but rather an inane confession that the idea
of God cannot be traced further backward than the ritual of ancient festivals." How
can a reviewer proceed to deal with Mr. Bayley's views without trepidation? <i>Fænum
habet in cornu.</i></p>

<p>"To me," says Mr. Bayley, "the divinities of antiquity are not mere dolls to be
patted superciliously on the head and then remitted to the dustbin. Our own ideals of
to-day are but the idols or dolls of to-morrow, and even a golliwog if it has comforted
a child is entitled to sympathetic treatment." It would have certainly been more sympathetic
if Miss Harrison had called Apollo or Dionysus a gollywog, and let it go at
that. Mr. Bayley goes on to moralise&mdash;and the passage illustrates at once his discursive
manner and the methods of the symbolistic philology&mdash;as follows: "The words <i>doll</i>,
<i>idol</i>, <i>ideal</i>, and <i>idyll</i>, which are all one and the same, are probably due to the island of
Idea, which was one of the ancient names of Crete. Not only was Crete known as
Idæa, but was also entitled Doliche, which may be spelled to-day Idyllic.... We
shall also see as we proceed that the mystic philosophy known to history as the Gnosis
was in all probability the philosophy taught in prehistoric times at Gnossus, the far-famed
capital of Crete. From Gnossus, whence the Greeks drew all their laws and
sciences, came probably the Greek word <i>gnossis</i>, meaning <i>knowledge</i>." Why "probably"?</p>

<p>But to proceed to Mr. Bayley's main contention. He would have us take less pride
in any connection we may have had with the Anglo-Saxons&mdash;were they not Huns?&mdash;and,
contrariwise, think more of our far more worthy ancestors the ancient Britons.
Theirs was a wisdom ultimately derived from the culture-lands of the East. Are not
the identities between Welsh and Hebrew "close and pressing." Is it not the fact that
"entire sentences of archaic Hebraisms are similarly to be found in the now obsolete
Cornish language." Unfortunately the Phœnicians have left no literature. The Greeks
have, however, and we are thus able to connect Achill in Ireland with Achilles, and so
on. Similarly philology proves the truth of the tale that Brutus with his Trojans landed
at Totnes and thence marched to Troynovant or New Troy, now known as London.
Not that the Trojans on their arrival found it any easier than it is now to obtain decent
lodgings in London. For <i>tre</i> (which is obviously Troy) means in Cornish dwelling, and
in French <i>trou</i> means hole. So the earliest Troys "were maybe caves," though they
ultimately became towers or <i>tors</i>; witness the number of the same in the West of
England. It is likewise obvious that Troy, Tyre, and Etruria are from the same root. So
it follows that "the men of Tarshish, Tyre, Troy, or Etruria, towed, trekked, travelled,
tramped, traded, and trafficked far and wide." Indeed, it might almost seem that the
language in which these culture-heroes were wont to express themselves consisted
entirely in the word Troy and its derivatives. But no. Britain was called Albion, and
"Albion suggests Albania." Moreover, "by the present-day Turk the Albanians are
termed Arnaouts. Whether this name has any connection with <i>argonauts</i> is immaterial."
So it evidently is, seeing that "many shiploads of young argonauts from one or another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a></span>
Troy reached the coast of Cornwall." But the proof of this is the fact that so many of
the Cornish names begin with <i>tre</i>. So even the Albanians called themselves Troy for
short.</p>

<p>There are nearly nine hundred pages composed in this vein, and if the reader wants
more he can find it there. Mr. Bayley will not bore him; he wields a facile pen. Again,
he has read all manner of books, good bad and indifferent, and may provide useful
material for anyone whose critical faculty is sufficiently alert. But Troy and the rest of
it&mdash;can this punning philology be seriously meant? Mr. Bayley would connect our
word pun "with the Hebrew <i>pun</i>, meaning <i>dubious</i>." No doubt pundit comes from the
same root; and, if so, Mr. Bayley is welcome to the title.</p>

<h4 class="left">IONS, ELECTRONS, AND IONISING RADIATIONS. By <span class="smcap">J. A. Crowther</span>.
Arnold. 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>In spite of the subject of his book, Dr. Crowther's index is free from the names of
Wien, Lenard, Elster and Geitel, and Stark, to mention a few omissions which are
somewhat surprising. It is true that subsequent reading shows that one of these names is
casually mentioned, but the pages on positive rays, for instance, are happily free from
all reference to the hated Hun and his works&mdash;and, in consequence, are somewhat
misleading. In the first flush we attributed these omissions to Dr. Crowther's intense
patriotism, but further investigation, and a rough classification of other peculiarities,
has convinced us that the misfortune of these men lies not in being German, but in
not having worked at Cambridge. If the book before us had as a sub-title, "Being the
Work of Cambridge Physicists," a source of misunderstanding would be removed. It
consists of an account of the work of the Cavendish school, enriched by free borrowings
from Sir J. J. Thomson's famous <i>Conduction of Electricity through Gases</i>, with occasional
references to the work of "outsiders," not usually acknowledged by name. The chapter
on Photo-electricity will illustrate to those familiar with the subject the peculiarities to
which we allude. We doubt if many physicists will be disposed to admit the author's
claim that the book furnishes "a reasonably complete account of the present state of
the subject."</p>

<h4 class="left">ENGINES OF THE HUMAN BODY. By <span class="smcap">Arthur Keith</span>, F.R.S. Williams &amp;
Norgate. 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>It is a commonplace to talk of the machinery of the body, but it is not widely realised
how close are the analogies which can be drawn between every detail of our physical
structure and some feature or process of modern mechanical engineering. Professor
Keith, realising how very much more most of us know of the working of an engine
which comparatively few of us possess, an internal combustion engine, than of the
working of the engines which we all possess in our muscles, has written a most informing
and entertaining book, in which the mechanism and functions of our bones, muscles,
heart, lungs, joints, brain, and other structures are considered in terms of their engineering
analogies. It is hard to imagine a clearer or more charming exposition of elementary
physiology. The book is based on a course of Christmas Lectures given at the Royal
Institution, lectures primarily intended, as every one knows, for children. While there
is little in the book which cannot be understood by any intelligent boy&mdash;that we do not
add "or girl" is due to no reactionary denial of the full equality of the sexes, but to a
belief that, at present, girls take less interest in, and so are less conversant with, the
working of motor-car engines than boys&mdash;few grown-ups, even medical men, will read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">619</a></span>
it without lively interest or without learning much. There is hardly any function or
structure in our bodies for which Professor Keith does not find a counterpart in iron
or steel&mdash;the internal texture of a bone is likened to Fairbairn's crane, a diagram of a
force pump compared part by part with the diagram of the left ventricular pump of
the heart. The varying length of heel found in different races is considered from the
point of view of its mechanical usefulness in different circumstances, the superiority of
the ape type of arm to the human type for the tasks which confront an ape is made clear
in a few words. A short historical sketch of what Harvey was taught concerning the
blood, contrasted with the wonderful new knowledge which he himself discovered, and
the road by which he arrived at it, affords an admirable example of scientific method.
These are citations at random; the whole book is full of commendable things. The
bearings of recent research, such as the work of Haldane on Respiration, Cannon on
Adrenalin, Starling on Hormones, are skilfully indicated in simple language. We congratulate
Professor Keith on the production of a book of popular science which in clearness,
depth of knowledge, and charm of style challenges comparison with the books
which his great predecessor, Faraday, founded on his "Christmas Lectures."</p>

<h4 class="left">PROBLEMS OF COSMOGONY AND STELLAR DYNAMICS. By <span class="smcap">J. H. Jeans</span>.
Cambridge University Press. 21<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>We welcome the appearance of this book, which is the essay to which the Adams Prize
was adjudged in the year 1917. With the exception of Poincaré's well-known <i>Leçons
sur les Hypothéses Cosmogoniques</i> there is, we think, no other book of recent date dealing
authoritatively with the attractive subject of cosmogony, and in certain respects Mr.
Jeans's book is a considerable advance on Poincaré's. The treatment is more systematic,
and the author's own extensive contributions to the subject add to its value.</p>

<p>The introductory chapter gives a survey of the scientific problem of the origin of the
universe, and points out the various uniformities which we have to explain. It also
includes a brief historical sketch of the various theories of cosmogony put forward, from
the famous nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace up to modern times. This chapter
and the concluding chapter, on the Origin and Evolution of the Solar System, are
accessible to the non-mathematical reader, and enable him to put himself in touch
with the latest observations and speculations on these fascinating themes. The remainder
of the book is highly mathematical, yet the author has presented his analysis so skilfully
that a moderate knowledge of the calculus and dynamical principles suffice for the
following of all the deductions. The general dynamics and criteria of stability and
instability are first developed, and then the classical configurations of equilibrium of
a rotating homogeneous mass&mdash;Maclaurin's spheroids and Jacobi's ellipsoids&mdash;are
handled. Further systematic investigation leads up to the study of the oft-attacked,
formidable problem of pear-shaped figures of equilibrium, which occupied the attention
of Poincaré, G. Darwin, and Liapounoff. So far there has been question of stable
configurations of equilibrium: the author now passes to the dynamical problems presented
when there is no stable equilibrium, remarking that "a statical problem may
or may not admit of solution, but a dynamical problem must always have a solution."
Poincaré's "cataclysm" is for him merely a passage from a statical to a dynamical
investigation. Soon, after summarising the results for a mass of fluid which is incompressible
and homogeneous, he proceeds to consider the case when neither of these conditions
pertain. Here we are presented chiefly with the important advances made by
Mr. Jeans himself. The evolution of rotating nebulæ and of star clusters, of double and
of multiple stars (particular attention being given to the process of fission and the subsequent
motion), come up in turn for consideration, and from these gigantic voyages
through space we return, at the end of the book, to our relatively minute solar system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">620</a></span>
and its evolution. The book is illustrated with beautiful reproductions of photographs
of nebulæ, taken at the Mount Wilson Observatory, and is in every way worthy of its
author and its Press.</p>

<h4 class="left">ARCHIVES OF RADIOLOGY AND ELECTROTHERAPY FOR DECEMBER.
Heinemann.</h4>

<p>The December number of the <i>Archives of Radiology and Electrotherapy</i> contains an
interesting article on the work of the British Association of Radiology and Physiotherapy.
One of the first fruits of its activities is that, at its instigation, the University of Cambridge
has decided to institute a Diploma in Medical Radiology and Electrology. A
knowledge of the properties of the various radiations of electrical origin on nature, of
direct and alternating currents, and of electrotechnics in general, is of such importance
in modern medicine that we heartily welcome the institution of a Diploma which will
guarantee that its possessor has a thorough knowledge of the new and special technique
required for the various electric treatments of to-day. The syllabus of subjects and the
regulations governing the award, which provide, among other things, that the candidate
must hold a recognised medical qualification, are published in full in the number of
the <i>Archives</i> under notice. A study of the syllabus of the course of studies provided at
Cambridge emphasises the range of physical phenomena, which have a therapeutic
value&mdash;radiant heat, X-rays, the rays from radioactive substances, electrolysis, direct
and high frequency currents, and static electricity, to name some of the most important.
Obviously it is time for adequate provision to be made for instructing the medical man
in the theory and manipulation of the machines and devices peculiar to this side of his
art, since the average M.D. has not a very deep knowledge of physics. The only suggestion
we would offer is that some attempt might be made to simplify or standardise the
nomenclature of the subject. A glance at this short notice will show the variety of titles
given to the new therapeutics, and of these the word "electrology," for instance, is
given in Webster as "obsolete or rare." Surely there are sufficient terms already
without reviving it.</p>

<h2>BOOK-PRODUCTION NOTES</h2>

<p class="center">By J. H. MASON</p>

<p class="in0m"><span class="dq">"</span><span class="bigm">M</span><span class="smcap1">ODERN"</span> type is the name by which the design that came into general
use in this country between 1800 and 1808 is designated. (It is the type
face still used in Blue Books.) To quote Luckombe in his <i>Printer's
Grammar</i>, of 1808, "The great improvement which has taken place
of late years in the form of printing types has completely superseded
the Elzevir shape introduced from Holland by the celebrated Caslon. Everyone must
observe, with increasing admiration, the numerous and elegant founts of every size
which have with rapid succession been lately presented to the public." And then
follow specimens from the Fry Type Foundry, the "Quousque tandem abutere, Catilina,
patientia, mostra?" so affected by the older founders that it almost became a proverb for
"type specimen."</p>

<p>Well, modern opinion has gone strongly back to Luckombe, and with good reason.
The only definite quality&mdash;not very definite either&mdash;which calls forth his admiration
is the elegance of the design. I think we may concede this without damaging the case
for the old-style types. The letters are well drawn, carefully and finely drawn, and show
a good sense of proportion and of colour contrast in the thicks and thins and hair-lines
in the size shown, called the Luckombe "French Canon," equivalent to forty-eight
point (about two-thirds of an inch). But is elegant drawing the desirable point in type?
It is not. It tends to keep the single letters distinct units instead of their coalescing
into word, phrase, or even sentence units. For the mind of the reader is partly formed
by the mind of the writer, by his own experience in the manipulation of the pen, and
feels for the onward flow of the pen in the letter design. And this is found at its best in
the Italian writing that developed the Caroline minuscule and formed the model for
the early Venetian types. The letter takes its character from the pen in the hands of a
master of his instrument, and the ink and paper or vellum play their part&mdash;it is not
deliberately drawn and passed on, but arrives in the continuous flow that strives to
keep <i>pari flumine</i> with the stream of thought. The serifs or finishing strokes, <i>e.g.</i>, of
the capital C or T in "modern," are perpendicular palings that shut off relations with
their neighbours; in old style they reach towards their neighbours, as though to join
hands with them. The onward flow is felt in the curves, <i>e.g.</i>, of the small m of old-style
type, but in modern it stands almost coldly self-centred, the elegance strikes us as
primness. The fine lines too are unsuitable for letterpress printing as they are easily
damaged and then the type becomes unsightly. In engraver's lettering on copperplates,
of course, this does not happen, as the fine line is printed from a sunken scratch, not
a knife-like edge in relief. The engraver as a rule only used small groups of words,
not pages of continuous text. (I do not forget Pine&mdash;his Horace dates 1733&mdash;but of him
another time.) I cannot help thinking that modern type is the outcome of a mistaken
standard, that of the engraver; as if the finish of delicate gold-smithing were adopted
for carving in sandstone. To the engraver the hair-line is perfectly simple, to the
typefounder it is a <i>tour-de-force</i>. The old-style design continued the manuscript tradition
of form, with only such changes as the process of typefounding involved, such as
the elimination of ligatures or tied letters. It continued in use till the end of the
eighteenth century, when "elegance" displaced it. In forty years (a short time compared
with the three-and-a-half centuries of old style) old style was revived in the Chiswick
Press <i>Juvenal</i> and <i>Lady Willoughby's Diary</i>, and was enthusiastically received. New
versions of the old-style design were cut, and it has continued in favour ever since.</p>

currents, he thinks of the reviews. I mean by that not the old-established
reviews, which after all are no more than magazines of the first class,
but the living, active, combative reviews, which are the organs of
groups, of literary and intellectual parties.</p>

<p>While the old reviews, in France as in England or in Germany, continued faithfully
during the war to provide their usual articles on contemporary affairs, all the young
French reviews found themselves cut off, the greater part of their staffs having been
mobilised. Since the war they have reappeared, new reviews have been born, and
important additions are announced for the spring. But, taken as a whole, the complexion
of the world of the new reviews shows an aspect sufficiently different from what it
had before the war and above all from what it had twenty years ago.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i> has begun publication again since June 1st. The
members of its pre-war staff meet again intact, because for the most part they belonged
to a generation which reached, or had just passed, its fortieth year in 1914. The most
important among them, the figure round whom the group was first assembled, was
André Gide, and, like Gide, most of them had gone through the Symbolist Movement
between 1890 and 1900. But they were no longer at the age of enthusiastic and violent
prejudices; they cared much for analysis and intelligence and sought above all to see
clear. Hence came their taste for psychological detail and for the literature of introspection,
of which Jean Schlumberger produced poignant examples and which made
the <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i> the natural country of Marcel Proust. Hence also, and
above all, the importance of its critical work, and that state of attentive and impartial
clairvoyance which it has constantly striven to preserve. This clairvoyance did not
exclude ardour or passion; the influence of Péguy, still more that of Claudel, was
obvious in the fiery intellect of Jacques Rivière, now the editor of the review.</p>

<p>Unlike other reviews with an æsthetic bent, the <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i> did not
confine itself to the defence and the illustration of some definite artistic method. It
welcomed, like the <i>Mercure</i> and the <i>Revue Blanche</i> of old days, everything which
seemed to it interesting, original, and bearing the marks of authentic art. Obviously,
for it, the centre of the artistic landscape was filled by the most illustrious of the whilom
Symbolists, those who devoted themselves in solitude to build according to those
mysterious ideal diagrams, drawn by Mallarmé upon a heroic and legendary sand:
Gide, Claudel, Valéry. But the review became the home also of Charles Louis Philippe,
that master of sorrowful tenderness and rending pity&mdash;of Pierre Hamp, who, in his
stories of industrial life, has drawn the world of labour with a power frequently humorous
and sometimes as original as Constantin Meunier's; of Jules Romains, the picturesque
and powerful creator of "Unanimist" prose and poetry.</p>

<p>The <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i> has emerged from its five years' concealment with
the same characteristics. It still attempts to be a milieu of pure art and disinterested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">623</a></span>
literature. But it is almost impossible, in France, for artists to-day to divest themselves
of political preoccupations. They are divided, often fiercely, over this problem: "Should
French thought to-day preserve or abandon its war attitude? Should it remain defiant
towards the foreigner and subordinate everything to the continuance of the intellectual
struggle against Germanism?" The editors of the <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i>, who are
divided on that question, endeavour in their review itself to elucidate it by discussions
amongst themselves.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The <i>Revue Critique des Idées et des Livres</i> has also just reappeared. It was the organ
of a younger generation than that of the <i>Nouvelle Revue Française</i>, and that is why the
majority of its old conductors no longer respond to the call. More than twenty of them,
and notably Pierre Gilbert, who was the heart and soul of them, were killed in action.
As its name indicates, this review is above all concerned with criticism. You find in it
few poems and no novels. The young men who united around it aimed at restoring to
French literature a classic discipline, and fighting all the remains of romanticism from
democracy to symbolism. That is why the review published special numbers dedicated
to Richelieu, to Stendhal, to Mistral, and on the occasion of Rousseau's centenary a
special number of another kind, remarkably violent, devoting to execration the Genevese
whom they held to be the father of French romanticism and the Æolus of all the storms.</p>

<p>The <i>Revue Critique des Idées et des Livres</i> was profoundly influenced by Charles
Maurras. It was the literary organ of the ardent, patriotic generation aroused in France
by his influence and that of Maurice Barrès. Nevertheless, some months before the war
it broke away from <i>L'Action Française</i>; or rather it was that paper, the organ of M.
Maurras, which declared itself unable any longer to commend without reserve the
tendencies of the <i>Revue Critique</i>. This cleavage arose out of some articles in the <i>Revue
Critique</i> which praised the philosophy of M. Bergson. Now <i>L'Action Française</i> had opened
war long before on Bergsonism for reasons which were not philosophic. That is why the
<i>Revue Critique</i>, although still benevolently watched by M. Maurras, was considered by
him as a lapse from orthodoxy.</p>

<p>In its resurrected form it has kept its classical tendencies, its taste for pure criticism,
the intellectual discipline which made it subordinate everything to the national point
of view. But on the other hand it shows an inclination to broaden, to become more
elastic, to take a less rigid and combative attitude than of old. Although most of its
editors are friends of M. Maurras and <i>L'Action Française</i>, it preserves its intellectual
autonomy intact and is no longer attached to a political party. Its rôle seems to be to revive
the old tradition of French classicism. It maintains especially those discussions on the
problems of the day and the eternal problems, those intelligent and passionate debates
which have always given so much animation to young French reviews.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A new review, the work of which will often be in accord with that of the <i>Revue
Critique des Idées et des Livres</i>, is announced for the month of March, and that announcement
has already aroused much interest. This is the <i>Revue Universelle</i>, the organ of the
"Parti de l'Intelligence." This party, which might well have found a less naïve title, is
a nationalist group which proposes to keep the intellect of France in the channels of
national tradition and civic vigilance. It includes almost all the monarchists of the
<i>Action Française</i>, but also a certain number of patriotic writers who are not royalists,
including Camille Mauclair, Daniel Halévy, Edmond Jaloux, Henri Ghéon, and Henri
Massis. It has been founded in opposition to the "Clarté" group of Romain Rolland,
Henri Barbusse, Georges Duhamel, and Pierre Hamp, which unites intellectuals with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">624</a></span>
socialist and pacifist leanings. It is, in the world of letters, a resurrection of the old leagues
of the "Patrie Française" and the "Droits de l'Homme," which flourished at the
time of the Dreyfus affair. But up to the present the majority of French writers have
not enrolled themselves in either body.</p>

<p>The title of the <i>Revue Universelle</i> is based on the desire of the "Parti de l'Intelligence"
to make it an organ for propagating French intellectual influence abroad, for ensuring
the dissemination and establishing the primacy of the classic culture which is bound
up with the French genius. The <i>Revue Universelle</i> will attempt to give to French
nationalism, which has hitherto confined its propaganda to France, an influence over
the world. It is patently a difficult enterprise and one essentially a little paradoxical.
But it will certainly be very interesting and will deserve to be closely watched abroad.
The <i>Revue Universelle</i> will be directed by the clearest and strongest head amongst
contemporary French students of foreign politics, M. Jacques Bainville. The names of
the chief members of the "Parti de l'Intelligence" assure from the start a staff of
the first order. The "Clarté" group has not yet announced its intention of founding
a similar organ.</p>

<p>In the spring there will appear a review in French which will fill a place at present
empty: the <i>Revue de Genève</i>, whose editor will be M. Robert de Traz. This will be a
review essentially European, which will aim at giving an exact picture of intellectual
Europe to-day, and will examine objectively æsthetic, political, religious and moral,
national and international tendencies. Its founders believe that an authoritative position
is assured.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Most of these reviews are or will be reviews of ideas. In contrast to what was the
case twenty years ago the reviews which are devoted to new and bold artistic manifestations
remain on a lower level. Before the war the <i>Phalange</i> was a very live and
picturesque review around which were grouped a number of the old-time Symbolists
and newer writers, from Francis Viélé-Griffin to Guillaume Apollinaire. Almost all the
young made their débuts in the <i>Phalange</i>. It is regrettable that its director, M. Jean
Royère, has decided not to revive it after the war.</p>

<p>The literature which is attached to Futurist and Cubist art has for organ the review
<i>Littérature</i>, rather slender but curious. During the war there began to appear a very
sumptuous Cubist review of literature and art, <i>L'Elan</i>, which was very interesting but
did not survive its fourth number.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It does not come within my present scope to refer to the old reviews, which are well
enough known to English readers. But I must mention that in the last year a new one
has been added to these, the <i>Minerve Française</i>, classical and traditional in tenets and
of an excellent literary standard. Finally, as for the weekly papers, half way between
the dailies and the reviews properly so called, they are not so important in France as
in England. <i>L'Opinion</i> and <i>L'Europe Nouvelle</i> are at present the most alive; those and
the <i>Revue Hebdomadaire</i>, which is in another category.</p>

<p>In fine, the young French reviews to-day are preoccupied with ideas first and art
second. It is difficult for them, even when they are willing, to avoid a definite orientation
towards politics and the problems of politics. They are the natural voices of a
generation which is prevented by actual events from indulging in detached speculations.
But that period of transition will pass and will no doubt soon help forward a
movement in France for the recovery of the precious privileges of spiritual liberty.</p>

<h2>DRAMA</h2>

<h3>MARRIAGE À LA MODE</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IT</span> was impossible to know from the reception of <i>Marriage à la Mode</i> at the Phœnix
Society's production last month whether the numerous complaints of the behaviour
of the audience when <i>The Duchess of Malfi</i> was performed had had effect or not,
for Dryden's comedy puts no strain of any sort on the audience. It is a sign both of
Dryden's greatness and of his weakness. For that "superhuman craftsmanship" of
which Professor Saintsbury speaks is the privilege of a writer whose imagination does
not outrun his powers. There is nothing in his mind that he finds difficult to express.
And the difference in merit between one Dryden play and another is not a difference
of degree in technical accomplishment&mdash;of success in expression&mdash;as it is with greater
poets, but a difference in the value of the subject-matter. When Dryden gets hold of a
good dramatic idea he writes a good play, when his material is deficient in interest
his play is inferior. There are no violent ups and downs in any one play, whereas a poet
of more passion and imagination does more mixed work. Some of Shakespeare's finest
scenes and passages are in his least satisfactory plays, and though Shakespeare's natural
genius for language was immeasurably greater than Dryden's so that it was impossible
for him to write at any length without writing here and there wonderfully, yet he had,
almost necessarily, less absolute command of it. Dryden's was an intellectual mastery
that practically never failed him either in prose or verse. He is not considered to have
had any natural gift for comedy. Hazlitt says: "Dryden's comedies have all the point
that there is in ribaldry, and all the humour that there is in extravagance. I am sorry
that I can say nothing better of them. He was not at home in this kind of writing, of
which he was himself conscious. His play was <i>horse-play</i>. His wit (what there is of it)
is ingenious and scholar-like, rather than natural and dramatic," and more recent
critics have suggested that Dryden was unfitted for the new comedy that became
universal after the Restoration&mdash;the comedy that held a mirror up to Society rather
than to Nature&mdash;since Dryden "was not much a man of society."</p>

<p>It seems to me that this last criticism is largely true, but if he is not witty in the
sense that Congreve and Sheridan are witty, he is often quite as amusing, and I cannot
altogether agree with Hazlitt's pronouncement that his wit was "ingenious and
scholar-like rather than natural and dramatic." Nothing could be more natural, for
example, than the Epilogue to <i>Marriage à la Mode</i>, spoken by Rhodophil, which
convulsed the house at the Lyric Theatre, and I doubt if it would be possible to
find among all the Restoration Comedies an Epilogue so "dramatic"&mdash;revealing such
insight into the feelings aroused by the play in the audience, and making such
effective use of that knowledge. When Rhodophil says:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">628</a></span></p>
<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There are more Rhodophils in this theatre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More Palamedes, and some few wives, I fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet too far our poet would not run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though 'twas well offered, there was nothing done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would not quite the women's frailty bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stript them to the waist, and left them there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the men's faults are less severely shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he considers that himself is one&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some stabbing wits, to bloody satire bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would treat both sexes with less compliment;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would lay the scene at home; of husbands tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wenches taking up their wives i' the Mall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a brisk bout, which each of them did want<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made by mistake of mistress and gallant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our modest author thought it was enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cut you off a sample of the stuff:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spared my shame, which you, I'm sure, would not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you were all for driving on the plot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You sighed when I came in to break the sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set your teeth when each design fell short.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The audience at the Phœnix Society rose with uproarious laughter to each hit, it was
so palpable. Again I find all the comedy scenes, the scenes between Palamede, Doralice,
Rhodophil, and Melantha wholly admirable and exhilarating to a degree. I would
almost gladly give up the whole of Congreve and Sheridan for this poetical, extravagant
and romantic humour. The name of poet still clung to dramatic wits in the time of
Congreve, and Congreve had perhaps some slight excuse for calling himself a poet,
but when the eighteenth century had really arrived, when the abominable Sheridan
came we had got into a prose age indeed. And yet I have no wish to call Sheridan&mdash;and
still less Congreve&mdash;abominable, except by comparison with Dryden. We also
have to acknowledge that the cultivation of verbal wit, of repartee, of elaborate social
rococo, was the expression of the poetic fire instinctively preserving itself in an age so
spiritually unfavourable to romance that it had to make itself externally romantic.
Having lost imagination it fell back on decoration. A whole elaborate social ritual was
built up to provide stimulants to the imprisoned senses. When in <i>The Way of the World</i>
Mrs. Millamant says to Mirabell:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Good Mirabell, don't let us be familiar or fond, nor kiss before folks, like my Lady Fadler
and Sir Francis: nor go to Hyde Park together the first Sunday in a new chariot, to provoke
eyes and whispers, and then never to be seen there together again; as if we were proud of
one another the first week, and ashamed of one another ever after. Let us never visit together
nor go to a play together; but let us be very strange and well-bred: let us be as strange
as if we had been married a great while, and as well-bred as if we were not married at all.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It is a <i>cri-de-cœur</i>. It is of the very essence of poetry in a narrow and worldly age. It
is such passages in Congreve that justify Hazlitt in declaring&mdash;by comparison&mdash;that
Dryden's wit was scholar-like rather than natural, for there is not a passage in Dryden's
comedies so real, in the sense of being so local an expression of that passion for beauty
which haunts the human heart and which in a society of the kind in which Mrs. Millamant
moved will find such odd embodiment and be to ordinary eyes so completely
disguised. In such a passage Congreve proves his right to be called a poet. What poetry
there is in the society with which he is dealing he has expressed; for that appeal of
the fine lady to Mirabell was a clutching at straws, a last despairing attempt at the
preservation of some particle of beauty, of romance in the sordid life in which the
married woman of fashion was about to be engulfed.</p>

<p>The poetry of this scene reaches back to the beautiful scene in <i>Marriage à la Mode</i>
between Palmyra and Leonidas, though, as I have said, Dryden is more romantic, and
so neither Palmyra nor Leonidas are of any age, they are merely the youth of all time.
But surely no one can read the following passage without being moved to admiration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_629" id="Page_629">629</a></span>
of its beautiful ease, its romantic simplicity as contrasted with the romantic luxuriousness
of the Elizabethans:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">

<p>The whole of this beautiful scene was delightful on the stage, and by Palmyra (Miss
Rita Thom), in particular, the verse was exquisitely spoken. One had that experience,
rare indeed in the modern theatre, of subconsciously feeling that the whole audience
was hanging on the words.</p>

<p>Again, what could be finer in its way than the scene&mdash;greatly helped by the stage-production
at the Lyric Theatre, and by Mr. Norman Wilkinson's setting giving it
an appropriate atmosphere of masquerade&mdash;where Doralice and Melantha are in boys'
habits? Here Melantha's French affectation is used with the greatest skill to bring about
a scene which is the very essence of romantic swagger. There are few scenes, if any, in
Congreve or Sheridan that equal in wit this repartee between the pretended boys,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">630</a></span>
Doralice and Melantha, egged on by Palamede and Rhodophil, leading up to Melantha's
final extravagance:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">I'll sacrifice my life for French poetry,</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">and the audience rocked with laughter at Miss Athene Seyler (Melantha) and Miss
Cathleen Nesbitt (Doralice), who were superb in their representation of the parts.</p>

<p>Whenever these old comedies are revived there is always bound to spring up from
somewhere a demand that they should be bowdlerized. Really the misplaced squeamishness
of some men and women is something to marvel at! I have seen nearly every
revue, musical comedy, and play that has been produced in London during the last
two years, and I declare unhesitatingly that there is something radically wrong with
the mentality of the people who can go habitually to the London theatres and music-halls
and yet find that there is anything "filthy" about Dryden. Certainly there is no
innuendo in Dryden, he is frankly outspoken. But filthy! Shade of Charles Lamb!
What is to be done with such people? Not once during the whole performance of
<i>Marriage à la Mode</i> was there an occasion when the most sensitive of young girls could
have felt even momentarily uncomfortable. Such was far from being the case with a
play that had quite a long run at a London theatre not long ago, to which, as far as I
know, no one objected!</p>

<p>But I do not want to resist any attempt to make the Phœnix Society bowdlerize
Dryden on that ground. Dryden&mdash;even more than Congreve&mdash;is inoffensive. There
are dramatists with dirty minds; we often have had their works performed in London&mdash;adapted
from the French or in their native English&mdash;but even these no one, I hope,
would suppress. Dryden emphatically is not one of this class. A cleaner, more wholesome
writer never put pen to paper, and the morbid squeamishness that objects to
Dryden is the squeamishness of ill-health. It is a case for the doctor, for it is expressive
of a pathological malady. On the subject as a whole it would seem an apt occasion to
quote some sentences of Lamb's celebrated defence of Congreve, Farquhar, and
Wycherley, as there appear to be people who have not heard of it. Lamb explains that
these comedies have disappeared from the stage of his day&mdash;and he lived at the beginning
of the age of Mrs. Grundy&mdash;because "the times cannot bear them." It is not alone,
he adds, the occasional licence of the dialogue, it is that they will not stand the moral
test that is so ridiculously applied to them. The age screws everything up to that.
"Idle gallantry in a fiction, a dream, the passing pageant of an evening, startles us in
the same way as the alarming indications of profligacy in a son or ward in real life
should startle a parent or a guardian. We have no such middle emotions as dramatic
interests left." Pursuing this idea, he adds: "We carry our fireside concerns to the
theatre with us. We do not go thither like our ancestors, to escape from the pressure
of reality so much as to confirm our experience of it; to make assurance double, and
take a bond of fate. We must live our toilsome lives twice over, as it was the mournful
privilege of Ulysses to descend twice to the shades." Here Lamb with the extraordinary
penetration characteristic of that rare mind hit upon one of the principal causes of the
bankruptcy of the theatre during the hundred years that were to follow him. We are,
even at this moment, struggling to get free from that literal-mindedness which is the
soul of materialism and which would fetter us down to what it calls realism and will
have no extravagance of thought or language, and for whom an escape into the free
speech of the theatre&mdash;an escape most necessary and most salutary&mdash;is, if you please,
filth! "All that neutral ground of character," laments Lamb, "that happy breathing-place
from the burthen of a perpetual moral questioning&mdash;the sanctuary and quiet
Alsatia of hunted Casuistry&mdash;is broken up and disenfranchised, as injurious to the
interests of society. The privileges of the place are taken away by law. We dare not
dally with images, or names, of wrong. We bark like foolish dogs at shadows. We dread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">631</a></span>
infection from the scenic representation of disorder and fear a painted pustule. In our
anxiety that our morality should not take cold we wrap it up in a great blanket just out
of precaution against the breeze and the sunshine. I confess for myself that (with no
great delinquencies to answer for) I am glad of a reason to take an airing beyond the
diocese of the strict conscience&mdash;not to live always in the precincts of the law courts&mdash;but
now and then, for a dream-while or so, to imagine a world with no meddling restrictions&mdash;to
get into recesses whither the hunter cannot follow me." And concludes Lamb,
with fine common sense, "I come back to my cage and my restraint, the fresher and
more healthy for it. I wear my shackles more contentedly for having respired the breath
of an imaginary freedom."</p>

<p>It is not often given to any one man to have said the last word on a subject, but I
think that on this question Charles Lamb has said the last word. Modern science lends
its support to his judgment. The psycho-analyst is beginning to realise that the damage
inflicted by socially necessary inhibitions can only be cured by art. It is to be hoped
that we will hear less and less of this canting nonsense of "filth" applied to such
noble and beautiful work as Dryden's. It is also to be hoped that the Phœnix Society
may have a long life, for in the two productions it has so far given us it has more justified
its existence than has any society I know of founded in the last dozen years.</p>

<h2>THE FINE ARTS</h2>

<h3 class="left">The National Gallery</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> National Gallery nowadays is a constant source of novelty. The familiar
pictures which have been hidden so long are reappearing in brighter and
more deliberate surroundings, and we are compelled to see them anew instead
of merely battening on our past impressions. Not all the rooms are equally
successful in their mural decoration, but nearly everywhere an improvement
has been effected on the old gloomy colours. The function of decorations in a gallery
is unostentatiously to show the works of art in the best contemporary light. For it
is one of the paradoxes of classical art that, although its beauty is immortal, each
generation sees this beauty from its own point of view. In fact, the immortality
consists precisely in the possibility of continual recreation, and the environment is an
outward assistance to such a process. Mr. C. J. Holmes is only obeying the spirit of
the period in introducing the clear colours of full daylight. It is to be hoped that the
British Museum authorities will follow suit and make their sculpture rooms slightly
more exhilarating.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting recent additions are the purchases made at the sale of
the Degas Collection in 1918. Many of them have been exhibited already for some time,
but a few have only appeared lately, and several are still in the background. The later
appearances include the large and rather prosaic study of soldiers, by Manet, and a
finely-drawn but photographically-painted portrait by Ingres. In the neighbourhood
of the Manet is an interesting comparison between two Corots, one painted in Italy
early in his career, the other in his later, more typical period. The early landscape reveals
an aspect of Corot that is little known in England. The conception has a clearness and
thoroughness that is often lacking in his twilight fantasies, which are inclined to be
stereotyped. From the Studd Bequest we have two interesting but oversweet figure
and landscape sketches by Puvis de Chavannes.</p>

<p>Our collection of French paintings is growing, but we want many more&mdash;if not
permanently, then on loan; why not?</p>

<p>The most notable English additions during 1919 are the three Whistlers from the
Studd Bequest. The <i>Lady with the Fan</i> is inclined to be sentimental; the <i>River Nocturne</i>
has considerable charm, but it is on too large a scale for so slender a theme. The
<i>Nocturne</i> with the fireworks is the most nearly perfect.</p>

<p>When the rearrangement of the Gallery is complete many pictures may have to be
kept downstairs. There are several at present on view in the English rooms which one
hopes will be reserved for the curious and the importunate. There is also a large and
unfortunate compilation by Holman Hunt hung in one of the approaches which might
be better elsewhere.</p>

<p>The new El Greco is a very important acquisition, although it was probably not a
quarter the price of the family group by Romney. It contains the quintessence of El
Greco's nervously hard and dramatically intense vision (no, Mr. Roger <span class="locked">Fry,<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> not melodramatic!),
and it is not subject to exotic Venetian influences, as is his other composition
on the same wall. It has been carefully cleaned, and the result is a triumph.
Apparently under the old blackened varnish the colours were preserved with all their
original purity and poignancy. The picture looks as though it were painted yesterday.
In another sense too it is very modern. I say this reluctantly because I am opposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">633</a></span>
an arbitrary division into ancient and modern, which implies an unwarranted depreciation
of the "ancient." Obviously the "modern" is a mere passing phase, a torch which
is hurried through the darkened rooms of the past, lighting up now this room, now that.
It is in fact a question of temporary interest and relevancy, not of objective merit,
although the latter may only be fully understood through the medium of the former.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_29" id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Mr. Fry is compelled to admit a dramatic content. But, he says, it is "melodramatic"
(implying it should not be there). This is a subtle evasion. For what if it were not
melodramatic?</p></div>

<h3 class="left">Recent Sculpture by Jacob Epstein: Leicester Galleries</h3>

<p>Mr. Epstein is a great portrait sculptor. He has a wonderful power of "living into"
his models. He produces not only a likeness, but also that kind of likeness which we
can enjoy without knowing the original, and in a certain sense even more than the
original when known. For he sees what we should scarcely be able to see without his
vigorous assistance. Standing before one of his portrait heads we have the consciousness
of some magnetising influence, evoking all kinds of subterranean thoughts and
emotions; we are drawn out of ourselves into our external objective vortex.</p>

<p>It is objective and yet essentially the creation of Mr. Epstein's "realistic" vision.
Realistic is a difficult and dangerous word, but we know what is meant by it, although
often when we try to explicate that knowledge still further we arrive at something
which the word does not, or should not, or need not, mean. It should not mean, for
instance, photographic, or immoral, or ugly. It may contain a consciousness of all
these elements without being them, for to be conscious of them surely means to supersede
and dominate them. "Realistic," of course, might be extended so as to cover everything,
but in the present instance of ordinary usage it is limited to one particular aspect
of things, which, curiously enough, is rather a negative than a positive one. It is the
positive consciousness of negatives such as difficulty, failure, struggle, pain: it is the
intense and overpowering desire to know them fully, to drain the imaginative experience
of them to the dregs, because once they have taken a hold on our awareness, only by
that means can we triumph over them.</p>

<p>Not only does Mr. Epstein endeavour to bring home to himself and to us in his character
studies a sense of individualised conflict (though he is never gloomy), he often
approves of sternness and ruggedness as good in themselves; he enjoys the titanic
groping of life. And it is perfectly true that without some sort of a fight existence would
be hopelessly inert and hyper-æsthetic; but we do want sometimes the calm and
untroubled pleasure of attainment. Indeed only the complete process conjoining the
two opposites is completely good, yet we inevitably stress now the one, now the other
facet, placing in the centre of our consciousness either the fact of struggle and failure
or the fact of success: for art is itself part of the process. And Mr. Epstein's art stresses
the "realistic" side, not only in the sense that he is in desire revolting from it, but also
that he appreciates it, enjoying the process as much as the arrival at the goal. For instance,
he has made several studies of his own baby, over whom he has kept his head severely.
Indeed he seems to have been too ferociously interested in the animalism and precocious
ugliness of a small baby to have been at all tempted to idealise; at the same time he is
impressed with the baby's vigour and vitality.</p>

<p>Sometimes it seems to me he loses sight of the whole in the elaboration of expressive
detail. In the bust of Lord Fisher in the War Museum Exhibition he has obviously
attempted to produce the leathery, wrinkled texture of an old man's skin, because he
saw it as a significant feature. But in the effort to get this difficult effect he has lost
sight of the significance and produced a mere verisimilitude of wrinkledness. Similarly
in his <i>Christ</i>, the feature which arrests us most is the clay-like gruesomeness of the
loosened wrappings. We shudder at the faint suggestion of decomposition and we are
wounded by the slit in the opened palm of the hand. But practically the whole force
of the composition has spent itself in these subsidiary details.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">634</a></span></p>

<h3 class="left">Paintings by Duncan Grant: Wm. B. Paterson and Carfax &amp; Co. Ltd.,
5 Old Bond Street</h3>

<p>This is a very important exhibition, and confirms the report which has been current for
some time that Mr. Duncan Grant is an artist of unusual originality. I am deliberately
emphatic, not only because I am very enthusiastic about some of these pictures, but
also because I feel sure that many people will have been "put off" from the first by
a few of them, in which Mr. Duncan Grant, under the influence of the modern abstractionist
and pattern-making theories, has taken undue liberties with the human body.
Even in these pictures there is much that is very fine, but it is quite independent of the
stupid distortions which only have a marring or comic effect. But consider, for instance,
the Still Life No. 23, <i>Bowl, Skull, and Jar</i>. Whatever other criticism may be levelled
against it, it is immune from the charge of arbitrariness. Personally, I have nothing but
praise for it, as being a magnificent piece of lyrical painting. There are several other
pictures&mdash;landscapes, still lives, interiors&mdash;possessing the same exquisite qualities,
notably Nos. 2, 4, 7, 9, 12, 21. The last named, styled <i>Juggler and Tight Rope Walker</i>,
which is in many ways the most brilliant of the whole collection, does evince here and
there a certain exaggeration. This, however, can be overlooked because it does not
rivet our attention.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in No. 29, <i>Venus and Adonis</i>, the placing of the lady's neck on
her left-hand shoulder, with the consequent elongation of the right-hand shoulder,
stirs up in our minds a whole swarm of general reflections, so that our æsthetic enjoyment
of other real values in the picture is practically swamped. It is true that in caricatures
we allow without cavil all sorts of liberties. But only because the result is expressive,
and actually where we appreciate the caricature we do not notice any distortion, we
see the work as convincingly <i>true</i>.</p>

<h3 class="left">The Black Country. Drawings by Edward Wadsworth: The Leicester
Galleries. (January.)</h3>

<p>Mr. Wadsworth has almost found himself in his Black Country pictures, or better he
has found a real object which coincides with his particular "vorticist" predilection.
Continually is he obsessed with a certain forked-lightning pattern which zigzags over
the world. Where it does not he often puts it there and, partially removing the world,
leaves a pattern. However, in the slag heaps and belching chimneys and curved canals
and splintered roofs of the Black Country, at any rate sometimes, this pattern comes
back to earth, and the result is a striking picture. Vorticism and Futurism, in so far as
they are art tendencies, represent the scientist and business man of the nineteenth
century emerging painfully into emotional expression. Mr. Wadsworth and the
"Futurists" have not been the first to discover science and industry artistically, but
hitherto stress has been laid on the general impressiveness, the mystery and atmospheric
volume of the subject. Mr. Wadsworth's particular contribution concerns the sheer
joy in brutal mechanical movement and in the deadly bulk and solidity of industrial
products and by-products. His best drawings are of ladle slag heaps, consisting of
metallic-looking boulders hurled out into a desolation that yet teems with the energy
that made and discarded them.</p>

<h2>MUSIC</h2>

<h3>THE RESURRECTION OF AN OPERA</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IT</span> was Dr. Vaughan Williams who, sometime about 1912 or 1913, suggested
Purcell's opera <i>The Fairy Queen</i> for performance at Cambridge. In 1911 Mr.
Clive Carey and a few others had organised at Cambridge a performance of <i>The
Magic Flute</i>. Mozart's last and greatest work for the stage was in those days
not so familiar to English audiences as it is now. It had not been seen in this
country, as far as I am aware, since it was given by the students of the Royal College
of Music about twenty years ago. That it should be attempted by Cambridge amateurs
was regarded as preposterous&mdash;even Covent Garden had shied at it. But the promoters
of the Cambridge opera were less nervous. If they had confidence, it was a
confidence in Mozart and in the opera rather than in themselves. They knew the
opera intimately enough to have convinced themselves that the chief difficulty of <i>The
Magic Flute</i> lay not in the extreme compass of the two parts of Sarastro and the Queen
of Night, but first in the necessity for a clear and logical exposition of the story,
secondly in the complication of the ensemble numbers, and thirdly perhaps in the
psychology of what is really the most difficult part of all, the Orator (Der Sprecher).
If singers could be found who were prepared to sing the parts of Gabriel and Raphael
in <i>The Creation</i>, they could make at least a decent show of Sarastro and the Queen.
Ensemble singing was merely a matter of musicianship and hard work; the personality
of the Orator was of necessity a question largely of luck in finding the right man and
coaching him intelligently. The producers of the Cambridge performance were
guided by two principles, to aim at clearness and unity of style rather than at magnificence,
and to pin their faith to a great dramatic composer rather than to a star cast.</p>

<p>The reception given to <i>The Magic Flute</i> encouraged them to consider the possibility
of performing another opera in 1914. Several operas had been passed in review when
Dr. Vaughan Williams made his brilliant suggestion, a suggestion which was very
quickly adopted. The opera was prepared for performance and put into rehearsal
in the summer of 1914, with a view to bringing it out in December of that year. The
musical portions of the first three acts were well in hand and most of the dresses designed
at the moment when war was declared. As soon as the war was definitely over, and
Cambridge had begun to resume something of its normal aspect, the opera was resumed,
although a bare half-dozen of the original cast remained, and <i>The Fairy Queen</i> was
finally presented for the first time to a modern audience on February 10th of this year.</p>

<h4 class="left">Purcell and Shakespeare</h4>

<p>It may be of interest to those who witnessed the performance to learn something of
the peculiar problems which confronted the producers and of the principles on which
they tried to solve them. The only material available at that time was the Purcell
Society's full score and a copy of the original libretto of 1692. The British Museum
possessed also the second edition of the libretto (1693). The first thing to do was to
prepare and print an acting version and a vocal score. It must not be supposed that
<i>The Fairy Queen</i> is an opera in the modern sense, like <i>Dido and Æneas</i>. It is an
abridged and altered version of <i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i>, into each act of which is
introduced a sort of <i>ballet-divertissement</i> with songs and choruses. These musical
episodes have practically nothing to do with the play. In Act I. Titania enters with her
fairies and orders music to entertain the Indian Boy. This is interrupted by the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">636</a></span>
of a drunken poet, who is blindfolded and pinched by the fairies. In Act II.,
instead of "Ye Spotted Snakes," there is a long allegorical scene introducing Night,
Secrecy, Mystery, and Sleep. In Act III. a <i>divertissement</i> of a broadly comic character
is commanded by Titania for the amusement of Bottom. In Act IV. Oberon summons
up a pageant of Phœbus and the Four Seasons in honour of his reconciliation
with Titania, and lastly the fairies provide in Act V. the most magnificent
and extravagant show of all to celebrate the nuptials of Theseus and Hippolyta. It
will be seen that there is a certain amount of dramatic reason and also of artistic unity
and contrast about these musical episodes. The first, for the Indian Boy, is fantastic
and childlike; the second, for Titania, voluptuous and mysterious; the third, for Bottom,
half-comic and half-erotic; the fourth, for Oberon, is a sort of Sun-God's festival; the
last, for Theseus and Hippolyta, an epithalamium.</p>

<p>The first difficulty to be faced was that of the Shakespeare dialogue, which is all spoken,
not sung. Should the librettist's textual alterations be kept, or the original restored?
Had the textual alterations been violent enough to stamp the whole play as belonging
definitely and unmistakably to the age of Dryden we should have had no hesitation in
sticking to them. We were quite clear from the start that we meant to produce Purcell's
opera and not Shakespeare's play. But the alterations to the text of Shakespeare were
just enough to be irritating to an audience whom we assumed to be familiar with Shakespeare,
and troublesome to actors who were probably in the same case. The chances
were that the actors would forget the alterations here and there and return unconsciously
to the original, and that the audience would merely suppose that they had not learnt their
parts properly. Besides, the opera was so long that drastic cuts were imperative. Here
again we at once decided that as far as was practicable it should be Shakespeare and
not Purcell that was to be cut. We therefore started by restoring the original text of
Shakespeare in all the scenes which had not been cut altogether by the librettist, and
then proceeded to prune the Shakespeare down until we had reached either our time-limit
or the limit of intelligibility. The latter was reached first, and on that we proceeded
to cut down Purcell. An obvious course was to adopt the version of 1692,
rejecting the scene of the Drunken Poet, and the two songs, <i>Ye Gentle Spirits</i> and <i>The
Plaint</i>, which were added in 1693. But the scene of the Drunken Poet was too good
to throw away. The two songs we abandoned with some reluctance on account of
their singular beauty; but they could easily be spared from the point of view of the
stage. Indeed <i>The Plaint</i> would have been impossible to accept; it is dragged in for
no reason by special request of Oberon, and is not only extremely long, but profoundly
melancholy and totally inappropriate to the cheerful atmosphere of the Epithalamium.</p>

<p>One of the librettist's alterations was to transfer the whole of <i>Pyramus and Thisbe</i>
to the rehearsal scene in the wood. The players act it "in our habits as we shall play
it before the Duke," and the interruptions of Theseus and the rest are assigned to Puck.
Here again we restored the original, if only to save time. The idea then occurred to
us to save the play by having it acted in dumb show during the <i>Entry Dance</i> of Act V.
This solved the problem of what to do with this particular dance-tune; it gave us
additional time to prepare the Chinese scene behind the tableau-curtain, it saved the
time occupied by the play, and spared us the very tedious mirth of all the knockabout
business which in <i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> has now become traditional. Further,
it brought the clowns in again at the appropriate moment, and, what was more important,
it associated Shakespeare more closely with Purcell's music. The little pantomime was
worked out at rehearsal entirely by the actors themselves. They first walked through
the directions of the <i>Pyramus and Thisbe</i> play; then the music was played and the
action tried with it. No further alteration was needed at subsequent rehearsals, for
it so happened that every one of the actors was musical, and they stepped and moved
to Purcell's notes by natural instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">637</a></span>
There remained still a few bits of music to be disposed of. In the seventeenth
century people had to sit in the theatre for a long time before the play began, and to
pass the time a concert was provided, consisting of a <i>First Musick</i>, or <i>Second Musick</i>,
and lastly the <i>Overture</i>. Under modern conditions it would have been more in accordance
with the spirit of Purcell to send our orchestra out into the street to play the First
and Second Musick to the queue that was waiting to enter the pit and gallery, but since
we could not imagine that police regulations would permit this, we utilised the four
little pieces at different points as incidental music to the play. In so doing we knew
that we were untrue to the strict traditions of Purcell's day; but we did not wish to
cut these pieces out altogether, and we further thought that they would help to Purcellize
the Shakespeare. We were somewhat surprised to find that several of the audience
seemed to expect <i>A Midsummer-Night's Dream</i> in its entirety, once the play had started.
Our assumption, which apparently was wrong, was that everybody knew Shakespeare's
play practically by heart, and that we need do no more than just indicate its outlines,
leaving the rest to be filled up by the imagination under the inspiration of Purcell's
music.</p>

<h4 class="left">Purcell and His Orchestra</h4>

<p>The opera is scored for the usual Purcell band. In the big instrumental numbers
two trumpets, kettle-drums, and two hautboys are added to the string. A few numbers
have two flutes, but flutes and hautboys never occur simultaneously, which leads me
to think that in Purcell's days the flutes and hautboys were generally played by the same
players. The solos are accompanied sometimes by violins and bass in three parts,
more often by the harpsichord and bass alone, the other instruments playing no more
than the <i>ritornelli</i>. On the question of orchestration we never had a moment's hesitation.
We were determined from the very first that we would not add a single note to
Purcell's score. This meant, of course, that a very serious responsibility would be
thrown on the harpsichord. We had experimented once with a harpsichord in a
Bach Concerto at a concert, with the very embarrassing discovery that the harpsichord
player could hardly hear a note that he played, while the unfortunate conductor could
hear nothing else but the harpsichord. To the audience, as a matter of fact, the result
was quite satisfactory. The harpsichord in the theatre was a more perilous problem,
especially as we were not able to have any rehearsal of any kind in the theatre until the
day before the first performance. Would the harpsichord be audible in the audience?
Would it be audible on the stage? Would it stay in tune under the very variable conditions
of temperature? Would one harpsichord be enough, or ought we to have two, as
Hasse had at the Dresden Opera House? Would the harpsichord be monotonous as
well as inadequate? Ought we to have in addition a pianoforte or possibly a harp?
We decided to do the very best we could with one harpsichord and chance it. In view of
the probability that the harpsichord might become amazingly monotonous, the harpsichord
part was considered with the greatest possible care and no pains spared to make
it as varied, as effective, and as expressive as possible. Once in the theatre, the instrument
was tried in various positions until the right place for it was found. It was clearly
audible both on the stage and in all parts of the house without ever becoming too insistent.
Here I must say how deeply we were indebted to the sensitive musicianship of the player,
an undergraduate in his first year, who, although he had never placed his fingers on a
harpsichord until about a fortnight before the performance, was gifted with exactly
that fine sense of scholarship in music which is the first essential of the complete <i>maestro
al cembalo</i>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">EDITORIAL NOTES</h2>

<p class="drop-cap5"><span class="smcap1">LAST</span> month we referred here to the fact that a deputation was to wait
on Mr. Fisher to press the claim of the drama to State encouragement.
The deputation, which included critics, actors, and representatives
of all the most important societies concerned, was received
on March 13th. Whatever may or may not come of it, its mere reception in
Whitehall is an event which marks an important step in the evolution of
the official attitude towards the drama, which, until recently, was conceived
as a thing with which the State had no relations save that of blue-penciller.
For this we may chiefly thank the new and vigorous British Drama League
and its secretary, Mr. Geoffrey Whitworth. Several resolutions were laid
before the Minister. With some of the proposals commended to him he had,
as Minister of Education, nothing to do; but his reply to the deputation
was very sympathetic in tone and showed full cognisance of the part that
dramatic representation might play in national life.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>We do not propose to dwell at length upon all the suggestions which,
tentatively or confidently, were made by the deputation or the Conference
which instructed it. One of them we frankly dislike, and that is the proposal that
the Universities should recognise the new status of the drama by establishing
faculties of the drama. Those who propose this cannot mean merely that
our dramatic inheritance should be studied as literature; for the encouragement
of such study falls within the scope of the English schools, which are
becoming more important and more intelligently conducted every year.
They cannot mean, either, we suppose, that dramatic representation should
be encouraged; that is not the job of a faculty unless a Doctorate or Baccalaureate
of Histrionics be contemplated. They can only intend that a theoretical
and practical training in the dramatist's art should be given, that a scientific<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">642</a></span>
study of the principles&mdash;technics or some such thing would be the word&mdash;of
dramatic writing, based on the analysis of admitted masterpieces and (perhaps)
admitted failures, should be followed, or accompanied, by the writing,
under surveillance, of new dramatic works. It is conceivable. We met
recently a lady who had won the Doctorate of Philosophy in an American
University. She had nothing about her of the grey sobriety of the metaphysician
or the ethicist; and, questioned, she stated that she had taken her
degree in the School of Short-Story Writing. Well, we know those American
academic treatises on short-story writing: champion instruments for taking
the bloom off any work of art and killing the artistic impulses of any student
simple enough to surrender himself to them. And though we do not know,
and we don't think posterity will know, the plays written by those graduates
of American Universities who have gone out into the world as dramatic
writers of approved competence, we have seen some of the manuals on which
they also have pastured: manuals admirable only as subjects for burlesque.
In the teaching of literature criticism of the drama, examination (if you like)
of the elements of dramatic construction, has its place with other forms of
criticism; the history of the drama with other sorts of history. There is no
harm done, and a certain stimulus may be given to the talented, if students
are encouraged to write "original" works, and if a certain amount of academic
credit is given for such works. But a school of dramatic production,
or of novel-writing, or of poetical composition ... may we be saved from that!
The way in which teachers may develop dramatic, as other literary, talent is by
encouraging the intelligent reading of good literature, and by demonstrating
the grand truth that its roots lie in life fearlessly observed and passionately
felt.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The more amateur dramatic performance&mdash;of works which have some
imaginative quality in them&mdash;the better. If the Board of Education, which
has already (we think) done a good deal to encourage both music and
mimetics in the schools, can still further humanise the curriculum, all the
richer will be the community, all the more amusing will be the lives of the
children, and, in the end, all the richer will be our art. The Universities may
probably be left to take care of themselves. Very likely a word of encouragement
from a Minister of Education, a Prime Minister, or an Archbishop of
Canterbury might in some places remove obscurantist opposition or secure
facilities which have not been forthcoming. But young men are not children.
They can arrange things for themselves, with the assistance of sympathetic
and not necessarily official elders. And that the junior members of the
Universities, since the war, have been taking with a new zest to dramatic production
is a matter of common observation. If we go no farther than Oxford
and Cambridge we have seen during the present term&mdash;eight weeks old
as we write&mdash;the successful production of Mr. Hardy's <i>Dynasts</i> by the
O.U.D.S., and at Cambridge the Marlowe Society's production of <i>The White<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">643</a></span>
Devil</i> and the revival of Purcell's <i>Faerie Queene</i>, organised by Dr. Rootham,
Mr. Clive Carey, and Mr. Dent. This last was an imposing operation: a
large acting cast, a ballet, an orchestra, dresses and scenery were supplied
by junior members of the University and local ladies. Next term the A.D.C.
are performing a modern comedy, and <i>Comus</i> is amongst the other things
mooted for May Week. Organisation from above is nothing as good as this,
especially if it takes the form of organisation of an academic course.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>But the place of the drama in education is too large and difficult a subject
to be dealt with in detail here: what we do wish to say a few words about is
what, after all, was the main object of the deputation's visit to Whitehall,
though it had little to do with the Minister of Education, as such&mdash;we mean
the National Theatre. It was to this that the speakers for the deputation,
particularly Dr. Courtney and Sir Sidney Lee, chiefly addressed themselves.
Here also we have a subject which invites extended treatment if we begin
to contemplate the possible relations between public authorities generally
and the drama. It is reported that in South London a Town Council
desires to give help out of the rates to the new operatic venture at the Surrey
Theatre; and before long we shall probably hear suggestions that where
local authorities wish to maintain theatrical enterprises they should obtain
grants-in-aid from the Government. That is a large and a complicated,
not to say a controversial, matter. But the National Theatre question can be
strictly localised. All we need ask is: Ought there, or ought there not, to be
a permanently endowed institution in London where the best English plays
should be produced regardless of commercial risks, and ought, or ought not,
the State to lend its moral and financial support to such an institution?
And since there exists already a National Theatre Fund, which has acquired
a site for a playhouse, we are faced ultimately with the question whether
the Government should take a direct financial and administrative interest
in that scheme.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>The National Theatre scheme grew out of the preparations for commemorating
the Tercentenary of Shakespeare's death&mdash;which fell in 1916, during
the war. In 1904 a committee was organised, and in 1905 it was resolved,
at a Mansion House meeting, to collect funds for an architectural memorial
and, if possible, for a small theatre in which Elizabethan and other plays
could be performed. In 1908 another Mansion House meeting was held, at
which it was proposed to erect a statue in Portland Place (so convenient
because it is very wide and nobody ever goes there) at a cost of not less than
£100,000. Such an expenditure on such an object horrified a great many
people. For some time&mdash;notably after the publication of an admirable book by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">644</a></span>
Messrs. Granville Barker and William Archer&mdash;interest had been growing in
the proposal for a National Theatre. The £100,000 statue scheme naturally
led to the suggestion that a theatre would be a better memorial than a statue,
and that two birds could be killed with one stone if the National Theatre
were to be the Shakespeare Memorial. The notion was accepted; the two
movements were amalgamated; and a fund for a Shakespeare Memorial
Theatre was opened by a committee of which Lord Plymouth was chairman
and Sir Israel Gollancz secretary. The public appeal was not so successful
as it might have been. By 1910 the sum of £90,000 had been collected, of
which £70,000 came from a single donor, Sir Carl Meyer. The committee
spent £61,000 on a site in Gower Street, from which a certain revenue has
since been received. Then came the war. The collection of money stopped,
and it has not (so far as we are aware) been made clear to the public what
the committee has been doing since the Armistice, what it proposes to do in
the near future, and when it intends to make a bid for the rest of the four
or five or (it may now be) six or seven hundred thousand that is required for
the erection and endowment of a theatre.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>Now it is evident that sooner or later the project must be resumed and a
further appeal made to the public. It is possible that this appeal will be more
successful than the last. After all, we hear of twenty new millionaires in Bradford
alone, and any one of these could contribute a large portion of the whole
sum required, thereby earning fame and, very likely, a public honour better
deserved than some. It is obvious on the face of it that if the Government is
known to look on the scheme with a benevolent eye its chances of success
will be brighter. Is it impossible that, should the whole sum not be raised
from private persons, the Government should guarantee a subsidy? This
would, of course, involve some measure of Government control, and the
presence of Government representatives on the permanent body of Trustees,
who would sit there precisely as do the two Government directors recently
appointed to the Board of a Cellulose Company. We say this without prejudice
to the general question of the relations between the community and
the theatre. The idea has been mooted that municipalities should subsidise
theatres and that the Government should assist them with grants-in-aid.
It is attractive, and a Whitehall Committee might well be appointed to
explore it. But the National Theatre is a distinct and peculiar proposal.
What we desire is that there should be in the capital one house with a
position resembling that of the Comédie Française, or the Old Imperial
Opera House in Petrograd, a house devoted to the production of good plays,
provided with a stock company, and guaranteed against all the fluctuations
of fortune. In brief, the revival of the English classic plays should be systematised.
It should not be left to chance whether an Englishman should live
and die without having an opportunity of seeing a competent, or indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">645</a></span>
any, performance of <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, of Marlowe's <i>Faustus</i>, of <i>The
Duchess of Malfi</i>, of <i>The Critic</i>, of <i>The Knight of the Burning Pestle</i>, of <i>The
Way of the World</i>, of <i>The Broken Heart</i>: to mention but a few of the interesting
plays that ordinary managers can scarcely ever be expected to put on.
For the ordinary manager must almost always build on hopes of a long run.
These plays probably would not hold the stage for long runs; and if one of
them did have a long run, it would only mean that during that run no other
play would be visible at the theatre where it was being produced. Some of
Shakespeare's plays have scarcely any prospect of being produced in our
time in a London theatre, save only at the "Old Vic.," which has so
finely struggled for existence, and so gloriously (though how far does its
permanence rest on the continuance of a single life?) succeeded. Theatres
are limited in number. They have become the subjects of violent speculation.
Even if a private man with the most ambitious of plans obtained a theatre
we should have no guarantee that he would not pass his theatre on next
day to somebody who was willing to give him a handsome profit for his
lease and hoped to recoup himself by a year's run of revue or American melodrama.
We conceive that if publishing houses were like theatres, and could
issue only one work at a time, Messrs. Methuen (we hope they will allow us
to use their name as an illustration) might well be excused if, as between
Shakespeare (of whom they publish admirable editions) and <i>Tarzan of the
Apes</i> they chose, at this moment, the latter. There is a public for both kinds,
but the smaller at any given moment (though over a long period the larger)
is very badly catered for in the theatrical world, where everybody is bidding
for the great rewards that the larger public can bestow, and is, at present,
under the necessity of paying a "shortage" rent, which will not go down
unless some prodigiously rich and adventurous syndicate starts building
new theatres wholesale.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>How far a National Theatre, especially a State-assisted National Theatre,
can be expected, or will consider it its duty, to produce new plays of merit is
doubtful. If that is one of its functions it will not be its chief function; were
it so its work would be the centre of perpetual tempests of controversy, and
its controllers would learn what lobbying means. It will have quite enough
to do if it concentrates on the systematic revival, on repertory lines, of the
best classic plays, with occasional production of foreign plays and of old
plays of historical interest. That, surely, is a thing which should be done, a
work which should be continually maintained and developed, a work which
should as certainly be maintained at the public expense (if necessary) as
should, say, the <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i> or the <i>Dictionary of National
Biography</i>, should there ever come a time when no publisher felt able to
spare the capital required to keep those great compilations going. After
all, what is there to differentiate the cases of these enterprises from that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646</a></span>
the British Museum, which nobody, whatever his opinion about public
undertakings generally, suggests should be, or ever could be, stablished
and maintained on its present scale by private enterprise?</p>

<p>The binding-case for Vol. I. of <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span> will be ready early
in April. The case is of black cloth, with a white label in a sunk panel. It is
designed to hold the six numbers plus an eight-page index (which will also
be ready early in the month) and minus the six wrappers and the advertisement
pages. Binding-cases will be supplied from this office at 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> post free.
If readers prefer that we should bind their numbers for them, they may
send them here and pay an inclusive 6<i>s.</i>, which will cover the cost of the
case, the work of binding, and the return postage. The volume will be rather
a fat one, but we felt that readers would think that twice a year was quite
often enough to have this labour imposed on them.</p>

of the Printed Books in the British Museum, he ran about the Library
and browsed at pleasure, cultivating in his teens a taste (no doubt
inherited) not only for the best in literature, but for the best in books too. He went to
the City of London School and to Worcester College, Oxford, as a scholar; but,
to judge from his mature habits, he must have been almost completely self-educated.
A pleasant glimpse of him at Oxford may be seen in Professor Poulton's <i>Viriamu
Jones</i>. He was already a man of very wide reading; within a few years of going
down from Oxford he began to make himself known as an editor of Elizabethan drama
and anthologies. <i>Lyrics from Elizabethan Song-Books</i> and its sequels no doubt are the
most popular of his books; he rediscovered Thomas Campion, and poured out
reprints of <i>Old English Plays</i> (two series), and the works of John Day, Marlowe, Marston,
Middleton, and Peele. To edit a book, however, did not suffice him. For the last decade
of the nineteenth century the firm of Lawrence &amp; Bullen published a large number of
remarkable works, ancient and modern, including not only familiar successes like Miss
Harraden's <i>Ships that Pass in the Night</i> and Mr. W. W. Jacobs' <i>Many Cargoes</i>, half-a-dozen
of the novels of George Gissing (a close friend of Bullen's), and early works of
Mr. H. G. Wells, Moira O'Neill, and the authors of the <i>Irish R.M</i>., but also sumptuous
and beautiful books, such as Botticelli's <i>Illustrations to Dante</i>, William Strang's <i>Death
and the Ploughman's Wife</i>, and illustrated translations of Rabelais, Boccaccio, Straparola,
Masuccio, and Ser Giovanni. Bullen's special taste was shown in the "Muses' Library,"
which began with Herrick, and included Keats (with an incomparable introduction by
Robert Bridges) and William Blake (edited by W. B. Yeats).</p>

<p>Early in the present century he left the firm to continue publishing under his own
name. To this period belong the Irish Plays and <i>Ideas of Good and Evil</i> of Mr. Yeats,
whose <i>Celtic Twilight</i> and <i>Secret Rose</i> Bullen took over, with other books, from Lawrence
&amp; Bullen Ltd.; and such characteristic contributions to Elizabethan research as
Dr. W. W. Greg's edition of <i>Henslowe's Diary</i> and Mr. R. B. McKerrow's <i>Works of
Thomas Nashe</i>. In 1903 he dreamed one night that some one offered him a Shakespeare
"printed at Stratford-on-Avon"; and within a year he had started the Shakespeare
Head Press in order to realise the dream, which resulted in the "Stratford Town"
Shakespeare in ten finely-printed volumes. Settling in Stratford, he devoted himself to
printing and publishing, chiefly scholarly works of Shakespearean lore; but he also
printed the handsome Collected Edition of the works of W. B. Yeats. About 1906, in
addition to his other labours, he made a gallant effort as editor of the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> to revive its ancient glories, and managed to collect a wide variety of excellent
articles. The best memorial to Bullen would be the realisation of a scheme long planned
and fostered by him to make the Shakespeare Head Press at Stratford-on-Avon a
properly subsidised centre of British Shakespearean scholarship.</p>

<div class="figleaf"><img src="images/tb_leaf.jpg" width="164" height="14" alt="decorative break" /><br /></div>

<p>In person he bore, especially in later years, a striking resemblance to Mark Twain;
indeed, at the time of Mark's last visit to London, Bullen humorously complained of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">648</a></span>
the awkwardness of being publicly recognised as someone else. He loved tramping and
rambling&mdash;not exactly walking&mdash;whether in country or town; and as a young man had
acquired a knowledge of the high-roads and antiquities of England and Wales that was
outdone only by his extensive and peculiar knowledge of various brewages obtainable
along the road. Here is a characteristic piece of Bullen's writing&mdash;an Editorial Note in
the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> in 1906:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Sylvanus Urban, then but a boy, had started from Chepstow on a solitary walking tour,
and was soon caught in a rattling thunderstorm on the Wyndcliff. Tintern Abbey and
Raglan Castle are fresh in his memory to-day. A mile or two out of Monmouth he came upon
some excellent nutty-hearted ale that George Borrow would have immortalised. As he
pursued his way to Raglan Castle he pondered on the ale&mdash;"this way and that dividing the
swift mind"&mdash;until at length, in despair of meeting an equal brew, he turned back again
and had another tankard. Heavens, what days were those! In his pack he carried the <i>Essays
of Elia</i> and read them in an old inn at Llandovery, where the gracious hostess lighted in his
honour tall wax candles fit to stand before an altar. After leaving Llandovery, he lost his
way among the Caermarthenshire hills, and was in very poor plight with hunger and fatigue
when he reached the white-washed walls of Tregaron. At Harlech he rested for a couple of
days, and then covered the way to Beddgelert&mdash;twenty miles, if he remembers rightly&mdash;at a
spanking pace; proceeding in the late afternoon to climb Snowdon, and arriving at Llanberis
an hour or so before midnight. Back to London, every inch of the way, walked the young
Sylvanus. He indulges the hope that he may yet shoulder his pack again.</p></blockquote>

<p>He read and re-read unendingly; he loved to talk of men and books with a boon
companion, pacing to and fro, ruffling his grey mane and smoking continuously. On
such occasions he would stagger his friends with an unexpected display of familiarity
with recondite literature, or charm them with impromptu quotations, often at great
length, declaimed with a loving appreciation of sound and rhythm. Everything that was
old and ripe with goodness he loved, whether literature or furniture; in poetry above
all his instinct for the best was infallible. In English, from 1550 to his own day, he seemed
to have read and judged everything; but the atmosphere of antiquity that he breathed
shut him off from appreciating many contemporary writers. He would keep Epictetus
by his bedside, and chant Mrs. Browning's <i>Pan</i> while he dressed; he championed
Coventry Patmore and could not admire Meredith. His very craftsmanship was antique;
he could not ride a bicycle, infinitely preferring to walk; a typewriter was offensive to
one who wrote innumerable letters all in his own hand; he did not even shave himself,
finding, no doubt, a daily pleasure in visiting the barber. He was equally sound in his
judgments on mezzotints or mutton, and preferred old English fare, with beer, to
"Frenchified fuss." A chivalrous and generous scholar and gentleman; those who knew
him will call to mind the phrase in which Bullen would refer to a dead friend&mdash;"now
with God."</p>

<p>Mr. G. D. Smith, the prince of book-dealers, died suddenly in America early in the
month. He had but recently been in England, and a few days before his death was
cabling to England offers for an important library, which he had tracked down just before
leaving. It was he who purchased the famous <i>Venus and Adonis</i> for £15,100 in the winter;
he bought largely for the Huntingdon Library, and when he, or one of his millionaire
clients, really wanted a book in the English salerooms the prices might break records,
but there was no doubt about the book's destination. Mr. Smith was not, to put it mildly,
a reading man, but he had a wonderful nose for a good thing, and he was an agreeable
man to deal with&mdash;a good business man, but not one who attempted to trade unduly
upon people's ignorance.</p>

<span class="i0">Their lonely splendours and uncomprehended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dream-distance and long circlings 'mid the heights<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By spheres that spill their fire through these estranging nights:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, were they less dismaying, or less splendid!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as one deaf and mute sees the lips shape<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Night's soon-dissolving bars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Return, return? But I have never strayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hush, thoughts, that for a moment played<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Back, thoughts, from heights that freeze and deeps that burn,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In each familiar room<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with fond hands<br /></span>

<h2>THE FORESHORE OF LONDON</h2>

<p class="center">By H. M. TOMLINSON</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IT</span> begins on the north side of the City, at Poverty Corner. It begins
imperceptibly, and very likely is no more than what a native knows is
there. It does not look like a foreshore. It looks like another of the
byways of the capital. There is nothing to distinguish it from the rest of
Fenchurch Street. You will not find it in the directory, for its name is only
a familiar bearing used by seamen among themselves. If a wayfarer came
upon it from the west, he might stop to light a pipe (as well there as
anywhere) and pass on, guessing nothing of what it is and of its memories.
And why should he? London is built of such old shadows; and while we
are here casting our own there is not much time to turn and question what
they fall upon. Yet if some unreasonable doubt, a suspicion that he was
being watched, made a stranger hesitate at that corner, he might begin to
feel that London there was as different from Bayswater and Clapham as
though deep water intervened. In a sense deep water does; and not only
the sea, but legends of ships that have gone, and of the men who knew them,
and traditions of a service older than anything Whitehall knows, though still
as lively as enterprise itself, and as recent as the ships which moved on
to-day's high water.</p>

<p>In a frame outside one of its shops hangs a photograph of a sailing ship.
The portrait is so large and the beauty of the subject so evident that it might
have been the cause of the stranger stopping there to fill his pipe. Yet how
could he know that to those groups of men loitering about the name of that
ship is as familiar as Suez or Rio, even though they have never seen her?
They know her as well as they know their business. They know her house-flag&mdash;it
is indistinguishable in the picture&mdash;and her master, and it is possible
the oldest of them remembers the Clippers of that fleet of which she alone
now carries the emblem; for this is not only another year, but another era.
But they do not look at her portrait. They spit into the road, or stare across it,
and rarely move from where they stand, except to pace up and down as though
keeping a watch. At one time, perhaps thirty years ago, it was usual to see
gold rings in their ears. It is said that if you wanted a bunch of men to run a
little river steamer, with a freeboard of six inches, out to Delagoa Bay, you
could engage them all at this corner, or at the taverns just up the turning.
The suggestion of such a voyage, in such a ship, would turn us to look on
these men in wonder, for it is the way of all but the wise to expect appearance
to betray admirable qualities. These fellows, though, are not significant,
except that you might think of some of them that their ease and indifference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">664</a></span>
were assumed, and that, when trying not to look so, they were very conscious
of the haste and importance of this great city into which that corner jutted
far enough for them. They have just landed or they are about to sail again,
and they might be standing on the shore eyeing the town beyond, in which
the fate of ships is known by those they never see, but who are inimical
to them, and whose ways are inscrutable.</p>

<p>If there are any inland shops which can hold one longer than the place where
that ship's portrait hangs, then I do not know them. That comes from no
more, of course, than the usual fault of an early impression. That fault gives
a mould to the mind, and our latest thoughts, which we try to make reasonable,
betray that accidental shape. It may be said that I looked into this
window while still soft. The consequence, everybody knows, would be incurable
in a boy who saw sextants for the first time, compasses, patent logs,
sounding-machines, signalling-gear, and the other secrets of navigators.
Not only those things, either. There was a section given to books, with
classics like Stevens on <i>Stowage</i>, and Norie's <i>Navigation</i>, volumes never
seen west of Gracechurch Street. The books were all for the eyes of sailors,
and were sorted by chance. <i>Knots and Splices</i>, <i>Typee</i>, <i>Know Your Own
Ship</i>, the <i>South Pacific Directory</i>, and <i>Castaway on the Auckland Islands</i>.
There were many of them, and they were in that fortuitous and attractive
order. The back of every volume had to be read, though the light was bad.
On one wall between the windows a specimen chart was framed. Maps are
good; but how much better are charts, especially when you cannot read
them except by guessing at their cryptic lettering! About the coast line the
fathom marks cluster thickly, and venture to sea in lines which attenuate, or
become sparse clusters, till the chart is blank, being beyond soundings. At
the Capes are red dots, with arcs on the seaward side to show at what distance
mariners pick up the real lights at night. Through such windows, boys with
bills of lading and mates' receipts in their pockets, being on errands to
ship-owners, look outward, and only seem to look inward. Where are the
confines of London?</p>

<p>Opposite Poverty Corner there is, or there used to be, an archway into
a courtyard where in one old office the walls were hung with half-models
of sailing ships. I remember the name of one, the <i>Winifred</i>. Deed-boxes stood
on shelves, with the name of a ship on each. There was a mahogany counter,
an encrusted pewter inkstand, desks made secret with high screens, and a
silence that might have been the reproof to intruders of a repute remembered
in silence and dignity behind the screens by those who kept waiting so
unimportant a visitor as a boy. On the counter was a stand displaying sailing
cards, announcing, among other events in London river, "the fine ship
<i>Blackadder</i> for immediate dispatch, having most of her cargo engaged, to
Brisbane." And in those days, just round the corner in Billiter Street, one
of the East India Company's warehouses still remained, a sombre relic among
the new limestone and red granite offices, a massive archway in its centre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_665" id="Page_665">665</a></span>
leading, it could be believed, to an enclosure of night left by the eighteenth
century and forgotten. I never saw anybody go into it, nor come out. How
could they? It was of another time and place. The familiar Tower, the
Guildhall that we knew nearly as well, the Cathedral which certainly existed,
for it could often be seen in the distance, and the Abbey that was little
more than something we had heard named, they were but the scenery close
to the 'buses. Yet London was more wonderful than anything they could
make it appear. About Fenchurch Street and Leadenhall Street waggons
could be seen going east, bearing bales and cases, and the packages were
portmarked for Sourabaya, Para, Ilo-Ilo, and Santos&mdash;names like those.
They had to be seen to be believed. One could stand there, forced to think
that the sun never did more than make the floor of asphalted streets glow
like polished brass, and that the evening light was full of glittering motes and
smelt of dust, and that life worked itself out with ink in cupboards made of
glass and mahogany; and suddenly you learned, while smelling the dust,
that Acapulco was more than a portent in a book and held only by an act
of faith. Yet that astonishing revelation, enough to make any youthful
messenger forget where he himself was bound, through turning to follow
with his eyes so casual an acceptance by a carrier's cart of the verity of a
fable, is nowhere mentioned, I have found since, in any guide to our capital,
though you may learn how Cornhill got its name.</p>

<p>For though Londoners understand the Guildhall pigeons have as much
right to the place as the Aldermen, they look upon the seabirds by London
Bridge as vagrant strangers. They do not know where their city ends on the
east side. Their river descends from Oxford in more than one sense, and
ceases to lose their respect in the neighbourhood of Westminster. It has
little history worth mentioning below that. To the poets the river fails them,
it becomes flat and songless where at Richmond the sea's remote influence
just moves it; and there they leave it. The Thames goes down then to a wide
grey vacuity, a featureless monotony where men but toil, where life becomes
silent in effort, and goes out through fogs to nowhere in particular. But
there is a hilltop at Woolwich from which, better than from Richmond, our
river, the burden-bearer, the road which joins us to New York and Sydney,
can be seen for what it is, plainly related to a vaster world, with the
ships upon its bright path moving through the smoke and buildings of the
City. And surely some surmise of what our river is comes to a few of that
multitude which crosses London Bridge every day? They favour the east
side of it, I have noticed, and they cannot always resist a pause to stare
overside to the Pool. Why do they? Ships are there, it is true, but
only insignificant traders, diminished by sombre cliffs up which their cargo
is hauled piecemeal to vanish instantly into mid-air caverns; London
absorbs all they have as morsels. Anyhow, it is the business of ships. The
people on the bridge watch another life below, with its strange cries and
mysterious movements. A leisurely wisp of steam rises from a steamer's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">666</a></span>
funnel. She is alive and breathing, though motionless. The walls enclosing
the Pool are spectral in a winter light, and might be no more than
the almost forgotten memory of a dark past. Looking at them intently,
to give them a name, the wayfarer on the bridge could imagine they were
maintained there only by the frail effort of his will. Once they were, but
now, in some moods, they are merely remembered. Only the men busy
on the deck of the ship below are real. Through an arch beneath the feet a
barge shoots out noiselessly on the ebb, and staring down at its sudden
apparition you feel dizzily that it has the bridge in tow and that all you
people there are being drawn down resistlessly into that lower world of
shades. You release yourself from this spell with an effort and look at the
faces of those who are beside you at the parapet. What are their thoughts?
Do they know? Have they also seen the ghosts? Have they felt stirring a
secret and forgotten desire, old memories, and tales that were told? They
move away and go to their desks, or to their homes in the suburbs. A vessel
that has hauled into the fairway calls for the Tower Bridge gates to be
opened for her. She is going. We watch the eastern mists which take her
from us. For we never are so passive and well disciplined to the routine of
the things which compel us, but rebellion comes at times&mdash;misgiving that
there is a world beyond the one we know, regret that we never ventured
and made no discovery, and that our time has been saved and not spent.
The bascules descend again.</p>

<p>There, where that ship vanished, is the highway which brought those
unknown folk whose need created London out of reeds and mere. It is our
oldest road, and now has many by-paths. Near Poverty Corner is a building
which recently was dismissed with a brief humorous reference in a new
guide to our City&mdash;a cobbled forecourt, tame pigeons, cabs, a brick-front
topped by a clock-face: Fenchurch Street Station. Beyond its dingy platforms,
the metal track which contracts into the murk is the road to China,
though that is, perhaps, the last place you would guess to be at the end of it.
The train runs over a wilderness of tiles, a grey plateau of bare slate and rock, its
expanse cracked and scored as though by a withering heat. Nothing grows there;
nothing could live there. Smoke still pours from it, as though it were volcanic,
from numberless vents. The region is without sap. Above its plains project
superior fumaroles, their drifting vapours dissolving great areas. When the
train descends slightly, then holes appear in that cliff which runs parallel
with your track. The desert is actually burrowed, and every hole in the
plateau is a habitation. Something does live there. That region of burnt
and fissured rock is tunnelled and inhabited; the unlikely serrations and
ridges with the smoke moving over them are porous, and a fluid life
ranges beneath unseen. It is the beginning of Dockland. That the life is in
upright beings, each with independent volition and a soul; that it is not
an amorphous movement, flowing in bulk through buried pipes, incapable
of the idea of height, of rising, is difficult to believe. It has not been believed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">667</a></span>
If life, you protest, is really there, has any sense which is better than that of
extending worm-like through the underground, then why, at intervals, is
there not an upheaval, a geyser-like burst, a plain hint from a power usually
pent, but liable to go skywards? But that is for the desert to answer. As
by mocking chance the desert itself almost instantly shows what possibilities
are hidden within it. The train roars unexpectedly over a viaduct, and below
is a deep hollow filled with light, with a floor of water, and a surprise of ships.
How did that white schooner get into such an enclosure? Is freedom
nearer here than we thought?</p>

<p>The crust of roofs ends abruptly in a country which is a complexity of
gasometers, canals, railway junctions, between which the long spokes of
cabbage-fields radiate from the train and revolve, and what is the grotesque
suggestion of many ships in the distance, for through gaps in a nondescript
horizon masts appear in a kaleidoscopic way. The journey ends,
usually in the rain, among iron sheds that are topped on the far side by
the rigging and smoke-stacks of great liners. There is no doubt about it
now. At the corner of one shed, sheltering from the weather, is a group of
brown men in coloured rags, first seen in the gloom because of the whites
of their eyes. What we remember of such a day is that it was half of night,
and the wind played castanets with the sheet iron, hummed in the cordage,
and swayed wildly the loose gear aloft. Towering hulls were ranged
down each side of a lagoon that ended in vacancy. The rigging and funnels
of the fleet were unrelated; those ships were phantom and monstrous.
They seemed on too great a scale to be within human control. We felt
diminished and a little fearful, as among the looming urgencies of a dream.
The forms were gigantic but vague, and they were seen in a smother of
the elements; and their sounds, sonorous, melancholy, and prolonged,
were like the warning of something alien, yet without form, which we knew
was adverse, but could not recall when awake again. We remember, that day,
a few watchers insecure on an exposed dockhead that projected into a sullen
dreariness of river and mud which could have been the finish of the land.
At the end of a creaking hawser was a steamer canting as she backed to
head down stream&mdash;she was obviously exposed now to a great adventure&mdash;the
tide, rapid and noisy on her plates, the reek from her funnel sinking
over the water. And from the dockhead, in the fuddle of a rain-squall, we
were waving a handkerchief, probably to the wrong man, till the vessel went
out where all was one, rain, river, mud, and sky, and the future.</p>

<p>It is afterwards that so strange an ending to a brief journey from a city
station is seen to have had more in it than the time-table, hurriedly scanned,
gave away. Or it would be remembered as strange, if the one who had to
make that journey so much as thought of it again; for perhaps to a stranger
occupied with more important matters it was passed as being quite relevant
to the occasion, ordinary and rather dismal, the usual boredom of a duty.
Its strangeness depends, very likely, as much on an idle and squandering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">668</a></span>
mind as on the ships, the river, and the gasometers. Yet suppose you
first saw the river from Blackwall Stairs, in the days when the windows
of the Artichoke Tavern, an ancient weather-boarded house with benches
outside, still looked towards the ships coming in! And how if then, one
evening, you had seen a Blackwall liner haul out for the Antipodes while
her crew sang a chanty! It might put another light on the river; but a light,
I will admit, which others should not be expected to see, and if they looked
for it now might not discover, for it is possible that it has vanished, like
the old tavern. It is easy to persuade ourselves that a matter is made plain
by the light in which we prefer to see it, for it is our light. One day, I remember,
a boy had to take a sheaf of documents to a vessel loading in the London
Dock. She was sailing that tide. It was a hot July noon. It is unlucky to send
a boy, who is marked by all the omens for a city prisoner, to that dock, for
it is one of the best of its kind. He had not been there before. There was an
astonishing vista, once inside the gates, of sherry butts and port casks.
On the flagstones were pools of wine lees. There was an unforgettable smell.
It was of wine, spices, oakum, wool, and hides. The sun made it worse, but
the boy, I think, preferred it strong. After wandering along many old quays,
and through dark sheds with wide doors that, on such a sunny day, were
stored with cool night and cubes and planks of gold, he found his ship,
the <i>Mulatto Girl</i>. She was for the Brazils. Now it is clear that one even wiser
in shipping affairs than a boy would have expected to see a craft that was
haughty and portentous when bound for the Brazils, a ship that looked
equal to making a coast of that kind. There she was, her flush deck well
below the quay wall. A ladder went down to her, for she was no more than
a schooner of a little over 100 tons. If that did not look like the beginning
of one of those voyages that are reputed to have ended with the Elizabethans,
then I am trying to convey a wrong impression. On the deck of the <i>Mulatto
Girl</i> was her master, in shirt and trousers and a remarkable straw hat more
like a canopy, bending over to discharge some weighty words into the
hatch. He rose and looked up at the boy on the quay, showing then a taut
black beard and formidable eyes. With his hands on his hips, he surveyed
for a few seconds the messenger above without speaking. Then he talked
business, and more than legitimate business. "Do you want to come?"
he asked, and smiled. "Eh?" He stroked his beard. The Brazils and all!
A ship like that! "There's a berth for you. Come along, my son." And
observe what we may lose through that habit of ours of uncritical obedience
to duty; see what may leave us for ever in that fatal pause, caused by the
surprise of the challenge to our narrow experience and knowledge, the
pause in which we miserably allow habit to overcome adventurous instinct!
I never heard again of the <i>Mulatto Girl</i>. I could not expect to. Something,
though, was gained that day. It cannot be named. It is of no value. It is,
you may have guessed, that very light which it has been admitted may since
have gone out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">669</a></span>
Well, nobody who has ever surprised that light in Dockland will be
persuaded that it is not there still, and will remain. What the foreshore of
London is to some of us, and what those lights are which we see as reflections
coming down the waters from a far adventure, to others would be
what they are. The foreshore to them is the unending monotony of grey streets,
sometimes grim, often decayed, and always reticent and sullen, that might
never have seen the stars or heard of good luck; and the light would be,
when closely looked at, merely a high gas bracket on a dank brick wall in
solitude, its glass broken, and the flame within it fluttering to extinction
like an imprisoned and crippled moth trying to evade the squeeze of giant
darkness and the wind. The narrow and forbidden by-way under that glim, a
path intermittent, and depending on the weight of the night which is trying
to blot it out altogether, goes to Wapping Old Stairs. Prince Rupert once
went that way. The ketch <i>Nonsuch</i>, Captain Zachary Gillam, was then lying
just off, about to make the voyage which established the Hudson's Bay
Company.</p>

<p>It is a path, like all those stairs and ways that go down to the river, which
began when human footsteps first originated London with rough tracks.
It is a path by which the successors of those primitives went out of London,
when projecting the original enterprise of their ancestors from Wapping to the
Guinea Coast and Manitoba. Why should we believe it is different to-day?
The sea does not change, and seamen are what they were, if their ships are
not those we admired many years ago in the India Docks. It is impossible
for those who know them to see those moody streets of Dockland, indeterminate,
for they follow the river, which run from Tooley Street by the
Hole-in-the-Wall to the Deptford Docks, and from Tower Hill along
Wapping High Street to Limehouse and the Isle of Dogs, as strangers would
see them. What could they be to strangers? Mud, taverns, pawnshops,
neglected and obscure churches, and houses that might know nothing but
ill-fortune.</p>

<p>So they are; but those ways hold more than the visible shades. The
warehouses of that meandering chasm which is Wapping High Street are like
weathered and unequal cliffs. It is hard to believe sunlight ever falls there.
It could not get down. It is not easy to believe the river is near. It seldom
shows. You think at times you hear the distant call of a ship. But what
would that be? Something in the mind. It happened long ago. You, too,
are a ghost left by the vanished past. There is a man above at a high loophole,
the topmost cave of a warehouse which you can see has been exposed
to commerce and the elements for ages; he pulls in a bale pendulous from
the cable of a derrick. Below him one of the horses of a van tosses its nosebag.
There is no other movement. A carman leans against an iron post,
and cuts bread and cheese with a clasp knife. It was curious to hear that
steamer call, but we know what it was. It was from a ship that went down,
we have lately heard, in the war, and her spectre reminds us, from a voyage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">670</a></span>
which is over, of men who have gone. But the call comes again just where
the Stairs, like a shining wedge of day, holds the black warehouses asunder,
and shows the light of the river and a release to the outer world. And there,
moving swiftly across the brightness, goes a steamer outward bound.</p>

<p>That was what we wanted to know. She confirms it, and her signal, to
whomever it was made, carries farther than she would guess. It is understood.
The past for some of us now is our only populous and habitable
world, invisible to others, but alive with whispers for us. Yet the sea still
moves daily along the old foreshore, and ships still go and come, and do not,
like us, run aground on what now is not there.</p>

to loom up before me like a tangible and resounding organism; I want him,
when I read him in my room, to reveal to me, from the characters that
shimmer before my eyes, a spirit that enters into me and seems to ascend
within me from out of his pages.</p>

<p>I love the prose that comes rolling up from the infinity of the artist's soul,

<h2>HENRY JAMES</h2>

<p class="center">By EDMUND GOSSE, C.B.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">VOLUMINOUS</span> as had been the writings of Henry <span class="locked">James<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> since
1875, it was not until he approached the end of his career that he
began to throw any light on the practical events and social
adventures of his own life. He had occasionally shown that he
could turn from the psychology of imaginary characters to the record of real
lives without losing any part of his delicate penetration or his charm of
portraiture. He had, in particular, written the <i>Life of Hawthorne</i> in 1879,
between <i>Daisy Miller</i> and <i>An International Episode</i>; and again in 1903, at
the height of his latest period, he had produced a specimen of that period
in his elusive and parenthetical but very beautiful so-called <i>Life of W. W.
Story</i>. But these biographies threw no more light upon his own adventures
than did his successive volumes of critical and topographical essays, in
which the reader may seek long before he detects the sparkle of a crumb of
personal fact. Henry James, at the age of seventy, had not begun to reveal
himself behind the mask which spoke in the tones of a world of imaginary
characters.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31" id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Messrs. Macmillan are about to publish Mr. Lubbock's edition of James's Letters.</p></div>

<p>So saying, I do not forget that in the general edition of his collected, or
rather selected, novels and tales, published from 1908 onwards, Henry James
prefixed to each volume an introduction which assumed to be wholly
biographical. He yielded, he said, "to the pleasure of placing on record the
circumstances" in which each successive tale was written. I well recollect
the terms in which he spoke of these prefaces before he began to write them.
They were to be full and confidential, they were to throw to the winds all
restraints of conventional reticence, they were to take us, with eyes
unbandaged, into the inmost sanctum of his soul. They appeared at last, in
small print, and they were extremely extensive, but truth obliges me to say
that I found them highly disappointing. Constitutionally fitted to take
pleasure in the accent of almost everything that Henry James ever wrote, I
have to confess that these prefaces constantly baffle my eagerness. Not for a
moment would I deny that they throw interesting light on the technical
craft of a self-respecting novelist, but they are dry, remote, and impersonal
to a strange degree. It is as though the author felt a burning desire to confide
in the reader, whom he positively button-holes in the endeavour, but that
the experience itself evades him, fails to find expression, and falls still-born,
while other matters, less personal and less important, press in and take their
place against the author's wish. Henry James proposed, in each instance, to
disclose "the contributive value of the accessory facts in a given artistic
case." This is, indeed, what we require in the history or the autobiography<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">674</a></span>
of an artist, whether painter or musician or man of letters. But this includes
the production of anecdotes, of salient facts, of direct historical statements,
which Henry James seemed in 1908 to be completely incapacitated from
giving, so that really, in the introductions to some of these novels in the
Collected Edition, it is difficult to know what the beloved novelist is
endeavouring to divulge. He becomes almost chimæra bombinating in a
vacuum.</p>

<p>Had we lost him soon after the appearance of the latest of these prefaces&mdash;that
prefixed to <i>The Golden Bowl</i>, in which the effort to reveal something
which is not revealed amounts almost to an agony&mdash;it would have been
impossible to reconstruct the life of Henry James by the closest examination
of his published writings. Ingenious commentators would have pieced
together conjectures from such tales as <i>The Altar of the Dead</i> and <i>The Lesson
of the Master</i>, and have insisted, more or less plausibly, on their accordance
with what the author <i>must</i> have thought or done, endured or attempted.
But, after all, these would have been "conjectures," not more definitely
based than what bold spirits use when they construct lives of Shakespeare,
or, for that matter, of Homer. Fortunately, in 1913, the desire to place some
particulars of the career of his marvellous brother William in the setting of
his "immediate native and domestic air," led Henry James to contemplate,
with minuteness, the fading memories of his own childhood. Starting with
a biographical study of William James, he found it impossible to treat the
family development at all adequately without extending the survey to his
own growth as well, and thus, at the age of seventy, Henry became for the
first time, and almost unconsciously, an autobiographer.</p>

<p>He had completed two large volumes of <i>Memories</i>, and was deep in a
third, when death took him from us. <i>A Small Boy and Others</i> deals with such
extreme discursiveness as is suitable in a collection of the fleeting impressions
of infancy, from his birth in 1843 to his all but fatal attack of typhus
fever at Boulogne-sur-Mer in (perhaps) 1857. I say "perhaps" because the
wanton evasion of any sort of help in the way of dates is characteristic of the
narrative, as it would be of childish memories. The next instalment was
<i>Notes of a Son and Brother</i>, which opens in 1860, a doubtful period of three
years being leaped over lightly, and closes&mdash;as I guess from an allusion to
George Eliot's <i>Spanish Gypsy</i>&mdash;in 1868. The third instalment, dictated in
the autumn of 1914 and laid aside unfinished, is the posthumous <i>The Middle
Years</i>, faultlessly edited by the piety of Mr. Percy Lubbock in 1917. Here
the tale is taken up in 1869, and is occupied, without much attempt at
chronological order, with memories of two years in London. As Henry
James did not revise, or perhaps even re-read, these pages, we are free to
form our conclusion as to whether he would or would not have vouchsafed
to put their disjected parts into some more anatomical order.</p>

<p>Probably he would not have done so. The tendency of his genius had
never been, and at the end was less than ever, in the direction of concinnity.
He repudiated arrangement, he wilfully neglected the precise adjustment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">675</a></span>
parts. The three autobiographical volumes will always be documents precious
in the eyes of his admirers. They are full of beauty and nobility, they exhibit
with delicacy, and sometimes even with splendour, the qualities of his
character. But it would be absurd to speak of them as easy to read, or as
fulfilling what is demanded from an ordinary biographer. They have the
tone of Veronese, but nothing of his definition. A broad canvas is spread
before us, containing many figures in social conjuncture. But the plot, the
single "story" which is being told, is drowned in misty radiance. Out of
this <i>chiaroscuro</i> there leap suddenly to our vision a sumptuous head and
throat, a handful of roses, the glitter of a satin sleeve, but it is only when we
shut our eyes and think over what we have looked at that any coherent plan
is revealed to us, or that we detect any species of composition. It is a case
which calls for editorial help, and I hope that when the three fragments of
autobiography are reprinted as a single composition, no prudery of hesitation
to touch the sacred ark will prevent the editor from prefixing a skeleton
chronicle of actual dates and facts. It will take nothing from the dignity of the
luminous reveries in their original shape.</p>

<p>Such a skeleton will tell us that Henry James was born at 2 Washington
Place, New York, on April 15th, 1843, and that he was the second child of
his parents, the elder by one year being William, who grew up to be the most
eminent philosopher whom America has produced. Their father, Henry
James the elder, was himself a philosopher, whose ideas, which the younger
Henry frankly admitted to be beyond his grasp, were expounded by William
James in 1884, in a preface to their father's posthumous papers. Henry was
only one year old when the family paid a long visit to Paris, but his earliest
recollections were of Albany, whence the Jameses migrated to New York
until 1855. They then transferred their home to Europe for three years,
during which time the child Henry imbibed what he afterwards called
"the European virus." In 1855 he was sent to Geneva for purposes of education,
which were soon abandoned, and the whole family began an aimless
wandering through London, Paris, Boulogne-sur-Mer, Newport, Geneva, and
America again, nothing but the Civil War sufficing to root this fugitive
household in one abiding home.</p>

<p>Henry James's health forced him to be a spectator of the war, in which his
younger brothers fought. He went to Harvard in 1862 to study law, but was
now beginning to feel a more and more irresistible call to take up letters as a
profession, and the Harvard Law School left little or no direct impression
upon him. He formed a close and valuable friendship with Mr. Howells,
seven years his senior, and the pages of the <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, of which
Mr. Howells was then assistant editor, were open to him from 1865. He
lived for the next four years in very poor health, and with no great encouragement
from himself or others, always excepting Mr. Howells, at Cambridge,
Massachusetts. Early in 1869 he ventured to return to Europe, where he
spent fifteen months in elegant but fruitful vagabondage. There was much
literary work done, most of which he carefully suppressed in later life. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">676</a></span>
reader will, however, discover, tucked away in the thirteenth volume of the
Collected Edition, a single waif from this rejected epoch, the tale called
<i>A Passionate Pilgrim</i>, written on his return to America in 1870. This visit to
Europe absolutely determined his situation; his arrival in New York stimulated
and tortured his nostalgia for the old world, and in May, 1872, he flew
back here once more to the European enchantment.</p>

<p>Here, practically, the biographical information respecting Henry James
which has hitherto been given to the world ceases, for the fragment of <i>The
Middle Years</i>, so far as can be gathered, contains few recollections which can
be dated later than his thirtieth year. It was said of Marivaux that he cultivated
no faculty but that <i>de ne vivre que pour voir et pour entendre</i>. In a
similar spirit Henry James took up his dwelling in fashionable London
lodgings in March, 1869. He had come from America with the settled design
of making a profound study of English manners, and there were two aspects
of the subject which stood out for him above all others. One of these was the
rural beauty of ancient country places, the other was the magnitude&mdash;"the
inconceivable immensity," as he put it&mdash;of London. He told his sister, "The
place sits on you, broods on you, stamps on you with the feet of its myriad
bipeds and quadrupeds." From his lodgings in Half Moon Street, quiet
enough in themselves, he had the turmoil of the West End at his elbow,
Piccadilly, Park Lane, St. James's Street, all within the range of a five
minutes' stroll. He plunged into the vortex with incredible gusto, "knocking
about in a quiet way and deeply enjoying my little adventures." This was
his first mature experience of London, of which he remained until the end of
his life perhaps the most infatuated student, the most "passionate pilgrim"
that America has ever sent us.</p>

<p>But his health was still poor, and for his constitution's sake he went in the
summer of 1869 to Great Malvern. He went alone, and it is to be remarked
of him that, social as he was, and inclined to a deep indulgence in the company
of his friends, his habit of life was always in the main a solitary one. He had
no constant associates, and he did not shrink from long periods of isolation,
which he spent in reading and writing, but also in a concentrated contemplation
of the passing scene, whatever it might be. It was alone that he now
made a tour of the principal English cathedral and university towns, expatiating
to himself on the perfection of the weather&mdash;"the dozen exquisite days
of the English year, days stamped with a purity unknown in climates where
fine weather is cheap." It was alone that he made acquaintance with Oxford,
of which city he became at once the impassioned lover which he continued to
be to the end, raving from Boston in 1870 of the supreme gratifications of
Oxford as "the most dignified and most educated" of the cradles of our race.
It was alone that during these enchanting weeks he made himself acquainted
with the unimagined loveliness of English hamlets buried in immemorial
leafage and whispered to by meandering rivulets in the warm recesses of
antiquity. These, too, found in Henry James a worshipper more ardent, it may
almost be averred, than any other who had crossed the Atlantic to their shrine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">677</a></span>
Having formed this basis for the main predilection of his English studies,
Henry James passed over to the Continent, and conducted a similar pilgrimage
of entranced obsession through Switzerland and Italy. His wanderings,
"rapturous and solitary," were, as in England, hampered by no social
engagement; "I see no people to speak of," he wrote, "or for that matter
to speak to." He returned to America in April, 1870, at the close of a year
which proved critical in his career, and which laid its stamp on the whole of
his future work. He had been kindly received in artistic and literary circles
in London; he had conversed with Ruskin, with William Morris, with
Aubrey de Vere, but it is plain that while he observed the peculiarities of
these eminent men with the closest avidity, he made no impression whatever
upon them. The time for Henry James to "make an impression" on others
was not come yet; he was simply the well-bred, rather shy, young American
invalid, with excellent introductions, who crossed the path of English
activities, almost without casting a shadow. He had published no book; he
had no distinct calling; he was a deprecating and punctilious young stranger
from somewhere in Massachusetts, immature-looking for all his seven-and-twenty
years.</p>

<p>Some further uneventful seasons, mainly spent in America but diversified
by tours in Germany and Italy, bring us to 1875, when Henry James came
over from Cambridge with the definite project, at last, of staying in Europe
"for good." He took rooms in Paris, at 29 Rue de Luxembourg, and he
penetrated easily into the very exclusive literary society which at that time
revolved around Flaubert and Edmond de Goncourt. This year in Paris was
another highly critical period in Henry James's intellectual history. He was
still, at the mature age of thirty-two, almost an amateur in literature, having
been content, up to that time, to produce scarcely anything which his mature
taste did not afterwards repudiate. <i>The Passionate Pilgrim</i> (1870), of which
I have spoken above, is the only waif and stray of the pre-1873 years which
he has permitted to survive. The first edition of this short story is now not
easy of reference, and I have not seen it; the reprint of 1908 is obviously, and
is doubtless vigorously, re-handled. Enough, however, remains of what must
be original to show that, in a rather crude, and indeed almost hysterical
form, the qualities of Henry James's genius were, in 1869, what they continued
to be in 1909. He has conquered, however, in <i>A Passionate Pilgrim</i>,
no command yet over his enthusiasm, his delicate sense of beauty, his apprehension
of the exquisite colour of antiquity.</p>

<p>From the French associates of this time he derived practical help in
his profession, though without their being aware of what they gave
him. He was warmly attracted to Gustave Flaubert, who had just published
<i>La Tentation de St. Antoine</i>, a dazzled admiration of which was the excuse
which threw the young American at the feet of the Rouen giant. This particular
admiration dwindled with the passage of time, but Henry James
continued faithful to the author of <i>Madame Bovary</i>. It was Turgenev who
introduced him to Flaubert, from whom he passed to Guy de Maupassant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">678</a></span>
then an athlete of four-and-twenty, and still scintillating in that blaze of
juvenile virility which always fascinated Henry James. In the train of Edmond
de Goncourt came Zola, vociferous over his late tribulation of having
<i>L'Assommoir</i> stopped in its serial issue; Alphonse Daudet, whose recent
<i>Jack</i> was exercising over tens of thousands of readers the tyranny of tears;
and François Coppée, the almost exact coeval of Henry James, and now
author of a <i>Luthier de Cremone</i>, which had placed him high among French
poets. That the young American, with no apparent claim to attention except
the laborious perfection of his French speech, was welcomed and ultimately
received on terms of intimacy in this the most exclusive of European intellectual
circles is curious. Henry James was accustomed to deprecate the
notion that these Frenchmen took the least interest in him: "they have
never read a line of me, they have never even persuaded themselves that
there was a line of me which anyone could read," he once said to me. How
should they, poor charming creatures, in their self-sufficing Latin intensity,
know what or whether some barbarian had remotely "written"? But this
does not end the marvel, because, read or not read, there was Henry James
among them, affectionately welcomed, talked to familiarly about "technique,"
and even about "sales," like a fellow-craftsman. There must evidently have
developed by this time something modestly "impressive" about him, and I
cannot doubt that these Parisian masters of language more or less dimly divined
that he too was, in some medium not by them to be penetrated, a master.</p>

<p>After this fruitful year in Paris, the first result of which was the publication
in London of his earliest surviving novel, <i>Roderick Hudson</i>, and the completion
of <i>The American</i>, Henry James left his "glittering, charming, civilised Paris"
and settled in London. He submitted himself, as he wrote to his brother
William in 1878, "without reserve to that Londonising process of which the
effect is to convince you that, having lived here, you may, if need be, abjure
civilisation and bury yourself in the country, but may not, in pursuit of civilisation,
live in any smaller town." He plunged deeply into the study of London,
externally and socially, and into the production of literature, in which he was
now as steadily active as he was elegantly proficient. These novels of his
earliest period have neither the profundity nor the originality of those of his
middle and final periods, but they have an exquisite freshness of their own,
and a workmanship the lucidity and logic of which he owed in no small
measure to his conversations with Daudet and Maupassant, and to his, at
that time almost exclusive, reading of the finest French fiction. He published
<i>The American</i> in 1877, <i>The Europeans</i> and <i>Daisy Miller</i> in 1878, and <i>An
International Episode</i> in 1879. He might advance in stature and breadth; he
might come to disdain the exiguous beauty of these comparatively juvenile
books, but now at all events were clearly revealed all the qualities which were
to develop later, and to make Henry James unique among writers of Anglo-Saxon
race.</p>

<p>His welcome into English society was remarkable if we reflect that he
seemed to have little to give in return for what it offered except his social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">679</a></span>
adaptability, his pleasant and still formal amenity, and his admirable capacity
for listening. It cannot be repeated too clearly that the Henry James of those
early days had very little of the impressiveness of his later manner. He went
everywhere, sedately, watchfully, graciously, but never prominently. In the
winter of 1878-79 it is recorded that he dined out in London 107 times, but
it is highly questionable whether this amazing assiduity at the best dinner-tables
will be found to have impressed itself on any Greville or Crabb
Robinson who was taking notes at the time. He was strenuously living up
to his standard, "my charming little standard of wit, of grace, of good
manners, of vivacity, of urbanity, of intelligence, of what makes an easy and
natural style of intercourse." He was watching the rather gross and unironic,
but honest and vigorous, English upper-middle-class of that day with mingled
feelings, in which curiosity and a sort of remote sympathy took a main part.
At 107 London dinners he observed the ever-shifting pieces of the general
kaleidoscope with tremendous acuteness, and although he thought their
reds and yellows would have been improved by a slight infusion of the
Florentine harmony, on the whole he was never weary of watching their
evolutions. In this way the years slipped by, while he made a thousand
acquaintances and a dozen durable friendships. It is a matter of pride and
happiness to me that I am able to touch on one of the latter.</p>

<p>It is often curiously difficult for intimate friends, who have the impression
in later years that they must always have known one another, to recall the
occasion and the place where they first met. That was the case with Henry
James and me. Several times we languidly tried to recover those particulars,
but without success. I think, however, that it was at some dinner-party that
we first met, and as the incident is dubiously connected with the publication
of the <i>Hawthorne</i> in 1879, and with Mr. (now Lord) Morley, whom we both
frequently saw at that epoch, I am pretty sure that the event took place early
in 1880. The acquaintance, however, did not "ripen," as people say, until
the summer of 1882, when in connection with an article on the drawings of
George du Maurier, which I was anxious Henry James should write&mdash;having
heard him express himself with high enthusiasm regarding these
works of art&mdash;he invited me to go to see him and to talk over the project.
I found him, one sunshiny afternoon, in his lodgings on the first floor of
No. 3 Bolton Street, at the Piccadilly end of the street, where the houses
look askew into Green Park. Here he had been living ever since he came
over from France in 1876, and the situation was eminently characteristic
of the impassioned student of London life and haunter of London society
which he had now become.</p>

<p>Stretched on the sofa and apologising for not rising to greet me, his
appearance gave me a little shock, for I had not thought of him as an invalid.
He hurriedly and rather evasively declared that he was not that, but that
a muscular weakness of his spine obliged him, as he said, "to assume the
horizontal posture" during some hours of every day in order to bear
the almost unbroken routine of evening engagements. I think that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">680</a></span>
weakness gradually passed away, but certainly for many years it handicapped
his activity. I recall his appearance, seen then for the first time by daylight;
there was something shadowy about it, the face framed in dark brown hair
cut short in the Paris fashion, and in equally dark beard, rather loose and
"fluffy." He was in deep mourning, his mother having died five or six
months earlier, and he himself having but recently returned from a melancholy
visit to America, where he had unwillingly left his father, who seemed
far from well. His manner was grave, extremely courteous, but a little
formal and frightened, which seemed strange in a man living in constant
communication with the world. Our business regarding Du Maurier was soon
concluded, and James talked with increasing ease, but always with a
punctilious hesitancy, about Paris, where he seemed, to my dazzlement, to
know even a larger number of persons of distinction than he did in London.</p>

<p>He promised, before I left, to return my visit, but news of the alarming
illness of his father called him suddenly to America. He wrote to me from
Boston in April, 1883, but he did not return to London until the autumn
that year. Our intercourse was then resumed, and, immediately, on the
familiar footing which it preserved, without an hour's abatement, until the
sad moment of his fatal illness. When he returned to Bolton Street&mdash;this
was in August, 1883&mdash;he had broken all the ties which held him to residence
in America, a country which, as it turned out, he was not destined to revisit
for more than twenty years. By this means Henry James became a homeless
man in a peculiar sense, for he continued to be looked upon as a foreigner
in London, while he seemed to have lost citizenship in the United States.
It was a little later than this that that somewhat acidulated patriot, Colonel
Higginson, in reply to some one who said that Henry James was a cosmopolitan,
remarked, "Hardly! for a cosmopolitan is at home even in his own
country!" This condition made James, although superficially gregarious,
essentially isolated, and though his books were numerous and were greatly
admired, they were tacitly ignored alike in summaries of English and of
American current literature. There was no escape from this dilemma. Henry
James was equally determined not to lay down his American birthright and
not to reside in America. Every year of his exile, therefore, emphasised the
fact of his separation from all other Anglo-Saxons, and he endured, in the
world of letters, the singular fate of being a man without a country.</p>

<p>The collection of his private letters, therefore, which is announced as
immediately forthcoming under the sympathetic editorship of Mr. Percy
Lubbock, will reveal the adventures of an author who, long excluded from
two literatures, is now eagerly claimed by both of them, and it will display
those movements of a character of great energy and singular originality
which circumstances have hitherto concealed from curiosity. There was
very little on the surface of his existence to bear evidence to the passionate
intensity of the stream beneath. This those who have had the privilege of
seeing his letters know is marvellously revealed in his private correspondence.
A certain change in his life was brought about by the arrival in 1885 of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">681</a></span>
sister Alice, who, in now confirmed ill-health, was persuaded to make
Bournemouth and afterwards Leamington her home. He could not share her
life, but at all events he could assiduously diversify it by his visits, and
Bournemouth had a second attraction for him in the presence of Robert
Louis Stevenson, with whom he had by this time formed one of the closest of
his friendships. Stevenson's side of the correspondence has long been
known, and it is one of the main attractions which Mr. Lubbock holds out
to his readers that Henry James's letters to Stevenson will now be published.
No episode of the literary history of the time is more fascinating than the
interchange of feeling between these two great artists. The death of Stevenson,
nine years later than their first meeting, though long anticipated, fell
upon Henry James with a shock which he found at first scarcely endurable.
For a long time afterwards he could not bring himself to mention the name
of R. L. S. without a distressing agitation.</p>

<p>In 1886 the publication of <i>The Bostonians</i>, a novel which showed an
advance in direct or, as it was then styled, "realistic" painting of modern
society, increased the cleft which now divided him from his native country,
for <i>The Bostonians</i> was angrily regarded as satirising not merely certain
types, but certain recognisable figures in Massachusetts, and that with a
suggestive daring which was unusual. Henry James, intent upon making a
vivid picture, and already perhaps a little out of touch with American
sentiment, was indignant at the reception of this book, which he ultimately,
to my great disappointment, omitted from his Collected Edition, for reasons
which he gave in a long letter to myself. Hence, as his works now appear,
<i>The Princess Casamassima</i>, of 1886, an essentially London adventure-story,
takes its place as the earliest of the novels of his second period, although
preceded by admirable short tales in that manner, the most characteristic of
which is doubtless <i>The Author of Beltraffio</i> (1885). This exemplifies the custom
he had now adopted of seizing an incident reported to him, often a very
slight and bald affair, and weaving round it a thick and glittering web of
silken fancy, just as the worm winds round the unsightly chrysalis its graceful
robe of gold. I speak of <i>The Author of Beltraffio</i>, and after thirty-five years I
may confess that this extraordinarily vivid story was woven around a dark
incident in the private life of an eminent author known to us both, which I,
having told Henry James in a moment of levity, was presently horrified and
even sensibly alarmed to see thus pinnacled in the broad light of day.</p>

<p>After exhausting at last the not very shining amenities of his lodgings in
Bolton Street, where all was old and dingy, he went westward in 1886 into
Kensington, and settled in a flat which was both new and bright, at 34 De
Vere Gardens, Kensington, where he began a novel called <i>The Tragic
Muse</i>, on which he expended an immense amount of pains. He was greatly
wearied by the effort, and not entirely satisfied with the result. He determined,
as he said, "to do nothing but short lengths" for the future, and he
devoted himself to the execution of <i>contes</i>. But even the art of the short
story presently yielded to a new and, it must be confessed, a deleterious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">682</a></span>
fascination, that of the stage. He was disappointed&mdash;he made no secret to
his friends of his disillusion&mdash;in the commercial success of his novels, which
was inadequate to his needs. I believe that he greatly over-estimated these
needs, and that at no time he was really pressed by the want of money. But
he thought that he was, and in his anxiety he turned to the theatre as a
market in which to earn a fortune. Little has hitherto been revealed with
regard to this "sawdust and orange-peel phase" (as he called it) in Henry
James's career, but it cannot be ignored any longer. The memories of his
intimate friends are stored with its incidents, his letters will be found to be
full of it.</p>

<p>Henry James wrote, between 1889 and 1894, seven or eight plays, on each
of which he expended an infinitude of pains and mental distress. At the end
of this period, unwillingly persuaded at last that all his agony was in vain,
and that he could never secure fame and fortune, or even a patient hearing
from the theatre-going public by his dramatic work, he abandoned the
hopeless struggle. He was by temperament little fitted to endure the disappointments
and delays which must always attend the course of a dramatist
who has not conquered a position which enables him to browbeat the tyrants
behind the stage. Henry James was punctilious, ceremonious, and precise;
it is not to be denied that he was apt to be hasty in taking offence, and not
very ready to overlook an impertinence. The whole existence of the actor is
lax and casual; the manager is the capricious leader of an irresponsible band
of egotists. Henry James lost no occasion of dwelling, in private conversation,
on this aspect of an amiable and entertaining profession. He was not
prepared to accept young actresses at their own valuation, and the happy-go-lucky
democracy of the "mimes," as he bracketed both sexes, irritated him
to the verge of frenzy.</p>

<p>It was, however, with a determination to curb his impatience, and with a
conviction that he could submit his idiosyncrasies to what he called the
"passionate economy" of play-writing, that he began, in 1889, to dedicate
himself to the drama, excluding for the time being all other considerations.
He went over to Paris in the winter of that year, largely to talk over the stage
with Alphonse Daudet and Edmond de Goncourt, and he returned to put
the finishing-touches on <i>The American</i>, a dramatic version of one of his
earliest novels. He finished this play at the Palazzo Barbaro, the beautiful
home of his friends, the Daniel Curtises, in Venice, in June, 1890, thereupon
taking a long holiday, one of the latest of his extended Italian tours, through
Venetia and Tuscany. Edward Compton had by this time accepted <i>The
American</i>, being attracted by his own chances in the part of Christopher
Newman. When Henry James reappeared in London, and particularly when
the rehearsals began, we all noticed how deeply the theatrical virus had
penetrated his nature. His excitement swelled until the evening of
January 3rd, 1891, when <i>The American</i> was acted at Southport by Compton's
company in anticipation of its appearance in London. Henry James was
kind enough to wish me to go down on this occasion with him to Southport,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">683</a></span>
but it was not possible. On the afternoon of the ordeal he wrote to me from
the local hotel: "After eleven o'clock to-night I <i>may</i> be the world's&mdash;you
know&mdash;and I may be the undertaker's. I count upon you and your wife both
to spend this evening in fasting, silence, and supplication. I will send you
a word in the morning, a wire if I can." He was "so nervous that I miswrite
and misspell."</p>

<p>The result, in the provinces, of this first experiment was not decisive.
It is true that he told Robert Louis Stevenson that he was enjoying a success
which made him blush. But the final result in London, where <i>The American</i>
was not played until September, 1891, was only partly encouraging. Henry
James was now cast down as unreasonably as he had been uplifted. He told
me that "the strain, the anxiety, the peculiar form and colour of the ordeal
(not to be divined in the least in advance)" had "sickened him to <i>death</i>."
He used language of the most picturesque extravagance about the "purgatory"
of the performances, which ran at the Opera Comique for two months.
There was nothing in the mediocre fortunes of this play to decide the
questions whether Henry James was or was not justified in abandoning all
other forms of art for the drama. We endeavoured to persuade him that, on
the whole, he was not justified, but he swept our arguments aside, and he
devoted himself wholly to the infatuation of his sterile task.</p>

<p><i>The American</i> had been dramatised from a published novel. Henry James
now thought that he should do better with original plots, and he wrote two
comedies, the one named <i>Tenants</i> and the other <i>Disengaged</i>, of each of which
he formed high expectations. But, although they were submitted to several
managers, who gave them their customary loitering and fluctuating attention,
they were in every case ultimately refused. Each refusal plunged the
dramatist into the lowest pit of furious depression, from which he presently
emerged with freshly-kindled hopes. Like the moralist, he never was but
always to be blest. <i>The Album</i> and <i>The Reprobate</i>&mdash;there is a melancholy
satisfaction in giving life to the mere names of these stillborn children of
his brain&mdash;started with wild hopes and suffered from the same complete
failure to satisfy the caprice of the managers. At the close of 1893, after one
of these "sordid developments," he made up his mind to abandon the
struggle. But George Alexander promised that, if he would but persevere,
he really and truly would produce him infallibly at no distant date, and poor
Henry James could not but persevere. "I mean to wage this war ferociously
for one year more," and he composed, with infinite agony and deliberation
the comedy of <i>Guy Domvile</i>.</p>

<p>The night of January 5th, 1895, was the most tragical in Henry James's
career. His hopes and fears had been strung up to the most excruciating
point, and I think that I have never witnessed such agonies of parturition.
<i>Guy Domvile</i>&mdash;which has never been printed&mdash;was a delicate and picturesque
play, of which the only disadvantage that I could discover was that instead
of having a last scene which tied up all the threads in a neat conclusion, it
left all those threads loose as they would be in life. George Alexander was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">684</a></span>
sanguine of success, and to do Henry James honour such a galaxy of artistic,
literary, and scientific celebrity gathered in the stalls of the St. James's
Theatre as perhaps were never seen in a playhouse before or since. Henry
James was positively storm-ridden with emotion before the fatal night, and
full of fantastic plans. I recall that one was that he should hide in the bar of a
little public-house down an alley close to the theatre, whither I should slip
forth at the end of the second act and report "how it was going." This was
not carried out, and fortunately Henry James resisted the temptation of
being present in the theatre during the performance. All seemed to be going
fairly well until the close, when Henry James appeared and was called before
the curtain only to be subjected&mdash;to our unspeakable horror and shame&mdash;to
a storm of hoots and jeers and catcalls from the gallery, answered by loud
and sustained applause from the stalls, the whole producing an effect of hell
broke loose, in the midst of which the author, as white as chalk, bowed and
spread forth deprecating hands and finally vanished. It was said at the time,
and confirmed later, that this horrible performance was not intended to
humiliate Henry James, but was the result of a cabal against George
Alexander.</p>

<p>Early next morning I called at 34 De Vere Gardens, hardly daring to press
the bell for fear of the worst of news, so shattered with excitement had the
playwright been on the previous evening. I was astonished to find him
perfectly calm; he had slept well and was breakfasting with appetite. The
theatrical bubble in which he had lived a tormented existence for five years
was wholly and finally broken, and he returned, even in that earliest conversation,
to the discussion of the work which he had so long and so sadly neglected,
the art of direct prose narrative. And now a remarkable thing happened.
The discipline of toiling for the caprices of the theatre had amounted, for so
redundant an imaginative writer, to the putting on of a mental strait-jacket.
He saw now that he need stoop no longer to what he called "a meek and
lowly review of the right ways to keep on the right side of a body of people
who have paid money to be amused at a particular hour and place." Henry
James was not released from this system of vigorous renunciation without
a very singular result. To write for the theatre the qualities of brevity and
directness, of an elaborate plainness, had been perceived by him to be
absolutely necessary, and he had tried to cultivate them with dogged patience
for five years. But when he broke with the theatre, the rebound was excessive.
I recall his saying to me, after the fiasco of <i>Guy Domvile</i>, "At all events,
I have escaped for ever from the foul fiend Excision!" He vibrated with the
sense of liberation, and he began to enjoy, physically and intellectually, a
freedom which had hitherto been foreign to his nature.</p>

<h2>A CASE FOR RECORDS</h2>

<p class="center">By HILARY JENKINSON</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IT</span> has long been a commonplace of depreciation to say that England
possesses more valuable collections of historical documents than
any other country, and displays more indifference to them. "<i>En
Angleterre tout est en désordre</i>," says an eminent French critic: and
the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> quotes <span class="locked">him.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> Since the middle of last century
the declared classes of public records in this country (those of the Central
Government) have, it is true, had a settled habitation, a staff to look after
them, and a good deal of attention from a small section of the public; also
a considerable, though relatively small, number of publications has been
devoted to them and some of the clamorous interests, the genealogist's,
for example, fed if not sated. The same amount of good fortune, except by
the hazard of their coming into the hands of an enthusiast, has not in many
cases befallen the records belonging to local bodies; still less has it come to
the enormous private collections originally accumulated in connection with
the descent of real property, and now, since the invention of "short title,"
no longer in any demand for their primary purpose. If the public records
of the past may in our day be considered to have found safety, it is still
possible to witness in this country the unedifying spectacle of the museum
or the rich collector buying up the pretty specimen from a collection of
manorial records, while the remainder, of which it should form an integral
part, after the lesser lights of the collecting world have taken gradual toll of
it, goes without protest from any one to the tambourine-maker or the glue
merchant. It is as though an anatomist, having exhumed his great-grandfather,
should add to that injury the insult of preserving an interesting
metacarpal in his cabinet, while he distributes the rest of the body to various
colleagues, with remainder to the manufacturer of fertilisers: one is tempted
to send science to blazes and wish the poor old gentleman might have been
left intact, if useless, underground.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_32" id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> November 27th, 1919.</p></div>

<p>I have spoken in this first paragraph of the unhappy state of the small
collections in England because that state is an obvious and striking result of
the same cause which has produced most of our mistakes in the preservation,
sorting and editing of documents in the past; because the distinction at
present existing between the public and the private collections is so symptomatic
of our worst failure in this field: in effect, in all these years during
which historical documents have met with a certain amount of appreciation,
it has apparently never occurred to us to make definite search for the essential
features common to all records, high or low, and to apply to all records a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">686</a></span>
treatment based on the examination of those features. But the most interesting
archive question of the present time seems to me to be the question of the
records we ourselves are producing. If our shortcomings as owners of
archives have affected adversely our treatment of what the past has left
to us, are they not capable of doing quite as much harm to that which we
ourselves are to bequeath to the future? And, further, if England, owing to
its wealth of records, provides a particularly large number of examples of
things to be avoided, is it not possible that the application of the warning
derived from these may prove to be common to other countries? It is,
indeed, no new criticism of the French School, the acknowledged leader of
the world in this matter, to say that the circumstances under which the
French national collections were put together have led it sometimes to
consider the isolated <i>document</i> rather to the exclusion of that <i>record</i> which
forms only a single link in a long chain.</p>

<p>We are led, therefore, to inquire how far certain generalisations, based on
the character of our existing English records, maybe applied as criteria to
the treatment of those records which are accumulating in our own time in
England and perhaps in other countries.</p>

<p>A record, if we may venture here to give definition to a loosely-used word,
is a document drawn up, or at any rate made use of, in the course of an
administrative process, of which itself forms a part, and subsequently
preserved in his own custody for his own reference by the administrator
concerned or his successors. The process and the administration may be as
important or unimportant as you please; the result may be the Rolls of
Chancery or the deed-box of a manor: the essential features are the same
in both cases&mdash;the administrative origin, the administrative reason for
preservation, the preservation in administrative custody: so also are the
results the same from the point of view of the subsequent 'ologist&mdash;the two
priceless qualities of authenticity and impartiality; the first proceeding from
the fact that the records have been always in <span class="locked">custody,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> and in a certain
relationship one with another, the second derived from the fact that they
were not drawn up for the information of <span class="locked">posterity,<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span> and, therefore, have no
bias to one side or the other of posterity's problems. Any number of interesting
<span class="locked">instances<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span> might be adduced from the records of the past, both of the
value of these qualities and of the ease with which they may be flawed;
but let us here leave for the time consideration of the records the past has
bequeathed to us and inquire how far the qualities which, with all its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">687</a></span>
historical faults, it gave us in most of its documents are going to be found by
our descendants in those we leave to them. The unprecedented mass of
documents which the various executive departments must have accumulated
during the war may well frighten us into a serious consideration of this
subject at the present moment.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33" id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> The licence of high officials has sometimes violated this, a practice much to be deprecated.
I refer to this again below.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_34" id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> This fact may, of course, lead in ignorant times, such as was the early nineteenth century,
to destruction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_35" id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> A well-known case is the volume, belonging to the records of the Master of the Revels,
which, if it is genuine, dates one of Shakespeare's plays: unfortunately it was for a considerable
time out of official custody, and doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the most important
page.</p></div>

<p>Now, the rules for safe preservation and custody are simple things, matters
of proved experience, a number of which are set out in a small book recently
published in England, and at more length in the well-known Continental
<span class="locked">treatise;<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> and though the standard of archive-keeping by local authorities
is at present very uneven, we may, for the shortening of this article, dismiss
that side of the question with pious hopes. Assuming, then, that the documents
of our own time, when they come to the state of archives, will be
preserved in suitable places and under proper rules of custody, assuming
further that we are able to drill archivists into leaving their charges as far as
possible in the physical order and state in which they find them (so as to
preserve the old association of document with document), we have to face
as our chief danger a threat not so much to the authenticity of the record
as to its impartiality&mdash;the most important of all its qualities and one which,
once damaged, cannot be restored. Interference with impartiality may occur
at two points: in the first place it may occur, as indeed it has sometimes
done in the past, at or near the time of the document's making; the administrator
who makes it may himself have an eye on posterity. We shall have to
recur to this again, but for the moment let us turn to the second, which is
the more serious because it brings us up against the great modern record
problem, bulk: impartiality may be&mdash;rather, is&mdash;impugned when we come
to the selection of documents for preservation.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_36" id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> C. Johnson: <i>The Care of Documents</i> (S.P.C.K. Helps for Students of History); and
Muller, Feith, and Fruin: <i>Manuel pour le Classement des Archives</i>.</p></div>

<p>The obvious remedy for this is not to select&mdash;to preserve everything;
but this is in practice an equally obvious impossibility: the instance already
quoted of the accumulation of our war <span class="locked">records<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> would no doubt supply apt
illustration, but the custodian of county records is faced on his small scale
with exactly the same difficulty: we are all confronted, in fact, with this main
problem&mdash;how are we to reconcile our desire to preserve in our records
certain qualities which have accompanied in the past an uncontrolled
accumulation with the necessity of our own day for restriction? Up to now,
in face of this problem, and in face of the system of selection, or destruction,
which is actually in use, no one (not even the Royal Commission, which
has obviously devoted much attention to the subject) has really gone further
than to tell the selectors that they must be very careful. But can they? Let
us take a case of public records, an imaginary class of, say, 200,000 pieces to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">688</a></span>
be dealt with in a limited space of time by a limited number of people who
have probably other work waiting to be done: how can they possibly say
(since they have not the time to make a detailed comparison) that all the
information contained in certain documents which they propose to condemn
is to be found elsewhere? Or, taking another criterion, how can they say
that certain documents are going to be without interest for the future?
There are classes of documents in the Public Record Office now frequently
used and highly valued which little more than fifty years ago might well
have been destroyed as having no interest for any branch of human study
then known.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_37" id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Records so vast that in its last report (1919) the Royal Commission has found it necessary
to alter its original (1914) recommendations regarding the provision of new repository accommodation.</p></div>

<p>At this point the natural thing is to seek the advice of the historian, who
is indeed, being an enthusiast, anxious to give it. Now, the historian may
fairly claim to have done much for records in the past. He is mainly responsible
for the recognition of public records as things valuable and to be kept
carefully for other reasons than that of mere antiquity; and he has done
something in England (one always hopes that he will do more presently) for
local and private collections. But he cannot predict the needs of future
research workers (who may not be historians at all) any more than he was
able to predict in the time of the old Record Commission the needs of our
own day: witness the indexes, quite useless to an economic historian, of the
very important Chancery Rolls of King John, published about 1830. Even
if we grant that he may make a better guess than other men, we are met by
a still graver objection in the fact that we cannot rule out at least the possibility
(since he is human and an historian) of his having a predilection for the
evidence which will establish a certain view or emphasise a certain line of
inquiry. The use of an historian, or of any other person who uses records for
research purposes, as a selector seems to me incompatible with the preservation
of their characteristic impartiality: there will be a possibility&mdash;and the
mere possibility is enough&mdash;of <i>suppressio veri</i>, if not of <i>suggestio falsi</i>; and
what should have been a record, preserved by circumstances which do not
affect its value as evidence, will become no more than the narrative or at
most the <i>pièce justificative</i> of a specialist; you might as well allow a botanist
to produce a hybrid in order to prove not its possibility but its existence as
a natural form.</p>

<p>But if we cannot use the historian for our purposes we may perhaps call
in the trained archivist. I am afraid that here again we shall find no help.
The archivist may take an interest in any of the subjects upon which his
collections furnish evidence; but such interests have nothing to do with
(indeed they sometimes impede) the duties that are his of safeguarding,
arranging, and making accessible and of basing himself for all these duties on
the internal structure of the classes of documents in his charge: with the
possible exception of the last there is nothing in these qualifications to make
him more fit than the historian for the work of selection&mdash;and destruction.</p>

<p>Is there, then, no possible way&mdash;we will not say of dealing with our
present accumulations; they, it may be, on account of their sheer bulk must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_689" id="Page_689">689</a></span>
be dealt with by such <i>ad hoc</i> methods as the circumstances admit of; and
into those methods it is not our province here to enter&mdash;but merely for our
guidance in the future, is there no chance of reconciling the requirements of
ourselves and posterity (so far as these can be foreseen) with the intrinsic
interests of the records themselves&mdash;the external with the internal&mdash;or rather
perhaps of finding some method of treatment which will give to our records
a reasonable bulk while preserving their important characteristics, and at the
same time will at least not sacrifice unduly the interests of the research-worker?
Perhaps an indication of such a possibility is to be found in the
words "our present accumulations" which we used above. How would it
be if we set ourselves in the future to prevent accumulations?</p>

<p>A certain amount of contemporary destruction of the more obviously
ephemeral papers&mdash;notes from one department of an office to another saying,
"Passed to you, please," and perhaps documents of a more advanced type&mdash;does,
of course, in our own days sometimes take place in large offices.
And there are not wanting indications that a perception of the need of something
more, especially in regard to public offices, has been growing since the
Act of 1877, provided that the Master of the Rolls might make rules respecting
the disposal by destruction or otherwise of documents which are
deposited in or can be removed to the Public Record Office (note the lack of
any distinction between the two classes) and which are not of sufficient
public value to justify their preservation in the Public Record Office. Such
an indication is seen in the desire expressed by the late Royal Commission
on Public <span class="locked">Records<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span> for the substitution in Government offices of destruction
and preservation of documents according to well-considered principles for
destruction founded on arbitrary, varying opinions; and for the relief of the
Public Record Office Repository from a cumbersome mass of useless or
unnecessary documents. But no one, so far as I am aware, has yet summed
up and balanced, for the benefit of all records and record-keepers, whether
public or private, the merits and demerits of the various systems of destruction,
either in the light of the intrinsic character of records themselves or in
that of the experience gained from a study of our ancestors' methods. And
the accumulations of documents, many of which are subsequently judged
not to be material, continue.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_38" id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> First report, p. 41; cp.: second report, p. 71, etc.</p></div>

<p>Now we may assume, indeed we know, that from the earliest times not
only selections of subjects for representation in permanent records but also
actual destruction of documents has been practised by the administrators
who have left us their collections. Only&mdash;and here is the distinction&mdash;since
the question of bulk did not trouble them as it does us, they were able to act
solely on the ground that the record in question was not required for their
current administrative purposes. Note that in this their impartiality was not
affected by the external considerations of either this world or the next,
neither by any interest in the history-writing of the future, nor by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">690</a></span>
exigencies of floor-space in the present. Any subsequent destruction, direct
or indirect, by our ancestors was quite a different matter: such destruction
has invariably been the subject ultimately of adverse criticism, though no
doubt the person responsible saw no particular harm in it. For example,
take the case of the burning of the Exchequer tallies in 1834. The position of
contemporaries is probably represented tolerably by that of Charles Dickens,
who criticised the proceeding on the ground not only that it burned down the
Houses of Parliament, but also that it was a wanton waste of firewood which
might have been given to the poor: yet already we, not a hundred years
after, are regretting it. On the other hand, though historians are in the habit
of saying vaguely that much which was of incalculable value must have been
lost, they refer always to the losses due to various forms of carelessness. I
have never heard anyone venture to criticise the Chancery, for example,
because it did not preserve full copies of non-returnable writs or the
Exchequer because certain draft accounts were destroyed.</p>

<p>What, in fact, are the principal gaps in old records which affect us moderns?
If we take two of the documents which have thrown light on the personal
history of Shakespeare (not a matter of much moment to his contemporaries)
we shall arrive at a clear distinction between two different kinds of destruction,
or shall we say failure to preserve? On the one hand, we have a document
signed by Shakespeare as a witness: all that mattered to the court here was
that certain evidence had been given by some indifferent person and
accepted. Could we have blamed it if it had failed to preserve this signature
which we find so intriguing, or had allowed it (as was sometimes done) to
be written in by the scribe who took down the deposition? Or if it had
preserved the whole document only in the form of a summary? Most
certainly we could not: how was the court to know that we should be
interested in Shakespeare's life and handwriting? On the other hand, take
the case where Shakespeare himself was party to a fine: had the court of
Common Pleas failed to preserve the "foot" of that fine, which was a
recognised form of evidence of its own transactions, we should legitimately
criticise its carelessness.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that the only criticism posterity will be able to pass
on us, if we adhere to the practice of our ancestors, will be one based
on the extent to which we leave record behind us of the work of the various
administrations; and our further queries then resolve themselves into two:</p>

<p>(1) Can we train our administrator so to keep his records <i>at the time they
are made</i> that they will give a fair picture of the activities of his office, and
this without desiring him to do it for the benefit of posterity, without making
an historian of him?</p>

<p>(2) Can this be done so economically as to get rid of the bulk difficulty in
connection with preservation?</p>

<p>If the answer to each of these questions is "Yes," then our problem is solved.</p>

<p>It is not, of course, possible to answer them in detail here, because to do so
would involve inserting a detailed scheme for the keeping of archives in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">691</a></span>
modern office; it would also involve going into such highly technical, and
in some cases controversial, matters as the use and abuse of flimsies, the
whole position of the typewriter in record-making (with an excursus on
carbons and inks), the comparative merits of various filing systems, and, as
regards this country at least, liaison between Government departments.
But we may perhaps try in the most general terms to lay down a few first
principles and see how far they indicate the possibility of an answer. We may
premise that while no two accountants differ radically in their methods, the
name of the various filing systems and practices is legion; while we have had
double-entry for three or four hundred years, no one has yet hit on a system
of filing correspondence and the like which commands general approval;
from which we may draw the corollary that almost everywhere there are
large redundancies.</p>

<p>If, then, we are to educate our administrator we should begin</p>

<p>(1) By explaining the trouble that has been caused by accumulations of
records in the past and the impossibility of dealing with them reliably and
satisfactorily in the present. This trouble we require him to prevent in the
future by a system of personal attention and studied economy. (He would,
of course, say at once that this could not be done; the reply is "Have you
tried?")</p>

<p>(2) The next point is concerned also with authenticity, but it is in every
way of primary <span class="locked">importance.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39" id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> How important may be judged from the perusal of more than one modern volume of more
than one great statesman's "Private Papers"&mdash;many of them public records which have been
taken out of custody. Perhaps the new diplomacy may do something to remedy this evil.</p></div>

<p>Every office, no matter how small, must have a <span class="locked">registry;<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> <i>i.e.</i>, must be
divided up, <i>qua</i> records, into two branches, administrative and executive;
it must have a small branch which keeps and controls, distinct from the
large which makes and uses, documents. Registry, the keeper and controller
of office papers, is to lay down the way in which letters are to be written and
whether copies are to be made. When they are made (or received, if they
come from without) all office documents are the property of registry, which
is responsible for destruction or preservation (with, of course, the advantage
of advice from the executive side in a large office) and for safeguarding and
methods of arrangement.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> I hope I shall not be accused of ignorance of the fact that registries do exist in some offices.
The point is, first, that their existence is not universal; second, that they have not yet been
turned towards those functions which it is here suggested they should fulfil.</p></div>

<p>(3) The golden rule for administrators is: in preserving and arranging
documents keep in view a single purpose, that of enabling an ignorant
successor by their means to carry on if you and the whole of your staff were
blotted out. We depend largely on this rule for an answer to the historian's
objection that the administrator if left to himself will destroy all the valuable
things&mdash;lose the Shakespeare fine, in fact. It is not, however, inserted here for
that purpose, but because it is obviously sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">692</a></span>
(4) Apart from this rule the first principle should be economy; and
economy, if registry is not to be overburdened with work, must consist
largely in rules carefully thought out concerning not the documents which
are to be destroyed, but the documents which are never to be made: for
example, probably at least 50 per cent. of the copies of out-letters which are
preserved in a big office record nothing more than despatch, which could be
done in two words or less in a general register.</p>

<p>(5) The ideal subject index, it has been said, would have only one entry
and any quantity of cross-references; similarly there is an ideal of a single
master series in records: being an ideal, neither of these things is realisable,
but it is possible to get near to them. For example, registry can and should
have a record of its own, a single general register, and a properly made entry
in this would be amply sufficient record of many transactions which are at
present dignified with a <i>dossier</i>.</p>

<p>(6) In this connection we may refer to the necessity for the intelligent use
of mechanical devices: many duplicates and unnecessary documents are
habitually kept owing to a failure to appreciate the merits as distinguishing
features of a red pencil and a blue, the opposition of left to right, the possibilities
of the first and the second column, not to mention the third, fourth,
and fifth....</p>

<p>(7) Registry should have a clear conception of the nature of records&mdash;that
there are only three kinds: In-letters, out-letters, and memoranda
(including accounts). A realisation of this and of the way in which records
work into each other means economy in internal arrangement, and in the case
of Government offices might, if liaison were close and a single system of
record-keeping in general use, make new economies possible as between
departments.</p>

<p>(8) So far we have been considering the possibilities of an economy which
consists in not making documents; but we have, of course, to consider also
actual destruction, of which there are three kinds: (<i>a</i>) First, there is what we
may call <i>posthumous destruction</i>, the kind which is now most in vogue, and
which we want to stop altogether: that is the destruction which deals with
an accumulation formed perhaps years before&mdash;destruction for its own sake,
because of over-great bulk. Then (<i>b</i>) there is <i>immediate destruction</i>, which
gives effect to the judgment passed at the earliest possible moment on a
document: you wait only until a letter (let us say perhaps a letter making an
appointment) is acknowledged, and then, since its actual terms concern only
the person addressed, and for your office's purposes you have sufficient
evidence in your registry, you destroy. (<i>c</i>) Finally, there is <i>deferred destruction</i>,
the kind which comes into operation where a document, already condemned,
so far as concerns the purposes of the office, is temporarily preserved for
some purely external reason; for example, in connection with the provisions
of the Statute of Limitations.</p>

<p>(9) A primary rule of destruction is that no letter-in, copy of letter-out,
or draft of office memoranda shall be kept which does not mean a stage in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">693</a></span>
advance for the office's business. But it is particularly necessary that this
destruction should take place at the earliest possible moment, while the
business is fresh in the minds of those concerned; because there are documents
which, though they have no direct result themselves, yet by that very
fact mark an advance in the policy (let us say) of a department, and delay
in the consideration of these might conceivably be dangerous.</p>

<p>(10) For the purposes of <i>deferred destruction</i> some system of automatic
working will be necessary; for instance, if large masses of papers, valueless
otherwise to the office, have to be kept, say, for six years for legal reasons,
there should be a regular system by which every day the register of six years
back should be examined and the papers there marked (let us say) D.D.,
for deferred destruction, should be at once drawn, disposed of, and marked
off. It is possible that some system might be introduced to cover doubtful
cases, which could be given a short lease of life&mdash;some statutory number of
months, pending a decision by circumstances upon their value. This would
be a good safeguard against careless destruction, though that should never
occur.</p>

<p>(11) Finally, lest this compromise should let in abuses, there must be a
short time of probation for documents fixed, perhaps not more than a year;
and, as soon as any document has passed through that, it should automatically
go to the record class, where no further destruction is permitted; it would
probably in practice be subjected to a final scrutiny a few days before it
reached this happy state. As many such documents might still be needed for
reference, they would possibly remain with those still on probation or go only
to some intermediate muniment-room, not to the final record repository,
but they would be records, full-fledged.</p>

<p>The above suggestions are offered only as suggestions, susceptible of
much revision and needing much more expansion. The only claim made for
them is that they do face the real difficulty of the record situation, and do
sketch lines along which the reasonable requirements of the historian, or
any other worker who may be destined in the future to pursue strange
learning along unthought-of paths, are adequately met; the question of bulk
is met, and the present system of dealing in a hopeless kind of way with
accumulations already formed and hardened is got rid of; and violence is not
done to the structure of the records themselves.</p>

<p>Criticism of the proposed system will probably be divided between
statements that it does too much and that it does too little. We may reply
that there is no inherent impossibility in the <i>via media</i>, that all alternative
systems are destructive of the most essential qualities of records, and that
ours is, therefore, at least worth a trial.</p>

<p>Attempts are from time to time made in most large offices to secure the
keeping of documents in a manner convenient to those who use them for
official purposes. But why not something longer sighted, a little care for the
records themselves? Why not a <i>Manual of Record Making and Keeping
for Clerks in Government and other Offices</i>?</p>

<h2>ON INTERPRETATION IN MUSIC</h2>

<p class="center">By SIR GEORGE HENSCHEL, Mus.Doc.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> question of interpretation, especially in the field of music,
and more particularly as regards song, has been prominent of
late. Lectures on interpretation, books on the subject have been
announced in the papers under more or less attractive titles, but I
fear I have never read the latter, nor gone to any of the former. Indeed I
confess that throughout my life I have given little, if any, thought to interpretation:
a fact not easily accounted for, unless it be that when I was
young, people must have been more unsophisticated. Interpretation in music
was a thing rarely spoken of. If, for instance, there was a Beethoven symphony
on the programme of a concert, people went because they wanted to hear the
symphony, not how a conductor interpreted it. It evidently sufficed these
good people to have confidence in the musicianship and skill of the members
of an orchestra and in the loyalty of their conductor as regards carrying out
the composer's wishes as to <i>tempo</i> and expression, confidence altogether in
the efficiency of any artist ready to brave the test of publicity. Moreover,
conductors were then stationary; the fashion of prima-donna conductors,
travelling from one place to another, each trying to outdo his rival in so-called
originality, had not come into being, and there was little opportunity for a
comparison.</p>

<p>Of course, I had read or heard of points in law being capable of different
interpretation by different lawyers, also was aware of the fact that interpreters
are persons who, being masters of several languages, act between two people
ignorant of each other's tongue, or whose office it is to translate orally in
their presence the words of parties speaking different languages, but I never
connected the term with music, which, I thought, being a language spoken
and understood all the world over, did not require the services of an interpreter.
This, of course, was a very youthful notion. But even in later years
the question did not interest me very much, and it was not until three or
four years ago the editor of an American musical magazine asked me to write
for his paper an article which he wished to be entitled "Some Elementary
Truths on Song-Interpretation" that the matter attracted my serious attention.
I remember answering the gentleman: "My dear sir,&mdash;Since we are
still waiting for a satisfactory answer to the ancient question 'What is truth?'
I must confess myself utterly incompetent to gratify your flattering desire;
indeed, without immodesty, I hope, should be reluctant to accept any mortal's
opinion regarding a question of art as truth." Somehow or other, however,
the thing got hold of me and I began to be curious to see what could be said,
or at any rate what I might be able to say on the subject. So, first of all, I
consulted the Oxford Dictionary to see whether among the various definitions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">695</a></span>
of the word "Interpretation," which that wonderfully complete book was
sure to offer, there might not be one applicable to music, or altogether to
art. And there I found that "To interpret" may mean:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Expound the meaning of, bring out, make out the meaning of, explain, understand,
render by artistic representation or performance.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Well, this was something to start from, anyhow. Let us see: "Expound the
meaning of."</p>

<p>From the oracles of old, not infrequently more obscure on purpose to give
them greater importance, down to a speech from the front benches, utterances
in <i>words</i> may, and indeed often do, need expounding the meaning of, but it
seems to me in music, and, perhaps, in art altogether, the necessity for
explanation nearly always indicates a certain degree of inferiority. I cannot
imagine anyone looking at a Velasquez, or Titian, or Rembrandt, or Michelangelo
asking "What <i>does</i> it mean?" but I am sure we all have heard
that question, very likely emphasised by the addition of two little words,
like "on earth," or something stronger, at exhibitions of Futurist art.</p>

<p>So in a piece of absolute music, <i>i.e.</i>, music without words, for an orchestra
or a solo instrument, any attempt at expounding the meaning of, make out
the meaning of, must, in my humble opinion, always be more or less of a
failure, whilst, of course, there can be no need of such an attempt at all if
the music be programme music, or if, by the title given to it, like, for instance,
Elegy, Reverie, Humoreske, Nocturne, Barcarolle, and so on, the composer
clearly has indicated his intention. There is no need asking what Bach,
Beethoven, Brahms meant by their symphonies, their fugues.</p>

<p>You might as well ask what the meaning of a cathedral. These things are
there for us to wonder at the greatness and power of the human mind, to
lose ourselves in admiration of the various forms of beauty in which they
reveal themselves, to bow down, to worship. On the other hand, in music
with words, the poems chosen by the composer are rarely sufficiently obscure
or eccentric to require "expounding the meaning of."</p>

<p>It seems to me, therefore, that the only definition of the word interpretation
with which we need concern ourselves is "Render by artistic representation
or performance." And that would seem simple enough were it not
that when it comes to a song we have to deal with a compound of poetry and
music which complicates matters inasmuch as there is art required for
reciting a poem as well as for singing the music.</p>

<p>That the music of a song, as such, may be beautifully rendered by an
instrument other than the voice we all know. Who&mdash;to quote only one
example&mdash;has not heard Schubert's <i>Ave Maria</i> played on a 'cello? And
the words of a song detached from the music may find an ideal interpreter
in the person of a talented reciter, who, as regards music, may not know one
note from another. The perfect interpreter of a song, therefore, would have
to combine in him or herself the talents and qualities of both a reciter and a
singer, and it will be seen at once that, as in song the music is of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">696</a></span>
first importance, not only should an intending singer make a point of
studying music as well as singing, but the study of theory, harmony,
counterpoint, etc., that is to say, of music as a <i>creative</i> art should always be
made the foundation on which all special studies for expressing that art
should rest.</p>

<p>I have just said that in a song the music is first in importance. Should,
therefore, by any chance a composer have failed, as some of the best have
been known to now and then, to make the music fit the words completely, it
would be the duty of the singer to consider the <i>musical</i> phrase in the first
instance and fit in the words as well as possible under the circumstances,
even at the risk of breaking between two words which otherwise it would
be better not to separate.</p>

<p>The question of breathing is altogether one which puzzles a great many
singers. Take, for instance, a Bach or Handel aria, with semiquaver runs,
often extending over half-a-dozen bars or more. There are singers who
deem it beneath their dignity to breathe during such a run, and go on
until they are red in the face, or else, if they see they must after all, put in
additional words. This is quite unnecessary. Such occasions should be treated
instrumentally. Give such a run to, say, an oboe player and you will find that
he now and then will take an instantaneous little breath which enables him
to do justice to every note and carry the thing through successfully and
without exhaustion. It is generally the childish fear of being thought lacking
in physical strength which induces some singers to delay breathing until the
thought of their bursting a blood vessel remains the only one left in the poor
listener, rendering anything like interpretation and, therefore, artistic enjoyment
of such a performance utterly impossible. If you know <i>how</i> to breathe,
<i>i.e.</i>, how to replenish your lungs in the twinkling of an eye and imperceptibly,
you cannot really breathe too often, for by such judicious breathing you are
infinitely better able to satisfactorily accomplish the task before you. I
remember being asked, years ago, to hear, with a view to giving my opinion
on her talent and voice, a young singer, now quite famous, and being horrified
at her utterly mistaken idea as to breathing. Disregarding all thought of
intelligent phrasing, she actually never breathed unless positively obliged to
do so. I stood it as long as I could and then got really angry. I stopped her
short and said, "My dear young lady, do you wish to show the people what
wonderful lungs you have, or what a beautiful song it is you are singing?"
You can only do one of the two things at a time. Supposing even your breathing
be good, which, being neither inaudible nor invisible, I am sorry to say
it is not; you will have to learn that an accomplishment, be it ever so great,
in anything pertaining to a detail in the mere <i>technique</i> of an art becomes a
fault the moment attention is drawn to it. A singer who after the singing of
a beautiful song is complimented on the excellent management of his breath
or the wonderful articulation of his words should go home and resolve to
do better next time, and not rest satisfied until he feels that the singer's
highest aim should be the full appreciation and enjoyment on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">697</a></span>
the listener of the work interpreted. That aim being achieved he need wish
for no greater praise.</p>

<p>For an intelligent and thoroughly satisfactory rendering of a song it is
absolutely imperative that the vocal technique of the singer&mdash;and the
breathing is as important a part of it as the actual singing&mdash;be developed to
a state of efficiency, such as to need no more thought than, for instance, a
pianist interpreting a Beethoven sonata should have to give to the fingering.
All technical difficulties should have been overcome once for all and technique
itself become a matter of course before an attempt at interpretation
is made.</p>

<p>The two principal factors in the technique of singing are vocalisation
and articulation, the one referring to music, the other&mdash;articulation&mdash;to
speech, each complementing the other, though I hold that of the two articulation
is the more important, since it is not the vowels but the consonants
which enable a singer to "bring out the meaning of," <i>i.e.</i>, to interpret a
word. You may sing the vowel, for instance, of the word "soul" ever so
beautifully, it is not until you add the "l" with the same intensity of
purpose that the word puts on flesh and blood, as it were, and becomes a
living thing. Or take the word "remember." No actor, impersonating, for
instance, the ghost of Hamlet's father, could make an impression with the
word by dwelling on the vowel "Reme-e-e&mdash;&mdash;," but leaving the vowel
quickly and continuing to sound the "m" a good actor could walk almost
across the whole stage holding on to that consonant without exaggeration&mdash;"Remem-m-m-ber."
It is the consonants, as I said before, which convey
the meaning of a word, and they should be made the subject of special
study. If you wish to interpret you should, in the first place, strive to make
yourself understood, and that, with the best vocalisation in the world, you can
do only by a mastery of the consonants, <i>i.e.</i>, by a perfect articulation. You all
know that delicious story of the dear old lady coming home from a village
concert, where the hit of the evening had been made by a girl singing,
"Wae's me for Prince Charlie." Being asked whether she had enjoyed the
concert, she said, "Not very much; I couldn't understand half the people
who sang, except one girl who sang a nice funny song." "Do you remember
the title?" "No, but she kept on asking 'Where's me fourpence, Charlie?'"
This singer evidently had <i>not</i> made a special study of consonants.</p>

<p>In vocalisation, too, there are certain details which often fail to receive, on
the part of the singer, the attention which should be paid to them. One of them,
and, in my opinion, a very important one, because of its great help towards
interpretation, is the <i>colouring</i> of the tone. I have heard many an otherwise
good singer whose singing became exceedingly monotonous after a while
by reason of a lack of variety in tone-colour, and I remember one lady in particular,
the possessor of a beautiful rich contralto voice, from whose singing&mdash;had
it not been for the words&mdash;you could not possibly have told whether
what she sang was sad or cheerful. And yet our five vowels A, E, I, O, U
being what we may call the primary colours of the voice, a singer should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">698</a></span>
able, by skilful and judicious mixing of these colours, to produce as many
different shades of, let us say, the vowel A as a painter of the colour, say, of
red. I have in my long experience of a teacher found it of the utmost value
to make a pupil sing even a whole song on nothing but the vowels of the
words, with the object of expressing the character of the music by mere
vocalisation. We all love that glorious aria in the <i>Messiah</i>, "He was despised."
Well, let a student try to convey its sadness, its deeply religious feeling in
that way, <i>i.e.</i>, without words, by the instrument of the voice alone, and, if
after a while she succeeds, she will have taken a very big step toward realising,
<i>i.e.</i>, toward interpreting, the full beauty of that exquisite blending of words
and music. For a thoroughly artistic rendering of emotional songs of that kind
or of songs of dramatic character, such as ballads in which the singer has to
impersonate character and run up and down the gamut of passion, it is of
the greatest importance that the singer should have under perfect control not
only his technique, but his feelings too. If your feelings get the better of you
before the public, you are apt temporarily, and for physical reasons, to lose
the mastery of your technique. There is a story told of the famous American
actor, Edwin Booth, whose daughter, his severest critic, always, at his request,
had to be in the stage-box where and whenever he acted. On one occasion
the play was Victor Hugo's <i>The King's Jester</i>, known to us all from Verdi's
<i>Rigoletto</i>. The part of the Jester was considered one of the best of Booth's
many fine impersonations. When the harrowing scene came in which the
poor man finds the body of his murdered daughter in the sack, Booth on
that night for some reason or other was so overcome by the situation that
actual tears ran down his cheeks, and he thought he had never acted that
scene better or with greater feeling. The first thing his daughter said to
him as they met in his dressing-room after the play was, "Were you quite
well, father?" "Quite. Why?" "Because that scene with Gilda's body
never made so little impression on me and on the people, as far as I could see."</p>

<p>And naturally. When you lose control of yourself you must not expect
to be able to control your audience.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there was a great singer, Wilhelmina Schroeder-Devrient,
the greatest exponent of the part of Leonora in Beethoven's
<i>Fidelio</i>. In that wonderful scene in the underground prison when, disguised
as the jailor's boy, and unrecognised by her unfortunate husband,
the chained prisoner Florestan, she hands the starving man a crust of bread,
singing to Beethoven's touchingly appealing notes, and in a voice choked
with emotion, "There, take this bread, thou poor, poor man," that great
singer was often known to actually crack a little aside joke with old Rocco,
the jailor, whilst the front of the house was in tears. That is what I call art.
Very likely she had cried herself many a time over that same scene when
studying it.</p>

<p>Of course the actor&mdash;and by that I mean the operatic-singer as well&mdash;has
a not inconsiderable advantage over the concert-singer, in that he possesses
in facial expression and gesture two additional aids to interpretation, both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">699</a></span>
important and powerful. I say two, although facial expression is available to the
concert-singer as well, but whilst that and gesture form an essential part in
the training of the actor, facial expression is hardly ever systematically studied
by the singer of songs who, in this respect, is left to his own resources with
often rather curious results. I have listened to many a singer&mdash;I am sorry to say
mostly of the fair sex&mdash;who, very likely for fear of making grimaces, maintained
throughout a whole song, and heedless of the varying moods and sentiments
expressed in it, a sickly, inane, apologetic sort of a smile, whilst, on the other
hand, I remember hearing a famous singer who, in Schubert's great song,
<i>Der Doppelgänger</i>, allowed his features already during the short prelude
to the song to assume a most ghastly expression of pain and terror which,
quite apart from such a proceeding being apt to have the opposite effect, was
in this case quite the wrong thing to do, for the opening of the song is merely
a sad recollection, on the part of the unfortunate lover, of happier times
when his beloved was still inhabiting the house he is passing. "The night is
still, the streets are silent, 'twas in this house my true love lived." The tragedy
and horror only commence with "There too stands a man and gazes up on
high, and wrings his hands in agony of pain," reaching the climax with the
words, "I shudder when I behold his face, the moon reveals to me my own
image." But when this climax came it was robbed of much of its impressiveness
by the singer having anticipated it. He evidently took it for granted
that his listeners knew Heine's poem and Schubert's song, or had made themselves
acquainted with the words beforehand by looking into the book of
words. That is a great mistake. You should always sing as if the song you are
interpreting had never been known or sung before, and you were the first
to make it public. Every one of you, I am sure, has at one time or other told
a little fairy-story to a child. You know how deliberately such a story should
be told, how distinctly the pronunciation of every syllable, every consonant,
in order that the little ones may grasp the meaning of what you are saying
the very moment you are saying it, so as not to lose the thread of the tale,
to break the spell. Well, that's the way you should sing. Even if you <i>know</i>
that what you are singing is the most well-known, popular, hackneyed thing,
always imagine one person in your audience&mdash;sitting in the very last row&mdash;to
whom it is something absolutely new, and that imaginary person should
be the child to whom you are telling a story. So you see all these little details
have to be thought out. The singer should even be careful in the selection of
his songs. (When I speak of "him" and "his" I, of course, mean "her"
and "hers" as well.) The greater the singer's art the more will he be able
to force his hearers into forgetfulness of a possible discrepancy between, for
instance, his personal appearance and the sentiment or character he is
endeavouring to represent. But here, too, some discretion should be exercised.
A lady, for instance, weighing fourteen stone and a half should not, as
I have heard one do, put the audience's capacity for self-control to too severe
a test by singing baby-songs like, "Put me in my little bed, mother," or
"If nobody ever marries me and I don't know why he should." Yes, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">700</a></span>
the time of day, and the scene and the occasion should find a place among
the questions to be considered by a singer when choosing a song for performance,
as under circumstances the best interpretation may not only fail
to be appreciated, but even produce an effect utterly unlooked for.</p>

<p>It was many years ago, two or three nights after Gilbert and Sullivan's
incomparable <i>Mikado</i> had been launched on its triumphal career at the
Savoy, that there was a big evening party at Sullivan's flat, to have the honour
of meeting the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh. An excellent
little programme of music had been gone through, and just after midnight,
supper being over, the whole party once more repaired to the drawing-room
for some jollier things. Nearly all the principal singers from the Savoy had
come over in their <i>Mikado</i> costumes and, with the composer at the piano,
delighted the guests with excerpts like "Three little Maids from School"
and "The flowers that bloom in the Spring, tra-la," doubly fascinating then
on account of the novelty of the thing.</p>

<p>Everybody, and none the least so the two Royal guests, who occupied two
armchairs in front, with the programme in their hands, enjoyed the entertainment
to the utmost, and the fun was at its height when one of the guests,
a celebrated contralto, famous for her rendering of ballads&mdash;I mean the style
of ballads in vogue thirty-five years ago&mdash;was asked if she wouldn't sing one
of them. She, of course, readily consented, solemnly mounted the little platform,
and there was a hush as she stood there, motionless like a statue, her
face expressing a seriousness so strangely in contrast with the mirth and
laughter that had pervaded the room but a few minutes before, that I noticed
the two Royal programmes being brought somewhat nearer the Royal faces.
Then the accompanist struck the first chords of the introduction and&mdash;could
we really believe our ears?&mdash;the lady began to sing&mdash;you'll never guess&mdash;"<i>The
Three Fishers!</i>" Higher and higher up went the Royal programmes,
a dead silence reigned in the room until it came to the "Three Corpses,"
when, little by little, small noises like half-suppressed sneezes or sobs could
be heard here and there, increasing in frequency and volume, and when it
came to the refrain&mdash;it was now a little after 1 a.m.&mdash;"The sooner it's over
the sooner to sleep," the last "moa-oa-oa-ning" was drowned in a vociferous
applause of a character such as I am sure that ballad had never before evoked.</p>

<p>And now I should like to mention another factor in the rendering of music,
the importance of which is often underrated, and that is the <i>tempo</i>. Good
music, I have found, not only does not lose but rather gains by the <i>tempo</i>,
whatever it might be, being taken with deliberation. There are degrees in
any designation of time, and one is apt to forget that the Italian words in
common for that purpose may refer, not only to the metronomic measure,
but also to the character, the mood of a piece. Allegro means lively. But
there are degrees of liveliness. An elephant may be lively, but I take his
liveliness to be of a somewhat different kind from that, for instance, of the
frisky little chap whose antics are so deliciously and humorously described
in Goethe and Berlioz's immortal "Song of the Flea" in <i>Faust</i>. I remember<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">701</a></span>
once hearing Schubert's <i>Erlking</i> taken at such a break-neck speed that
I wondered both father and child were not killed before the end of the
first stanza. It reminded me of a rather amusing series of telegraphic versions
of celebrated poems, which many years ago appeared in the <i>Fliegende Blätter</i>&mdash;the
Continental <i>Punch</i>&mdash;and of which that of the <i>Erlking</i> might be
rendered in English by something like this: "Night wild&mdash;Father and child&mdash;Ride
through the dark&mdash;Erlking out for a lark&mdash;Boy frightened&mdash;Father's
grip tightened&mdash;Father, ride on&mdash;Yes, my son&mdash;Reach home in fear and
dread&mdash;Father alive, child dead."</p>

<p>When we recall the definition of the word Interpretation as it refers to
music and poetry, viz., Rendering by artistic representation or performance,
we shall find that that little qualification "artistic" makes all the difference
in the world, inasmuch as it clearly shows that a mere representation or
performance may not necessarily be an interpretation and that it requires
an artist to make it such. And it follows that there must be any amount of
variety in the interpretation of one and the same thing. An old Latin proverb
says: "Duo si faciunt idem, non est idem." When two people do the same
thing, it isn't the same thing. Well, if that be true in any undertaking, how
infinitely great must be the possibility of such variety when the two people
of the proverb are artists! For though we speak of the artistic temperament
as if it were something absolute and definable, we know in how many different
ways such a temperament may manifest itself.</p>

<p>There are no two painters who, put before the same landscape, would
paint it, <i>i.e.</i>, interpret it, in the same way. Neither, I maintain, are there two
actors who would interpret Hamlet, or two singers who would sing the same
song exactly alike. They each have, when they have attained maturity, their
own style, and style, as an eminent painter of the last century has admirably
expressed it, is the leaving out of everything superfluous, a definition which
fits our subject equally well. No two artists will think the same thing superfluous;
indeed, what the one considers so, the other may deem essential.
Here, too, the actor&mdash;to come back to poetry and music&mdash;is better off than
the musician. He has a far greater scope, <i>i.e.</i>, a far wider outlet for his imagination.
He is given the words to do what he likes with. One actor&mdash;to keep to
Hamlet&mdash;might after long study have come to the conclusion that, for instance,
the last lines of that fine monologue at the end of the second act should
be triumphantly exclaimed in a loud voice:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The play's the thing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Whilst another, equally eminent, would make an equally great impression
by almost whispering the words to himself, as if afraid of betraying the secret:
"The play's the thing...." Who could say of the one or the other interpretation
"This is right," or "This is wrong"? In this case the same result
is arrived at by different means. On the other hand, I remember a little
story my father told me when I was a boy, of a man who had been made very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">702</a></span>
angry by a letter from his son at the University asking him for money. In
that mood he is met by an old friend who asks him, "What's the matter?
Why are you thus out of sorts?" "Well," says the other, "look at this impertinent
letter I've just got from my son, 'Father, please send me money!'"&mdash;reading
out the words in a quick, impatient, commanding voice. "Of
course," he adds, "I shan't do anything of the kind."</p>

<p>"Let me see the letter," the benevolent friend asks&mdash;he was very fond of
the boy&mdash;and, reading the words with a gentle, pleading, affectionate inflexion
of the voice, he says, "Why, my dear fellow, it's a very charming
letter. He writes, 'Father, <i>please</i> send me money.'" "Ah," says the father,
"if he writes like that, he shall have it!" Here, without doubt, the different
interpretation had a different result. Certainly the son will have thought so.</p>

<p>Varieties such as just quoted are, however, quite impossible in music.
Here we are faced by absolute orders given by the composer who says:
"This is to be <i>forte</i>, this <i>piano</i>; here you must increase, there decrease;
here hurry, there retard." But this apparent clipping of the interpreter's
wings is only a blessing in disguise, for it makes it possible for even a singer
of inferior intelligence to render by artistic representation or performance,
<i>i.e.</i>, to interpret a song; so that, whilst we would not listen to a representation
of the character of Hamlet by a stupid or uneducated man, we may
thoroughly enjoy the rendering of a song by a singer with a fine voice, even if
he be a most uninteresting, commonplace person otherwise, <i>as long as he
masters the technique of his art and loyally and conscientiously follows the
directions given by the composer</i>.</p>

<p>A loyal, reverent attitude to the author is a thing on which too great stress
cannot be laid. A work deemed worth performing should be rendered as the
author wrote it. By this I do, of course, not mean that an orchestral work or
an organ fugue or a string quartet should not be played on the pianoforte.
Quite the contrary. Skilful transcriptions and arrangements are indeed
as great a boon as are reproductions of the famous masterpieces of painting
or sculpture, without which our knowledge of the art would be lamentably
defective. There have also been cases where one great master has thought
it desirable to complement the work of another, either by writing accompaniments
to originally unaccompanied instrumental works, as Schumann
did to Bach, or by strengthening the accompanying orchestra in a choral
work, as Mozart did to Handel's <i>Messiah</i>. As far as I know the original text
has in all such cases been allowed to remain intact; and works thus treated
being obtainable in the original as well as in the complemented version,
the choice is left to the personal taste of the musicians responsible for the performance.
What I mean is that the <i>text</i> of the composer should not be tampered
with. There have now and then attempts been made at improving
Beethoven's scores on the plea that some instruments employed by the
master&mdash;like, for instance, the flute&mdash;have been developed so as to allow
notes to be played on them now which were impossible at the time Beethoven
wrote, and that very likely, had these notes been at the master's disposal, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">703</a></span>
would have made use of them. This may or may not be so, but it seems to
me a dangerous theory to work upon, for once you commence meddling
with a master work it would be difficult to know where to draw the line, and
there is no saying whither it would lead. Besides, every great period in the
history of art has its own characteristics. A so-called full orchestra in
Beethoven's time was a very different thing from what we are accustomed
to consider one to-day, when woodwind, brass, percussion, harps, and what
not often alone outnumber the entire personnel of a grand orchestra a
century ago. Moreover, if you leave Beethoven's scores untouched, his
mastery of orchestration becomes all the more wonderful. There are instances&mdash;just
think of that glorious climax in the Third <i>Leonora</i> Overture, or the
end of that to <i>Egmont</i>&mdash;where, even considering only the mere physical
power of sound, he gets results from his orchestration that no modern writer
has as yet surpassed.</p>

<p>It is hardly credible that, arrogant enough as such attempts at improving
Beethoven's orchestration are, there exist people who go further still and
actually alter a great composer's directions as to expression. Most of us know
how particularly fond Beethoven was of interrupting a seemingly increasing
<i>fortissimo</i> by a sudden <i>pianissimo</i>. You will recall that splendid <i>scherzo</i> in
the "Seventh Symphony," where he commences with an exultant <i>fortissimo</i>,
evidently meaning to continue in that vein, when all of a sudden the <i>ft</i> on
the last crotchet of the second bar is followed by a <i>pp</i> on the first crotchet
of the third, the result is simply marvellous.</p>

<p>Well, some years ago I had to conduct that symphony as a deputy for the
regular conductor, who was prevented from being at his post on that
occasion. Can you imagine my surprise and disgust when, at the rehearsal,
commencing with the Scherzo, and looking forward to that sudden <i>pp</i> on
the first note of the third bar, that <i>pp</i> appeared already on the last note of
the second bar, which should have still been <i>ft</i>. Stopping the orchestra
indignantly, I asked, "What on earth are you doing, gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"We have got it so in our parts," was the answer. "Impossible," I said.
"Let me see!" The leader handed me the part, and there, to be sure, I was
flabbergasted to find the mark of <i>pp</i> on the first note of the third bar actually
transferred in blue pencil to the preceding note, thus not only completely
spoiling Beethoven's fun, but altering and weakening the subject, which, as
anybody might see, commences with the down, not the up beat. I wonder
if one should envy a man or pity him for a degree of self-estimation which
could render him capable of blue-pencilling Beethoven!</p>

<p>He certainly has arrived at what a witty American friend of mine would
call the "Shoehorn stage." To my enquiries about a mutual acquaintance,
that gentleman answered, "He? Why, he's that big now he has to <i>use a
shoehorn to put on his hat</i>!"</p>

<p>But this is by no means an isolated example of the lamentable lack of
reverence in this country toward the works of the great masters of music.
However much one might be horrified at the utterly mistaken <i>tempi</i> one
often has to listen to in the rendering of the classics, especially Mozart and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">704</a></span>
Beethoven, that, after all, sad and deplorable as it is, may only be the consequence
of ignorance or the result of insufficient musical training on the
part of the performer. It is the wanton, deliberate tampering with the <i>text</i>
of a great composer which is unpardonable. No one among the classics was
more explicit or exacting as to the way he wished his works to be rendered
than Beethoven. Take once more that surpassingly beautiful <i>Leonora</i> Overture
No. III. Who has not been thrilled to the innermost depths of his soul by
those distant trumpet-calls, each ending with a long pause on the last note,
and followed immediately, <i>i.e.</i>, <i>without any further pause and whilst that last
note still lingers in one's ears</i>, by one of the most divinely inspired phrases
ever penned by even that great master? After the first call the orchestra
plays it, in a mysterious <i>pianissimo</i>, in the same key as the call itself&mdash;B flat;
after the second, more impressive still, a third lower, in G flat. Well, at a
recent performance of that great work the conductor, according to the
papers an "acknowledged authority" on Beethoven, coolly added a "general
pause" on to each of those two pauses on the last note of the trumpet-call;
that after the second call lasting for fully ten seconds. No words can express
my disappointment, my indignation, for, of course, the sublime beauty of
that low G flat with which the double-basses and 'celli enter <i>whilst the high
B flat of the trumpet-call is slowly dying away</i> in the distance was lost completely.
Indeed it would have mattered little now in <i>what</i> key the orchestra
had come in&mdash;the thing was irretrievably spoiled.</p>

<p>Anywhere on the Continent the audience would have given unmistakable
signs of their disapproval, and the Press been unanimous in the condemnation
of such practices on the part of the conductor. Here that gentleman
was vociferously applauded by the audience and&mdash;with, I think, one solitary
exception&mdash;lauded to the skies by the Press, the one or two papers which
were bold enough to timidly admit his "occasionally taking liberties with
Beethoven" declaring such liberties to be those of "an intimate, an adept."</p>

<p>Intimate indeed! If a hundred years ago an intimate of Beethoven's had
dared to do such a thing in Beethoven's presence, the master, as we know
him from his letters, would have flung the score at his head, thundering,
"Knave, canst thou not read? Dost thou think if I had wanted those two
general pauses, I did not know how to put them in my score?"</p>

<p>What are we coming to? Irreverence, contempt of traditions, breaking
with a glorious past, disregard of law, of form&mdash;are they also in the realm
of music a sign of the times, a sort of Bolshevism?</p>

<p>Fancy an actor, tired of that everlasting "To be or not to be," and thinking
it too hackneyed, surprising the audience by commencing the great monologue
for a change with "To exist or not to exist"; or another, going one
better, and considering the absence of rhyme in that monologue rather a
mistake of Shakespeare's, hitting on the happy and original idea of correcting
it into something like:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To be or not to be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is what staggers me.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">And yet that would not be one whit less of a sacrilege.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">705</a></span>
And take a song or an aria; how often does one not hear even good singers
change a note into a higher one, with the object of showing the voice to
better advantage, or of making a phrase, generally the final cadence, more
effective, so as to get a few more handfuls of applause, or perhaps even an
additional recall at the end?</p>

<p>"That's villainous," says Hamlet, "and shows a most pitiful ambition."</p>

<p>This altering of notes brings me upon a question which has ever been the
subject of much controversy among musicians: Are there any rules as to
the singing of recitatives or, rather, to the substituting now and then, in
the singing of recitatives of notes other than those written by the composer?
Should, for instance, the phrase in the <i>Messiah</i></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 596px;"><img src="images/i713a.jpg" width="596" height="174" alt="Music" /><br /></div>

<p class="in0">My answer as regards the first of these two examples is as decided a "No"
as my "Yes" is in regard to the second. This may, perhaps, be considered
somewhat arbitrary and entirely a matter of taste, but I venture to hope that
after what I have to say on the subject it will be found to be only partly
a matter of taste, and of arbitrariness not at all. I base my objection to the
alteration in the first, and my approval of that in the second example on a
theory which seems to me to commend itself by its simplicity, and may be
explained in the shape of a rule something like this:</p>

<p>Take the note as to the changing of which into a higher or lower you are
in doubt, and look first at the note <i>preceding</i> and then at the note <i>following</i>
that doubtful note. Then see if the note you wish to substitute for the printed
note lies on the way from the preceding to the following note. If it does, you are
justified in making the change; if not, leave it alone. Here is our first example:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 154px;"><img src="images/i713b.jpg" width="154" height="76" alt="Music" /><br /></div>

<p class="in0">The doubtful note is the C on "shep," the preceding
one is the G below, the following is the C. Now, does
the D you wish to substitute for the C on "shep" lie
between that "G" and that "C" on the second
syllable of shepherd? No, let the phrase therefore
remain as written. In the second example:</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 201px;"><img src="images/i713c.jpg" width="201" height="79" alt="Music" /><br /></div>

<p class="in0">The questionable note is the A on "Da"
and <i>does</i> lie on the way from the C sharp to
the A on the second syllable of David; it is,
therefore, not only perfectly legitimate, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">706</a></span>
even good to make the change, and the phrase should be sung:</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 72px;"><img src="images/i714a.jpg" width="72" height="56" alt="Music" /><br /></div>

<p class="in0">The question of taste enters when it comes to the exception
to the rule. According to that it would be legitimate, taking
yet a third example from the <i>Messiah</i>:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 498px;"><img src="images/i714b.jpg" width="498" height="69" alt="Music" /><br /></div>

<p class="in0">In this case, however, it would be decidedly better to leave the phrase unchanged,
for we have had four B flats already in that short sentence, and the
A, coming pat on the F major chord, is rather relieving and refreshing. Here,
as in many other cases, "let your own discretion be your tutor." Of an exception
to the rule as regards the first of these three examples being either
justifiable or advisable I know no instance. Of course, all I have said on this
subject refers to the slow, deliberate, serious recitative in oratorio and other
sacred music only, and not at all to what is called "secco" recitative in
opera, which is practically no more than speech somewhat rapidly delivered
in specified musical terms. There you should change the doubtful note into
one above or below it at every opportunity, for by doing so you impart
a certain spontaneity and freedom to the sentences, emphasising their resemblance
to the spoken word. Here is an example in the style of Mozart:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><img src="images/i714c.jpg" width="350" height="230" alt="Music" /><br /></div>

<p>But I am reaching the limit of the space allowed for this article and fear my
chat has been on "kindred topics" rather than on the alleged main theme of
interpretation. But surely none of my readers expected me to answer the
question "How to Interpret"? If so, I should be as truly sorry for having disappointed
them as I was some years ago to have been obliged to disillusion
the organist of the little Parish Church of Alvie. I don't mean myself, for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">707</a></span>
only officiated there in that capacity during the summer months, when I
was at home. I mean the regular, appointed, salaried, real organist. She was a
young girl of sixteen, a native of the parish, who, fond of music, like all Scots
people, could strum two or three tunes on the piano, and to whom I had
given a few lessons in the managing of the American organ in the church.
At the request of my old friend, the Rev. James Anderson, our late and much
lamented minister, I had introduced the playing of a voluntary during
collection, always, of course, improvising on the Psalm or hymn tunes of
the day's service, or on whatever came into my head. Well, a week after I
had left Alvie for London, the first year of that innovation, I received a letter
from the young lady, consisting of the following five lines: "Dear Mr.
Henschel&mdash;Mr. Anderson wishes me to play voluntaries during collection,
just as you did. Would you please let me know how you do it?"</p>

<p>I was touched by so much faith and innocence. The playing of an instrument&mdash;and
singing, as such, is but playing on the vocal instrument in our
throats&mdash;may be taught and, with patience and perseverance, brought to
as near a degree of perfection as humanly possible; that is a matter of craft,
of physical, I may say muscular, skill. The mystery of what is best, imperishable
in any art, lies in the soul and in the brain. If dormant, it may be
awakened and fostered; if absent, it cannot be acquired by teaching.
Interpretation, though but recreative, certainly is an art, or at least part of
one. And art is long and life is short, and of learning there is no end.</p>

<p>To have a chance of becoming an artist in the true sense of the word,
the student, fortunate in the possession of the heavenly gift of talent,
should from the outset resolve to strive for none but the highest ideals,
refuse to be satisfied, both in taking and giving, with anything but the
best and purest, and last, though by no means least, resist the temptations
which the prospect of popularity and its worldly advantages,
frequently the result of lowering that high standard, may place in his way.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">MR.</span> Bridges's new volume of poems (the first that he has
published since he became Poet Laureate) must be read for
what it is, the work of a man seventy-five years of age. This
statement is not made as an excuse: there are weak&mdash;occasional
and patriotic&mdash;poems in the book, but some also which are beautiful additions
to his canon. But some of his critics, so inadequate is still the recognition
of what he has done, have treated the book as though his claim to be a great
poet rested partly upon it, failing to read it, as they should, in the light of
all that has gone before it. Properly regarded, it awakes not disappointment,
but wonder that a poet so old should still sometimes have the genuine
impulse, should still keep his spirit fresh, and should still be capable of
ingenious and fruitful experiments in technique&mdash;experiments moreover
in which the content is never subordinated to the form, however exacting
and interesting the form may be. <i>October</i>, <i>Noel</i>, <i>Our Lady</i>, <i>Flycatchers</i>,
<i>The West Front</i>, <i>Trafalgar Square</i>, and <i>Fortunatus Nimium</i> are all poems that
any man might be proud to write in his prime; and beyond these there is
the delicious invention of <i>The Flowering Tree</i>:</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">709</a></span>
The occasion may suitably be seized to make a few notes on Mr. Bridges's
shorter&mdash;never mind the title and the word "lyrical"&mdash;poems as a
whole.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>Mr. Bridges is often written of as though he were primarily a technician.
He has always taken a keen interest in prosody; he has written books, and
formulated theories, about it; his experiments in classical metres and his
notions about English spelling have, to those who have not troubled to
discover the intellectual strength and the strong common sense which
commonly marks his linguistic writings, given him something of the air of
a pedant. But the theoriser and the innovator of the "shorter poems" has
nothing to do with pedantry. There are poems in which the scrutinous
eye may detect very elaborate pains. <i>April</i> 1885 is a fabric of internal rhyme,
assonance, and alliteration which it would be hard to parallel in English:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wanton with long delay the gay Spring leaping cometh;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blackthorn starreth now his bough on the eve of May:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All day in the sweet box-tree the bee for pleasure hummeth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cuckoo sends afloat his note on the air all day.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now dewy nights again and rain in gentle shower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At root of tree and flower have quenched the winter's drouth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On high the hot sun smiles, and banks of cloud uptower<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In bulging heads that crowd for miles the dazzling south.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">That may be called a <i>tour-de-force</i>; as a rule, though Mr. Bridges's variety
of stanza and rhythm is immense, the craftsman never intrudes. His ingenuities
merely serve their purpose; his music cannot be separated from
his sense; his rhythms are sought, and found, as the only suitable rhythms
for the words and the scenes that are being expressed and described. How
otherwise than in the beautiful movement used can we imagine the picture
of <i>A Passer By</i>?&mdash;the fresh blue day, the crowded sail, the vision of a queenly
progress across the world to a far harbour in the south? It is one of fifty
such feats, triumphs of fastidious art, never completely understood until
the poems are read aloud. His power of music has developed steadily
throughout his career, but scarcely a poem of any period can be quoted
without illustrating his surpassing technical gifts. We shall come to many
presently; here, when we are thinking primarily of the skill with which
he weaves a close-fitting garment of sound for his thought, we may take as
a single example, <i>London Snow</i>:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When men were all asleep the snow came flying,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In large white flakes falling on the city brown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stealthily and perpetually settling and loosely lying,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hushing the latest traffic of the drowsy town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deadening, muffling, stifling its murmurs failing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lazily and incessantly floating down and down:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Silently sifting and veiling road, roof, and railing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiding difference, making unevenness even,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into angles and crevices softly drifting and sailing.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">710</a></span>
<span class="i2">All night it fell, and when full inches seven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It lay in the depth of its uncompacted lightness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clouds blew off from a high and frosty heaven....<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The accuracy of the description is extraordinary and continues as the town
awakes, and boys go snowballing to school, a few carts creak along, and the
pale sun rises to awake the noisier day. But the observation, the accuracy,
the response of the heart to the beauty of the scene, might have been found
elsewhere: the astonishing management of the rhythms, which, even when
divorced from the meaning of the words, translate the steady falling, the
wayward criss-crossing, the lightness and crispness, and soothing persistence
of snow in an almost windless air, is peculiar to Mr. Bridges. Words and
music are with him always inseparable: he is at the opposite pole from the
man, often not unintelligent in other ways, who forces his material into a
strait-jacket of jingle. In this respect his taste is as flawless, his subtlety
as unfailing, as any in the records of literature.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>It is possible, and it has often been stated, that Mr. Bridges will chiefly
live as a poet of the English landscape. Certainly he would live if only his
landscape poetry were preserved. It may seem a large assertion, but no
Englishman has written so large a body of good landscape poetry. There
are two obvious things to be said about it.</p>

<p>The first is that his landscape is the landscape of the South of England,
more particularly of the Thames Valley and the downs by the sea&mdash;two
regions which he significantly chooses as typical, when, in <i>The Voice of
Nature</i>, he wishes to point an argument. He never describes foreign or remote
scenes; and&mdash;it may be regarded as symbolic of his attitude to the more
violent things of life&mdash;he never leaves the land for the sea. Even British
territorial waters he never sails; there is much of the sea in his work, but
it is the sea as seen from the shore, blue and smiling and dancing, or whipped
by the wind, caught in a narrow peep between shoulders of the downs or
watched from a hill through a telescope:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There many an hour I have sat to watch; nay, now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brazen disk is cold against my brow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in my sight a circle of the sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enlarged to swiftness, where the salt waves flee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ships in stately motion pass so near<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That what I see is speaking to my ear.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Mr. Bridges's landscape is bounded by the English Channel; his hills are
the Downs; his rivers are clear and gentle streams; his trees oak and beech,
elm and larch; he is as surely of the South of England as Wordsworth is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">711</a></span>
of the North. And the second obvious thing is that, being a true landscape
poet and not a romantic who exploits nature to find backgrounds for his
passions, it is of ordinary landscapes that he writes. Tennyson, too, was
an observer, but many of his best-known landscapes are of the selected kind.
It is one thing to write of the sort of natural scene traditionally approved as
remarkable: sunset on a marsh, sunrise on the Alps, stupendous cliffs,
high cataracts, and breakers in the moon. It is another to describe, giving
the breath of life to your description, what any man, going out on any day
in any season, will see when he looks over a five-barred gate or takes a footpath
through the woods. Mr. Bridges writes of nature like a countryman.
His abnormal scenes are rare; he sees the beauty in the normal. He sings
of nightingales when he hears them, but rooks are far more frequent in his
verse; his suns seldom go down in flaming splendour, but drop red into
the grey or die invisibly. One by one scenes from his familiar landscape
have moved him to verse, until his books contain a complete catalogue of the
English rural year, all its ordinary recurrent colours, and scents and sounds,
trees, flowers, birds, skies and waters.</p>

<p>Spring. A village in the downs, and men winnowing in a barn. The palm-willows
and hazels. The first flowers, primroses and green hyacinth spikes,
shooting up amid moss and withered undergrowth. Brisk ploughmen.
Birds happily courting in the jocund sun.</p>

<p>Summer. The garden, with bees on the flowers and in the overhanging
limes, and rooks cawing in the elms. The hayfields in the sun; fields
green with waves of rustling wheat; the hum of insects and the song of
larks in a sky pure blue, or heaped with "slow pavilions of caverned
snow," "sunshot palaces of cloud"; the downs, starred with small flowers,
where rabbits nibble the grass; the noise of scythes. The river: still water,
the dip of oars, a boat that glides with its reflection past flowering islets and
dipping branches and meadows, where "the lazy cows wrench many a
scented flower"; bathers; fish leaping in the pools; the peace of evening
as it falls over water and trees; moonlight on the flashing weir. There are
storms that blacken the sea and beat down the corn, but they pass and
the sun comes out again, gathering strength.</p>

<p>Autumn. The garden in September, with late flowers. The ripe orchards
and fields where "the sun spots the deserted gleanings with decay." The
winds of October that come and fill ruts and pools with golden leaves. The
later storms that mingle the leaves with snow.</p>

<p>Winter. The short days and the infrequent sun on lonely songless lands.
Rooks after the plough, the team against the skyline. A rough sea and snow
on the beach. Robin on the leafless bough. Dark afternoons and evenings
by the fire, companioned or alone.</p>

<p>All those signs of the seasons and hundreds more could be illustrated
from Mr. Bridges. One cannot do more here than huddle together a few
characteristic fragments from which the whole may be deduced. If the
first three are records of the shape, colour and movement of clouds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">712</a></span>
it is fitting: all Mr. Bridges's landscapes have skies, and most of his skies
(being English) have clouds:</p>

<p class="in0">The best of all (such as <i>The Downs</i> and <i>The Storm is Over</i>) cannot be
quoted except entirely; they are landscapes complete, earth and sky. But
let it not be supposed that Mr. Bridges is ever a mere describer who sits
down mechanically in front of any scene with his little box of water-colours.
We have known such, and sometimes they have been learned in botany;
their exactitude of detail is dull, their serried statements useless; only the
man who is touched by the beauty in a scene, or aroused by a scene to an
awareness of beauty behind it, will fuse the several things he sees into a
whole. The writer who has felt no emotion communicates none, and the
greatness of Mr. Bridges's poems of landscape is derived not solely from his
knowledge of landscape, the wary eye, but from his feeling for it, the eye of
love. His scenes are precise, but they are never photographs; there is no
doubt about the sentiment that he felt when he saw them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">714</a></span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>And Mr. Bridges, even when at his best, is not only a landscape poet, but
a poet cunning in the experiences of the heart. Very many of his poems are
love poems and many of them are beautiful: if the fact has not been widely
observed it must be because they are happy love poems, or at least because
they are not excessive in expression. The proclivity that makes him, in
another sphere, write not about storms but about calms after storms, is
seen always: he has no violence, no vehement abandonment. But there is
little of that in Wordsworth and other poets the depth of whose affections,
the reality of whose suffering, cannot be doubted. Mr. Bridges's love-poetry
makes no brutal assault on us. His constant reference to Virgil, Mozart and
the old composers is significant. He never declaims, never raves, despairs, or
burns in print: but he knows the ways of lovers' hearts, and his quiet stanzas,
whether their subject be the pain of doubt, or separation, or the joy of
union, or calm affection by the warm domestic hearth, have a truth and
strength which outwear the ardours of many poets. In <i>When My Love was
Away</i>, <i>My Spirit sang all day</i>, <i>I will not let thee go</i>, and twenty more he
lover's calendar is written as that of the seasons elsewhere, and if his praise
is soft and measured like the old music in which he so constantly delights,
love's fine extravagance is, for all the tempered sound, nevertheless there:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her beauty would surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Gazers on Autumn eves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who watched the broad moon rise<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon the scattered sheaves.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">He is self-controlled and never shouts; he does not hunt the universe for
new and strange sorrows nor harrow himself overmuch with the problems
of existence; but those griefs that fall to the common lot of mankind have
come to him and drawn beautiful poetry from him. Many poets have written
habitually of Death; few have said as little about Death as Mr. Bridges;
but he has said all he has to say and need say about death, loss, and sorrow
in two poems, the poem which begins:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I never shall love the snow again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since Maurice died,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">and the other <i>On a Dead Child</i>: "Perfect little body, without fault or stain
on thee...."</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So I lay thee there, thy sunken eyelids closing&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Go lie thou there in thy coffin, thy last little bed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Propping thy wise, sad head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy firm, pale hands across thy chest disposing.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So quiet! doth the change content thee?&mdash;Death, whither hath he taken thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To a world, do I think, that rights the disaster of this?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The vision of which I miss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who weep for the body, and wish but to warm thee and awaken thee?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah! little at best can all our hopes avail us<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">715</a></span>
<span class="i4">To lift this sorrow, or cheer us, when in the dark,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Unwilling, alone we embark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the things we have seen and have known and have heard of, fail us.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">In <i>Winter Nightfall</i> there is all the complaint of ailing old age, in <i>Pater
Filio</i> the passionate anxiety of parent for child; the normal, inevitable
griefs and dejections are all here, expressed with gravity, yet always with
poignancy. But normal and inevitable they are. One gets the impression that,
beyond the "common lot," the poet has had few distresses. Intense joy&mdash;nobody
has given it better definition than he&mdash;is as rare as intense sadness,
but ordinarily he is happy, or at worst not uncomfortably melancholy, and
the happiness has become more pervasive as he has grown older. He is the
poet of a leisured country life, led by a sensitive physically healthy man,
with whom the major things of life have gone well and who, in those circumstances,
is temperamentally inclined to a grateful contentment.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Mr. Bridges has not made the easy appeal by violence of expression; and
he has not made the easy appeal by violence of doctrine. If he has been
less discussed than many inferior writers, it is not so much that he is without
doctrine as that he is without novel doctrine and has never been a doctrinaire.
Any noisy demonstrator with a new lie may attract attention, if it is only
the attention of those who wish to dispute with him; and it is easier to
dispute (or agree) with the man whose "views" are explicit than with him
who leaves them implicit. The mere fact that Mr. Bridges's practical philosophy
has been held by hundreds of millions of ordinary people in many
ages does not prove that he has no philosophy. He is a Christian, but he says
little about that. He is politically sceptical of systems, but he says little about
that. He accepts life, with its pains and pleasures, and he is happy that his
life has been cast in an ordered traditional civilisation. He sees life in proportion,
with the greater goods clear: childhood, the love of a woman and
of children, the beauty of the earth, days of peace, joyful work, friendship.
He does not proclaim a way of life, but it will be easy for his critics to deduce
one from his poetry: if he does not tell people how to enjoy life it is because
he is too busy enjoying it himself, and if he does not expound his religion,
it is because he probably holds it to be "the religion of all sensible men."
He never loses hold of his settled philosophy. In depression he does not
imaginatively revel in the gloom of a Universe gone black, but consoles
himself out of his knowledge:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O soul, be patient: thou shalt find<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A little matter mend all this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some strain of music to thy mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some praise for skill not spent amiss.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">716</a></span></p>
<p>In the peace of a churchyard he can write:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nay, were my last hope quenched, I here would sit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And praise the annihilation of the pit.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">He lives through the moments of dejection and awaits, with sure hope, those
moments when</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Life and joy are one&mdash;we know not why&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though our very blood long breathless lain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had tasted of the breath of God again.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">There are times when he is at almost that pitch of bliss for days together,
and he says with each evening:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That I have known no day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all my life like this.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">And with any dawn may come the exhilaration and the resolve</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I too will something make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joy in the making.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">Very rarely some slight dogmatic statement is actually present, the affirmation
of something which is not necessarily false because it is as old as man,
and modestly put. "For howso'er man hug his care, The best of his art is gay."
He sees Spring in Winter more often than Winter in Spring:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And God the Maker doth my heart make bold<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To praise for writing works not understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who all the worlds and ages doth behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Evil and good as one, and all as good.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It may by some be called an easy acceptance; by others the answer will be
made that the refusal to accept does not get us much further. Mr. Bridges's
own answer would perhaps be Lycomedes':</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">men who would live well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weigh not these riddles, but unfold their life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From day to day.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>No attempt has been made in these brief notes to do more than indicate
the artistic virtues and the outlook of Mr. Bridges: the elucidation is scant
enough, and there was no space for reasoned criticism or for discussion of
the qualities which he lacks and which other poets have possessed. But it
may, in conclusion, be repeated that he is, as an artist, as careful and skilful
as any poet who has ever written, and that as a man he has never lied, never
posed, never assumed a factitious mood because it might impress or a factitious
opinion because it might startle. He <i>is</i> sensible, and he is (in the best
sense) commonplace in his outlook and in his affections and admirations; the
changing conditions of our times have affected him little; he thinks more of
the "man harrowing clods" than of the "breaking of nations"; the river,
the cornfields, the village church, the domestic fireside, do obscure for him
the mental and physical struggles of our world; he has his ideal of the sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">717</a></span>
mind in the sound body, and he cannot see why anything should modify it.
But his philosophy will not stale when many of our controversialists have
gone the way of Godwin and Malthus; and a reader who went to him for
knowledge of how to live would certainly not be led on the rocks, little as
Mr. Bridges may directly say on the subject. Nobody could be less like an
apostle, but serenity, delight, cleanliness, and honesty are in him&mdash;and
courage. The thought of death does not appal him, it braces him to work
and joy. "Man hath his life," says Thetis in one of his dramas, "that
it must end condemns it not for naught." The same certainty is in the
lyrics:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Daily thy life shortens, the grave's dark peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Draweth surely nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When good-night is good-bye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the sleeping shall not cease.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fight, to be found fighting: nor far away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deem, nor strange thy doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like this sorrow 'twill come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the day will be to-day.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The greatest of practical truths could not be put more stoutly, nor with a
finer imaginative touch.</p>

<h3 class="left">MR. YATES THOMPSON'S ILLUMINATED BOOKS</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THESE</span> lines are written before the date at which the second portion of Mr.
Yates Thompson's illuminated books are to be sold at Sotheby's. They have
no reference therefore to the relative value of the books as realised under
the hammer. The intrinsic value of books, however, should not be measured
merely by their market price. Splendid as are the French and Italian
manuscripts and the eight printed books which are included in the sale, the greatest
interest of all has its centre in the fourteen books which show the gay piety of English
illumination between the last quarter of the twelfth century and the middle of the
fifteenth. Indeed, no other group in all the hundred books to which Mr. Yates Thompson
definitely limited his famous collection has quite the same claims of artistic and historical
interest as these. They do not, of course, cover the whole range of English illumination.
There is no example of the art of outline drawing, which flourished with amazing vigour
in England for a century and a half before the Norman Conquest, convicting Mr. G. K.
Chesterton of inexactitude when, in a recent number of <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>, he
suggests that mediæval illuminators used their paints before they had learned how to
draw. The vivacity and grace shown in those early drawings, chastened but not subdued
by Continental and Byzantine influences, left traces in English books, and continued to
afford a firm groundwork for English illumination for more than three centuries. There
are but few examples of them in private hands. Neither has Mr. Yates Thompson any
example of the great Winchester School, represented in the tenth century by the
Benedictional of St. Æthelwold, now the property of the Duke of Devonshire, and in
the twelfth by the great Bible at Winchester Cathedral. But English art had its flowering
time in the fourteenth century, and its late summer in the fifteenth; and amongst the
books offered for sale at Sotheby's are brilliant examples of both these periods.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Taking the more important of these English books in the order of their date, we have
first the <i>Life of St. Cuthbert</i>, with its series of fifty-six lovely full-page miniatures,
probably painted at Durham about 1180, a delightful example of a rare type of book.
<i>The Apocalypse</i> has an important chapter to itself in the history of painted books, and
the late thirteenth-century copy in the collection is one of the finest surviving copies of
that favourite picture-book of the Middle Ages. It has much in common with the copy
at Lambeth, and Dr. M. R. James traces them both to the same birthplace, probably
St. Augustine's at Canterbury. The copy in the sale has no less than 152 miniatures,
some of which seem to have been painted in Italy, whence more than six centuries later
Mr. Yates Thompson brought it back to England.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The three fourteenth-century manuscripts in the group are a Psalter of Northern
origin, probably written for a member of the Yorkshire family of de la Twyere; an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">719</a></span>
early Sarum Missal, with historiated initials, in which some of the figure-drawing
recalls that of Queen Mary's <i>Psalter</i> in the British Museum; and the <i>Psalter</i> of John
of Gaunt, to whom it is believed to have been given, perhaps on his marriage with
Blanche of Lancaster in 1359. Many of the miniatures in this splendid book are
enshrined in Gothic canopies and painted in gold and silver; and the silver, so apt to turn
black through oxydization, has on most of these pages kept its lustre. This <i>Psalter</i> is
one of the finest examples of English work which has survived from the second half of
the fourteenth century. Mr. Yates Thompson confesses that it cost him a bigger price
than any other of his books.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The <i>Hours of Elisabeth y<sup>e</sup> Quene</i>, so called from the signature of the Queen of
Henry VII. written at the foot of one of the pages, is a very rich and beautiful
example of that new spirit in English illumination which has been connected with
the marriage of Queen Anne of Bohemia to King Richard II. in 1382. Dating from
that event, English work for almost the first time takes a character which is quite
distinct from contemporary French or Flemish illumination, and the change is
attributed to the work and influence of the artists whom the Bohemian princess brought
in her train. The strong, clear outline, made by pen or pencil, which had been a
tradition from the beginning of English pictorial art, now yields place to soft brushwork.
The human figure, which has hitherto been represented by types, assumes
individuality and realism. There is found, too, a new character in portraiture, with the
features carefully and delicately moulded. The rich borders of books of this period
have details unknown in the French work, which, hitherto, has been so nearly akin to
that done in England. The kinship can be traced rather to contemporary books painted
in Italy and Southern Germany. These English borders are apt to have a certain
heaviness in design, especially when compared with the graceful ivy-leaf pattern
in French illumination of the same date. Thanks, however, to the greater brilliancy
and gaiety of the colouring, which is also a note of the new English style, this heaviness
in design is hardly felt. In this <i>Book of Hours</i> the colours, which for the most part are
delicate shades of red and blue, heightened with white, and richly gilt, are especially
brilliant. The class of illumination which it represents belongs to a limited and
distinct period of English art which has yet to be fully explored.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The group of eight books printed on vellum which follows the English books in the
order of lots, and in the catalogue is sandwiched between them and the French and
Italian manuscripts, is quite worthy of such good company. These printed books show
how deliberately and how successfully the first printers sought to copy the manner and
also the special beauty of the finest manuscripts of their own age. Amongst these fine
volumes are the Mainz <i>de Officiis</i> of 1466; Peter Schoeffer's <i>Justinian</i> of 1468; an
illuminated copy of Jenson's <i>Pliny</i> of 1472&mdash;the type of which had so notable an influence
on the work of the Kelmscott and Doves Presses; John of Verona's <i>Valturius</i> of 1472,
the earliest book to be printed in Italy with Italian woodcuts&mdash;and this copy is illuminated
too. The group shows how far from vain even in an artistic sense was the boast made in
the colophon of one of the earliest Venetian printers that already by his new craft</p>

<h3 class="left">GENERAL NOTES</h3>

<p>Messrs. Dobell's catalogue for March, 1920, contains mention of a very curious and
beautiful book of designs made exclusively of feathers. There are about one hundred
and fifty of these designs, which were made, according to the inscription on the title-page,
by "Dionisio Minaggio Giardinero Di s<sup>a</sup> e<sup>a</sup> Guobernator Del Stat di Milano.
Inventor et Feccit Lano Del 1618." His Excellency the Governor of the State of Milan
was fortunate in possessing so talented a gardener. Dionisio Minaggio was, in his way,
a remarkable artist. His feather pictures, which include a beautiful series of birds
portrayed in their own plumage, a series of hunting scenes, illustrations of musical
instruments, and a number of charming figures from the Old Comedy, are often quite
enchanting. The designs are reminiscent of the best sampler work, while the feathers
give a richness, variety, and unexpectedness of colouring such as no sampler has ever
possessed. Feather work of a much later period is not uncommon; but we should
imagine that so large a series of such an early date is something quite unique. The book
is priced at £200.</p>

<p>The catalogue of the library of Mr. Walter Thomas Wallace, which is to be sold in
the last days of March by the American Art Association, in New York, has just reached
us. Mr. Wallace's astonishingly rich collection includes copies of the four Folios of
Shakespeare and of several of the Quartos. Among the Elizabethan rarities are <i>The
Palace of Pleasure</i>, Sidney's <i>Arcadia</i>, <i>The Faerie Queene</i>, and other poems of Spenser.
Among the eighteenth-century treasures is to be found one of the two known copies of
Goldsmith's <i>Threnodia Augustalis</i>. Keats and Shelley are well represented. There is a
very complete collection of Tennyson first editions and an almost unique series of Lamb
books, including a copy in the original binding of the almost extinct first edition of
<i>Poems for Children</i> (1809). There are also remarkably complete sets of first editions of
such American authors as Poe, Bryant, Longfellow. We anticipate some new records
in the way of prices.</p>

<p>As we go to press the first reports of the beginning of the Buxton Forman sale at the
Anderson Galleries, New York, reach us. They emphasize the present flourishing condition
of what the late owner of the books in question once, in an unguarded moment,
called "The Keats and Shelley" business. Two copies of books by Keats, which
belonged to Fanny Braune (afterwards Mrs. Lindon), were included in the first day's
sale. The <i>Poems</i> (1817), inscribed with her name, "Frances Lindon," and presumed
to be a presentation copy from the poet, and a first edition of <i>Lamia</i>, <i>Isabella</i>, <i>The Eve
of St. Agnes</i>, etc. (1820), inscribed on the title-page "to F. B. from J. K." These two
books fetched $1750 and $4000, and, at the normal rate of exchange, £350 and £800
respectively. Even a series of eighteen letters from George Keats sold for $1800.
Apparently it is better to be a poet's brother than oneself a poet, for an eight-page autograph
manuscript of William Blake's poem <i>Genesis</i>, which is still unpublished, was
bought by the Rosenbach Company, of Philadelphia, for $1350.</p>

<div class="tb">*<span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Other items in this sale were Browning's <i>Pauline</i>, first edition (1833), an uncut copy
with the original boards and paper label intact ($2560) and the MS. of <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>,
title and fifty-nine folio pages ($1200). Eight hundred dollars, normally the equivalent
of £160, was the price paid for a copy of the first edition of <i>Adam Bede</i> (1859), presented
by George Eliot to Thackeray.</p>

<h3>AMERICAN COPYRIGHT</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I trust you will find room to insert this letter after the space you have given to
Mr. G. H. Putnam. We are all grateful for the work that Mr. Putnam has done, but&mdash;to
use an American phrase, which no doubt he will appreciate&mdash;"there are others"
who have worked equally hard, and not infrequently with a more satisfactory result.
We must thank you, therefore, for your brief Editorial Note in the March issue.</p>

<p>The real reason, however, for this letter is to correct some of the statements made by
Mr. Putnam. He glorifies the new American Act because of its liberal allowance of
120 days' "interim" copyright. He has understated his own case. The Act gives sixty
days from the publication abroad in which to deposit a copy at Washington, and four
months from the date of deposit in which to take up the copyright, subject to the
numerous harassing technicalities of the Act. An author, therefore, has 180 instead of
120 days.</p>

<p>In Mr. Putnam's second statement he tries to score a point against Great Britain. As
in the former paragraph he understated his case, in this he would overstate it.</p>

<p>He complains that American authors have to make a <i>bona-fide</i> publication in Great
Britain within fourteen days of the publication in the United States. He italicises <i>bona
fide</i>. He must have overlooked the fact that <i>publication</i> is an essential part of copyright
in the States just as much as it is in Great Britain. This item then can be ruled out.</p>

<p>He contrasts, however, the meagre allowance of fourteen days under the British Act
against the liberal allowance of 180 (not 120) days under the American Act. It must be
pointed out with due emphasis that when the author is not hampered by typesetting
clauses, printed copyright notices, and filing difficulties, time in the matter of publication
is really of little account. The American publisher has merely to ship off a consignment
before he publishes the book in the States and to await instructions from the
London house that the consignment has arrived. There is no difficulty in this step. So
long as the technicalities of United States Act still stand we are sick of these counter-irritants,
which, now the war is over, "cut no ice."</p>

<p>We have heard that the Typesetters' Union&mdash;of which Mr. Putnam seems unduly
alarmed&mdash;could be made to understand from statistics supplied that they are standing
in their own light. But, perhaps, if they are still obdurate on the practical side, they might
be influenced by the argument of the idealist "that it is a disgrace to a civilised nation
to stand outside the intellectual Union of other civilised Nations." The Americans have
had the opportunity of joining the revised Convention of Berne for many years, but
have neglected to do so.</p>

<p>It is not astonishing, therefore, that President Wilson cannot influence them to follow
him into the League of Nations under the Peace Treaty.</p>

<p>For the last paragraph of Mr. Putnam's letter&mdash;his ἀπολογία {apologia} for American authors
and publishers&mdash;all authors in Great Britain are grateful. If British authors have
not followed with appreciation the efforts of their brothers in the States, they should
have done so. We gladly now pay tribute to the work of those who so long and earnestly,
yet unsuccessfully, have struggled to bring the United States to join the ranks of other
civilised nations.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h3>FLAUBERT AND MR. STURGE MOORE</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. H. W. Crundell thinks that I should explain the absence of a note to my
poem <i>Micah</i>; the presence of the one he suggests would have appeared to me an impertinence.
Did Gray and Arnold call attention by notes when they adapted a few lines
from Pindar? Did Tennyson thus docket what he owed to Homer and Virgil? To
me the explanation seems rather due from Mr. Crundell: why he wrote his letter,
and from you, why you printed it. However, obviously you think differently, so this
occasion may as well serve me to allay an innocent curiosity that I neither intended
to provoke nor to baffle. Besides Mr. Crundell's find there is a longer passage from
<i>Salammbo</i> in my <i>Mariamne</i>. I put a line from Goldsmith's <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i> into
my <i>Rout of the Amazons</i>, a phrase from Myers' translation of Pindar into <i>At Bethel</i>,
and a phrase from Milton into <i>Love's First Communion</i>. Excepting the usual array from
the Bible, I believe these to be all my verbal and literal appropriations.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h3>"MANSOUL"</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Your review of Mr. Doughty's <i>Mansoul</i> reveals an attitude somewhat similar
to that of Jeffrey towards Wordsworth. May a humble reader hesitatingly retort the
phrase&mdash;This will never do? Your reviewer does not think Mr. Doughty should be
ignored, but he finds Chaucer easier and more modern, and considers this poetry at
best a thing of tough shreds and purple patches.</p>

<p>With this opinion I do not contend, for I do not clearly understand upon what principle
of criticism your reviewer is acting; but I should like to suggest that his opinion
springs from a misconception which ought not to be nourished by the <span class="smcap">London Mercury</span>.
He seems to think that Mr. Doughty's "guttural obscurity of speech," his style in
general, is a vital fault. I submit that he assumes rather than proves such a degree of
obscurity, and that he puts an excessive value upon the merely formal and conventional
graces of English blank verse. He does not recognise that Mr. Doughty is making not
only his own poem, but his own style, and that the poetry is to be judged not exclusively
by its conformity with traditional verse&mdash;the false standard of the eighteenth century&mdash;but
by the success with which its style empowers and lucidly presents the author's conception.
Casual wrynesses, unaccustomed inversions, idiosyncratic punctuation (forgive,
dear Cobbett, the long words) do not affect this central question. Your reviewer admits
the greatness of the poet's conception, admits that it has the substantial elements of
noble poetry&mdash;I mean such elements as we find in <i>Paradise Lost</i> and <i>The Dynasts</i>&mdash;but
is unwilling to admit that his form is his natural form, the form that expresses not only
his explicit intention but his implicit character, and, therefore, a good form. I submit
that Mr. Doughty's style in poetry is the inevitable expression of his mind at work upon
imaginative themes. I submit that a true poet does not and cannot choose his style,
and that the test of his style is not its degree of conformity with Chaucer's simplicity,
Milton's lofty sweetness, Tennyson's effusive delicacy, but the fullness with which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">723</a></span>
expresses his own imaginative vision. Mr. Doughty has written, not a few miscellaneous
lyrics, but a vast body of poetry in which a perfectly clear apprehension of past and
future is presented. His themes are unfolded with such fullness as enables us to judge
whether the expression of them, unusual as it may seem, ruins them or preserves them
unspoiled, sustains or dulls their brightness. With extreme diffidence I suggest that your
reviewer has not addressed himself to this proposition, and that this proposition remains
an elementary principle of criticism. And I would remark that Mr. Doughty's own
observations upon his style (note to <i>The Dawn in Britain</i>, Volume 6) might suitably
be referred to for a precise statement of his attitude towards the English language.</p>

<p>The principles of criticism do not change, but may be eclipsed or clouded. They are
familiar, yet need constant reassertion and illustration. Difficult as it may be to reduce
these abstractions to clear and useful formulæ, I think it would be a service to letters if
you, Sir, would state and clarify them afresh. Wanting definition and illustration, creation
and criticism may become discordant, with unhappy results for each. It is my suspicion
of a faint discord that must form the apology for the length of this letter.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h3>JOHN DONNE</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>To the Editor of</i> <span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;After reading the most interesting paper on <i>John Donne</i> in the last number of
<span class="smcap">The London Mercury</span>, I wonder whether Browning had not him in mind when he
wrote <i>The Grammarian's Funeral</i>. "An hydroptic immoderate desire of human learning
and languages" consumed the "soul by-droptic" grammarian no less than Donne;
like Donne even to the crumbs he'd "fain eat up the feast, Aye, nor feel quaesy." He
knew nothing, it is true, of "the quaesy pain Of being beloved and loving"; his was
a passion of mind only, though, like Donne, he knew the sickness of the body overwrought.
The analogy could be traced further.</p>

<p>For more reasons than the tracing of remembrance of Donne in one poem it would
be interesting to know how "longe" Browning "hadde ygo" to the earlier poet.&mdash;Yours,

<p>I presume that the underlined words, which have often puzzled me, are an allusion
to the manners of the time, with which I am insufficiently acquainted. As none of the

your readers would oblige me by throwing some light on the matter.&mdash;Yours, etc.,</p>

<h2>LEARNED SOCIETIES, ETC.</h2>

<h3 class="left">THE SOCIETY OF ANTIQUARIES</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">VANDALISM</span> in Egypt is deplored in London, but in the present
circumstances we cannot throw stones. Rubbish-heaps are often romantic,
and those of Fostât (Old Cairo) contain masses of mediæval pottery and
other treasures well worth preserving; but the local authorities propose to
create a new suburb by erecting workmen's dwellings all over them.
Systematic excavation cannot be hurried, and careful search might throw light on the
origin of maiolica.</p>

<p>For the first time perhaps in its long history, the Society has devoted an ordinary
meeting to the discussion of Ways and Means. The following are the principal alternatives:
(i) To raise the subscription and invite donations; (ii) to extend the franchise
and popularise the Society; and (iii) to economise further and lower the output. The
argument that thousands are waiting to join in the work of the Society is not convincing;
and as about ninety per cent. of the Fellows do not attend the meetings, the
publications are their only tangible reward. If the standard is to be maintained, few
would expect the same return for half the subscription they paid on joining, but to
double the annual levy would be a drastic reform; yet the Society is further committed
to field-work of considerable public interest. The rich we have always with us, but their
presence is not felt so much here as in America.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE SOCIETY FOR THE PROTECTION OF ANCIENT BUILDINGS</h3>

<p>During the last few weeks the restoration of the Lady Chapel of Worksop Priory
has been in progress. It was a roofless ruin, retaining much fine thirteenth-century work.
It is being re-roofed, the fallen portions rebuilt, and missing parts renewed in the style
of the original building, the new work being made to resemble as nearly as may be
what the old is believed to have been.</p>

<p>This on the face of it <i>sounds</i> reasonable enough, but experience has shown that in
practice the result of such treatment is the reverse of satisfactory. It is exactly what the
restorers of the last century did, and what people with any knowledge or love of old
buildings deplore to-day, whenever it comes to their notice. It is just such a case as this
which goes to the root of the matter in which the Society interests itself, and its customary
ruling thereon may be stated in the following way:</p>

<p>1. The ruin should be subjected only to repairs needed for its upkeep.</p>

<p>2. If the site is absolutely necessary to the community for the purposes of its daily
life, it has a right to use such ruins and even in extremity to demolish them.</p>

<p>3. Confronted by a similar necessity it may be justifiable to incorporate an old building
in a new one. The danger in this case lies, however, in the fact that the desire to restore
for the sake of restoration may outrun the actual need of a new building designed to
fulfil some special purpose.</p>

<p>Having made this concession to a genuine demand, the Society still stands out against
restoration. The new work should be good and in harmony with the old, but it should
also be living architecture and not a study in dead style.</p>

<p>As Professor Lethaby expressed it, "Architecture is a current speech, it is not an art
of classical quotation."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">725</a></span>
But the Lady Chapel of Worksop Priory is actually being restored. So, though much
more might be said, the case ends here, save for the thought that with better guidance
different conclusions would have been reached.</p>

<p>The promoters of the scheme, having so far determined to make use of the ruin, might
have asked the advice of a selected group representative of our best men&mdash;a group
which should include within it one real authority versed in the building methods of
the same period as that of the ruin, an acknowledged authority on modern architecture,
a representative both of the Society of Antiquaries and the Society for the Protection
of Ancient Buildings. To these one would add a local architect or builder conversant
with the local conditions and material.</p>

<p>To such an advisory board would be committed the task of choosing an architect,
whose plans would be submitted for approval before being recommended to the
promoters.</p>

<p>The scheme may seem to savour too much of the ideal which has no part in actual
life, yet it is worth consideration, for from it, one might say almost inevitably, good
work must result.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact the Committee does comprise within itself the qualities of such an
advisory board, but the above suggestion is made for those who may prefer, for one
reason or another, to ask advice elsewhere.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND</h3>

<p>The work of this Society has two main branches: the first is the excavation of Egypt's
buried treasures and the publication of careful records of the finds; the second is the
preservation and translation of the inscriptions, including papyri found in the course
of excavation. The Society has already published hundreds of papyri, the most important
being included in the <i>Oxyrhynchus Papyri</i> edited by Professors Grenfell and Hunt.</p>

<p>In a lecture given at the rooms of the Royal Society, Burlington House, on Friday,
February 20th, on "The Historical Value of Greek Papyri," Mr. H. Idris Bell, a member
of the staff of the British Museum, gave a scholarly review of the work already done in
the publication of papyri, both in this and in other countries, and laid stress on the
necessity for further work in this direction. He pointed out that, although this country
was holding its own in the matter of publication of fresh material, it was falling behind
other countries in the work of comparing and computing results and the tabulation of
the information thus obtained.</p>

<p>The lecturer said papyri help to correct the false perspective in which we see history.
We tend to see it as a succession of dramatic events and of great personalities, and
economic processes attain a precision and clearness which is not obvious to contemporaries.
But this is not our attitude towards our own time, and documents show us
that it was not that of our predecessors. Great events of history occur but seldom, and
when they do they are recorded from the purely personal point of view. The historian
cannot chronicle minor interests, but the papyri serve as the "acid test" of the objectivity
of his narrative, and for this reason it is well that the student should supplement
his reading of history by some study of documents, and for no department of ancient
history have we a body of documentary evidence comparable to the papyri.</p>

<p>Papyri make us acquainted with the ordinary man, his style of living, his domestic
relations, and his family life; it thus becomes possible to study the popular psychology
of Græco-Roman Egypt, and so, by analogy, to some extent, the Græco-Roman world.</p>

<p>With regard to administration papyri show us the actual working, not the theory,
of administration, and the two rarely exactly coincide. So too with law; the practice of
the law usually differs from the theory of law, and papyri reveal the practice and show
us the applied law.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">726</a></span>
Turning to religion, papyri mostly illustrate the popular attitude towards religion;
there is not much on mystery cults, but they show the attitude of the individual towards
the deity. It is also possible from them to trace the borrowings of Christianity from
Paganism and to contrast the Christian and the pagan attitude.</p>

<p>The lecturer gave many interesting illustrations from papyri, including letters from
parents to children and children to parents, letters of condolence, letters from men
engaged upon business or war to their wives and families, which give a vivid picture
of the life of the time.</p>

<p>Sir Frederic Kenyon, K.C.B., who was in the chair, in thanking the lecturer emphasised
the importance of the study of papyri and the scope this branch of research opened
for original work. Here is a vast field of labour, at present only superficially worked; the
harvest is plentiful, but the labourers are few; certainly they are indefatigable, but
more workers are needed if the full value is to be extracted from these papyri. Other
countries are alive to the importance of the work, but our own Universities are somewhat
apathetic and need arousing.</p>

<h3 class="left">THE ROYAL NUMISMATIC SOCIETY</h3>

<p>At the monthly meeting of the Royal Numismatic Society on February 19th, Mr.
Percy H. Webb exhibited a portion of a find of late Roman coins from Egypt. The find
covered the period <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 298-313, Domitius Domitianus&mdash;Maximinus Daza, and was,
said to have comprised nearly two bushels of coins. The coins which Mr. Webb had
been able to examine belonged to the last five years of the period, and were of three
rulers only, Galerius Maximian, Galeria Valeria, and Daza. The bulk of the coins were
of the Alexandria mint, although Antioch, Cyzicus, and Nicomedia were also represented.
The find presented a number of interesting features and afforded an interesting
opportunity of testing M. Jules Maurice's work, which it supported in every detail.</p>

<p>Mr. G. C. Brooke read a paper by Mr. R. C. Lockett on "The Coinage of Offa." The
most reasonable suggestion for the date of the beginning of the Mercian coinage was
after the battle of Otford in 774, but it might be as late as the Council of Chelsea, 786.
The mint was probably Canterbury, as seven of his moneyers struck coins for Coenwulf,
and three of these worked for Eadberht, Cuthred, and Baldred. Coins bearing the name
Eadberht were probably to be attributed to Eadberht, Bishop of London, 772-787.
Another penny with the name hitherto not read satisfactorily should probably be attributed
to Higberht, Bishop of Lichfield, who was made Archbishop in 787. Cynethrith's
coinage was evidently struck in Offa's lifetime, either as a complimentary issue, or in a
period of regency during Offa's absence. A classification of the pennies of Offa was
proposed, based on their affinity to the coinage of Jaenberht and Æthilheard.</p>

<h2>BOOKS OF THE MONTH</h2>

<h3>POETRY</h3>

<h4 class="left">FLOWERS IN THE GRASS. By <span class="smcap">Maurice Hewlett</span>. Constable. 5<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>In recent years Mr. Hewlett, who earned his first fame as a romancer, has been devoting
himself most seriously to verse. And he has done a very remarkable thing. Two or
three years ago, with perhaps twenty novels and several books of poems behind him,
he brought out a long poem&mdash;<i>The Song of the Plow</i>&mdash;which was a new thing in poetry,
and which was indisputably the finest thing he had done in either "harmony," an
epical poem, which was as easy to read as an excellent novel, and as good to read the third
time as the first. There were lovely detachable things in it, but it was most striking when
taken as a whole, racy, muscular, original. He followed it with <i>The Village Wife's Lament</i>,
a tragedy of the war, only less striking in so far as it was less long. We have here a collection
of his recent lyrics. They have not the outstanding merit of those works on the
larger canvas, but they are far superior to his early lyrics, and bear new witness after
their manner to his late poetic flowering.</p>

<p>The poems are all rural: mainly Wiltshire, the ancient downs, the valleys, the
villages, the spire of Salisbury. But, save for a few delicious fancies about flowers, they
all contain the human too. Landscape for Mr. Hewlett, however beautiful, however
forbidding, is always a background for human character and human history. On that
great hill the ledges were planted with corn by primitive men; on that other the Roman
sentries stood; in that field there is a ploughman whose eyes and hair and thews are
Saxon. Quotation from him is difficult, because of the very largeness of his imagination;
his details are so subordinate that, though he usually gets the phrase right in its context,
he seldom gets the phrase arresting out of its context. Now and then he is gentler,
his language more honeyed, his rhythms less rugged, and in poems like <i>Summer Night</i>
he falls into a beautiful and a very "contemporary" music.</p>

<p>That, and <i>Jacob's Ladder</i>, and <i>The Cedar</i>, and the uncanny and impressive <i>Chelsbury</i>
are among the best things in the book; the last two show his historic imagination at
its best, economical though the expression is. But the best of all, we think, is <i>In the Fire</i>.</p>

<span class="i0">And candles flicker<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As pipes allume ...<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">The whole village passes across the vision: the smithy, a pair in a farm, an amber
blind with girls' shadows on it, a candle and one reading in a loft: the lights go out one
by one till all is dark. It is a charming picture, and the stanza is beautifully suited to
it. It is a pity that Mr. Hewlett mars it in places with a stumbling-block word or
rhyme.</p>

<h4 class="left">COUNTRY SENTIMENT. By <span class="smcap">Robert Graves</span>. Martin Secker. 5<i>s.</i></h4>

<p>It must be confessed that the very title of Mr. Graves's new book awakes in us a feeling
of pleasure. Mr. Graves has a <i>flair</i> for titles. We remember his <i>Beside the Brazier</i> and
<i>Fairies and Fusiliers</i> with a sense that the author has always succeeded in getting a
suggestion of his individual quality into the names of his books. In the volume before
us Mr. Graves repeats some of his former successes. The poem <i>A Frosty Night</i> is a
good example of that dialogue form which Mr. Graves uses with great skill, and in which
we may see the influence of the old ballads:</p>

<div class="p1 poem-container"><div class="poem">
<div class="center b0"><span class="smcap">Mother.</span></div>

<div class="p0 stanza">
<span class="i0">Alice, dear, what ails you,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dazed and white and shaken?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has the chill night numbed you?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is it fright you have taken?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="center"><span class="smcap">Alice.</span></div>
<div class="p0 stanza">
<span class="i0">Mother, I am very well,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I felt never better.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mother, do not hold me so,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Let me write my letter.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">It is a quiet beginning, and it looks very easy to do, but that appearance is deceptive.
To write with economy and in an almost conversational tone without becoming flat and
banal is extremely difficult, but Mr. Graves's hand rarely loses its cunning in those
awkward passages of low emotional pitch which are unavoidable in any sort of narrative
verse. When the pitch rises he has a remarkably sure touch and can give us a vivid
picture without any of the elaborate, detailed word-painting which is the bane of so much
modern poetry. What could be finer, for example, than the stanzas that follow those
already quoted:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem">

<p>Mr. Graves resembles Mr. W. H. Davies in the quiet freshness of his best work. If he
has a fault it is that he is rather too apt to point a moral. He may have caught this&mdash;along
with much of his rhythmic subtlety&mdash;from his study of nursery rhymes, but there
is very little of it in the present book, which is full of the most charming fancy. Perhaps
Mr. Graves's most characteristic work is to be found in such a poem as <i>Vain and
Careless</i>, which begins:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Lady, lovely lady,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Careless and gay!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once when a beggar called<br /></span>
<span class="i2">She gave her child away,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">and which continues in a quaint fantasy of thought and expression that is entirely Mr.
Graves's own, and is an original contribution to modern poetry. One of the best poems in
the book is called <i>Thunder at Night</i>, and it describes two children into whose dreams
the real thunderstorm outside their house enters. The boy is dreaming of a bear, the girl
of monkeys and snakes. The hot, confused feeling of the night is vividly suggested and
then the poem suddenly ends with a stanza that is a complete change in temperature
and beautifully suggests the approaching dawn:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">They cannot guess, could not be told<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How soon comes careless day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With birds and dandelions gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Wet grass, cool scents of May.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The book is well named <i>Country Sentiment</i>, for it has much of the beauty and the
fragrance of the countryside.</p>

<p>Of the authors of these three books of verse Mr. Henry W. Nevinson is the only one
who has made a reputation as a prose-writer, and it is not surprising that his work should
show the widest range of thought and expression. His poems maintain a high level
of accomplishment; here, for example, is a sonnet:</p>

<p>But it is the accomplishment of a sensitive and highly-trained mind, accustomed to
literary expression rather than the work of an original poet; none the less it reveals
sympathies and perceptions which the author has not been able to put into his prose.</p>

<p>Mr. R. L. Gales is an old hand who has written a great deal of charming verse, which
has been widely enjoyed by those who can appreciate smoothness and sweetness better
than music, colour, and imaginative power. Mr. Gales has a genuine vein of feeling and

<p>In some ways Miss Ruth Manning-Sanders' work is more ambitious than Mr. Nevinson's
or Mr. Gales'; but if she essays more, she performs, if anything, less. There is
evident in her work an ardent searching of the spirit and a philosophical tendency that
are worthy of praise, but nowhere are her emotions and thoughts transmuted into
poetry's gold by any magical touch. We have, in other words, much of the raw material
of poetry spread out before us, but not poetry itself. Nevertheless, there is a distinctive
quality in her work which has affinities with some seventeenth-century poems; it is
present in the poem entitled <i>Emotions</i>, which begins thus:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Spirits to whom my lady's little world<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Above the heavy hills that close around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My strip of ground,<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">but does not keep at that level.</p>

<p>It may be that Miss Ruth Manning-Sanders will achieve considerably more than she
has so far succeeded in doing.</p>

by <span class="smcap">Helen Rootham</span>. Introduction by <span class="smcap">Maurice Baring</span>. Historical Preface by
<span class="smcap">Janko Lavrin</span>. Frontispiece by <span class="smcap">Toma Rosandić</span>. Blackwell. 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The frontispiece of this volume is as crowded with names as a modern theatre programme;
we looked at the top for "licensee" and "lessee." But, unlike the plays,
the book is good. Serbia, which has several great cycles of epic-ballads, is the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">731</a></span>
country where the creation of poetry on primitive lines still flourishes; a cycle seems
to be developing out of the retreat through Albania. The greatest group of all, however,
is the group which grew out of the defeat (in 1389) by the Turks on the "Field of Blackbirds."
The originals (and Miss Rootham's versions) are all in trochaic decasyllabics.
They deal with one group of figures: the Tsar Lazar, who was killed; his wife Militsa;
the hero Milosh Obilish, who stabbed the victorious Sultan in his tent; Jug Bogdan,
his ten sons, and the traitor Vuk Brankovitch. The warriors march off, they are defeated,
they die: ravens or other messengers carry the news to the stricken Tsaritsa in her tower:
teamsters years after find the Tsar's head, still preserved in a well, and it miraculously
joins the body. All a nation's sorrow is in these songs, all the great memories and
defiant resolve, that kept the race alive and proud, and led the recapturers of Kossovo,
in our own day, to fall to their knees on the sacred ground. The translation seems very
good; the fire remains in the whole, but the magic has inevitably escaped from the
parts. We can only quote a specimen at random:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To his feet leaps Milosh, that great warrior,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the black earth bows himself, and answers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tsar Lazar, for this thy toast I thank thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thank thee for the toast and for the goblet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for those thy words I do not thank thee.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For&mdash;else may the truth be my undoing&mdash;Never,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tsar Lazar, was I unfaithful,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never have I been, and never will be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to-morrow I go to Kossovo<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the Christian faith to fight and perish.<br /></span>

<h4 class="left">FLEURS-DE-LYS. A Book of French Poetry freely translated into English verse.
By <span class="smcap">Wilfrid Thorley</span>. Heinemann. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>We may heartily congratulate Mr. Thorley upon his ambition and his industry. He
conceived the prodigious idea of giving English versions of poems by all the representative
French poets from the earliest age until our own time. He has translated three
hundred, and he has increased his labours by doing the earlier ones into archaic English.
For example, his first specimen (twelfth century) is entitled <i>The Twa Systres</i>, and
begins:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mirk did fa' lang syne, lang syne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When twa fond systres wi' hands that twine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went down to bathe whaur the waters shine.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">And Villon's most famous ballade opens:</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O tell me where and in what lande<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Flora and the Roman lass?<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">He knows his ground, and his selection of originals is admirable. But his versions
usually take the bloom off. Baudelaire's</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O Mort, vieux capitaine, il est temps, levez l'ancre<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">becomes</p>

<div class="poem-container"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Haul up the anchor, captain old, O Death, for it is time:<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p class="in0">which is the same thing with a difference. Sometimes he even fails to get essential parts
of the sense. In recommending his book, therefore, to those many to whom such a
survey in English would be useful, we warn them that the translations at best are graceful
versifying. Mr. Thorley, happily, is usually on his own highest level, and the book can
be read with very little annoyance and a certain amount of edification.</p>

<p>The title of this anthology is presumably ironical. He who would have a comprehensive
selection of war poems reflecting the sentiments of the mass of our people,
and most of the British soldiers, must go to Miss Jacqueline Trotter's <i>Vision and
Valour</i> (Longmans'), which we shall review in our next issue. This collection is a
collection with an avowedly propagandist aim. It contains poems exposing the cruelty
and filth of War in general, which were inspired by the late War. It is not yet complete.
For instance, Major Brett-Young's <i>Bête Humaine</i> might suitably have been
included. But most of the poems included are genuine and well written. Amongst the
authors "covered" are "A. E.," Paul Bewsher, Geoffrey Dearmer, Walter de la

Dora Sigerson, and Alec Waugh.</p>

<p>In <i>An Imperfect Mother</i> Mr. J. D. Beresford has set himself the extraordinarily difficult
and delicate task of describing a mother's unorthodoxy as seen by her grown-up children.
Of Mr. Beresford it can generally be said that he is quite fearless of the troubles he
makes for himself. Yet in this particular instance some doubt might be left in the reader's
mind as to whether his designing of the book was hurried or certain obvious issues
deliberately shirked. Some compromise may be arrived at between the two alternatives
when we consider the overwhelming evidence of this author's sincerity and his inflexible
allegiance to his art. Here the reader cannot fail to ask himself&mdash;what would I do&mdash;what
could I say, if my mother had run off with someone?&mdash;well knowing that in an enormous
preponderance of cases such a question is comfortably absurd. It is even indecent to
put such a question to yourself, is it not? It is the defilement of a sacred place? Exactly.
So is the book condemned at the very outset because its theme is "disagreeable" or
"delicate" or "unusually unpleasant"? That is where one's first doubts of Mr.
Beresford's complete fearlessness are bred. In his treatment of that disagreeable idea
there is nothing disagreeable. You feel that there should be. Mr. Beresford has gilded
his pill with a sugar of a too vigorous refinement. He has been at pains too great to disguise
the fact of its nastiness.</p>

<p>What did these children think and do? The boy Stephen, just leaving school, is the
only one that counts for much, though his two sisters, sketchy as is their appearance
in the story, are excellently considered. Before the actual crash comes they whisper
together about their mother's goings on, try to make their father speak of what they
believe should be uppermost in his mind, and insist on a full discussion with Stephen.
One of them was a school teacher, the other subsequently married an elderly chemist.
In a way they enjoy the scandal; you feel that some excitement has come into their
dull lives, with the piquancy of self-righteousness added to outraged innocence. They
want to make the most of it. They are not genuinely ashamed.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Emily turned the embarrassment of her steady gaze immovably upon her father.</p>

<p>"I don't know what's come to mother lately," she said.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirkwood began to fidget with his sparse little beard. "She's a little out of sorts,
perhaps," he hazarded feebly.</p>

<p>"Well, oughtn't we to <i>do</i> something, father?" Emily continued, still pinning him with
her stare.</p>

<p>"Oh! What <i>can</i> you <i>do</i>?" put in Stephen irritably....</p>

<p>Emily turned herself about and focused her attention upon her brother. "If she's out of
sorts she ought to see a doctor," she said.</p>

<p>"<i>That</i> wouldn't be any good," Stephen returned without hesitation.</p>

<p>"Well, but why wouldn't it?" Emily inquired, with a meaning in her tone that could
not be mistaken.</p>

<p>"No good asking me," was Stephen's evasion.</p>

<p>"Well, I think it's time something was done," Emily said, sharpening the point of her
now obvious intention.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean, Emily," little Kirkwood put in nervously.</p>

<p>Emily knew, they all three knew, that their father's remark had been intended as a
reminder that any open discussion of a mother's failings was impossible between father and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">734</a></span>
children; but Emily had made up her mind that the time had come when they must, in
her own phrase, "face the facts."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's <i>right</i> for us to let things go on and not make any effort to stop them,"
she said in a low but determined voice. "I don't see the good of our going on pretending,
when we all know perfectly well what's happening. Do you, Hilda?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," Hilda emphatically agreed.</p></blockquote>

<p>But with Stephen it is different. He really cares very little about appearances, though
he dreads facing his schoolfellows. He is wounded because his mother prefers another
man to his father and himself. And there is an occasion when he might have changed
his mother's decision had he known. Does he really want her, does he need her? she
asks herself. And just on that very day Stephen had been smiled upon by the little
daughter of his headmaster. She is fourteen, he seventeen. Impossible dreams fill
his mind. He has said nothing to his mother, but she knows. As though she had seen
the whole of the little trifling play enacted&mdash;for it was no more than one bright smile
cast over a dainty shoulder; no word had been spoken&mdash;she knew that another interest
had come, since yesterday, into the boy's life. He doesn't need her any more. His
protestations would have been passionate had they been genuine. She goes.</p>

<p>The view of the children towards the problem must depend entirely upon their
upbringing and the degree of sensitiveness in their relation to their mother. In regard
to Cecilia Kirkwood's family, Mr. Beresford has expected a good deal of our faith in
him. They were born and bred in a small cathedral town, their father was a bookseller,
their degree was humble but respectable. Yet from beginning to end Stephen can only
find it in his heart to think of his mother's flight as a callous desertion. He appears to be
completely oblivious of the moral involved and of all that is implied by his mother's
running away with the handsome organist. A closer scrutiny would have been horrible!
Yes: but would not Stephen have made it, and, unpleasant or not, should there not be
in the story some indication that he did make it?</p>

<p>To speak of a "handsome organist" is, in passing, liable to misconstruction, for
Dr. Threlfall was not only good-looking but clever and accomplished in manner; not
only an organist, for when he left Medboro' he gave up playing the organ for the composition
of light opera, and became an emphatic success. Taking Cecilia for granted, we
can well imagine that she would run away with Threlfall, and would do all the other
things that Mr. Beresford makes her do, and talk as she does. But it is hard for the reader
to take her for granted, just as it was hard for her neighbours in Medboro'. Cecilia's
father was a philosophic tuner of pianos. He had been against her marriage in the first
instance, but he rather approves of her adultery ... but it is understood that the
nature of piano-tuners is warped.</p>

<p>Cecilia was an amazing wife for a country bookseller, and she tries, one sometimes
thinks, to be <i>grande dame</i> in conversation, setting the whole of the little provincial town
by the ears with her outlandish brilliance and daring, making it grovel at her feet because
of her beauty and amiability.</p>

<p>Can a lady kiss her toe?</p>

<p>Yes; she might&mdash;she might do so&mdash;sang another novelist, who indulged in rhyme.
So it is with Cecilia; she might, she might have done so, but Mr. Beresford has failed
to make it inevitable of her.</p>

<p>Old Kirkwood, the father, dies insane, and Stephen, adopted by a rich builder who
was sympathetic because his own wife was a little difficult, works hard and finally
superintends the erection of a big newspaper office in London. There he falls in with
his mother once more, and with the schoolmaster's daughter who had smiled upon him
long ago. The old tussle is re-enacted. The mother is jealous of the girl. She sees her
son blundering in his courtship, and she only has to hold her tongue to keep him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">735</a></span>
her side, a devoted slave. She is not happy. Her organist-composer is jovial, but unfaithful.
She longs for the fealty of Stephen. At this point Mr. Beresford introduces a little
Freudian interest in the explanation of what was, for all he says about it, a matter of
secondary importance to Stephen&mdash;his disgust at his mother's hysterical and untimely
laughter, and we feel that, whilst he was about it, he might have examined Cecilia's
psyche a little more thoroughly. There were one or two dark places in her character and
disposition upon which a more searching light might, with some profit to the story,
have been thrown. There is much enjoyable reading in <i>An Imperfect Mother</i>, but on the
whole, coming from Mr. Beresford, it is a little disappointing.</p>

<p>In <i>Eli of the Downs</i> Mr. C. M. A. Peake introduces himself to the public with a distinguished
piece of work. He has been content to make his own variation of the archetype
of great stories&mdash;the joys and sorrows at home, the adventures, and, finally, the
return of the wanderer. This is the story of Eli Buckle, as gleaned by the teller from Eli
himself, and from his old friend and neighbour Anne Brown, and it is the story of a
perfectly simple and sincere man, a shepherd, who is perfectly happy in the remote
solitudes which his calling entails upon him, with the wild flowers which arouse feelings
his creator does not try to make him express. He is proud and happy when as a boy of
twenty-one he has saved five pounds. These facts are simply stated, and yet there is not
the least hint of sentimentality or of bathos. He marries the girl of his heart, and
unexpectedly the knowledge comes to him of what he has been in need. "Oh, Mary, my
dear, my dear!" he whispered. "You won't never know how lonely I've a-been." A
little while goes by and he is lonely again, for while he is out in the night in the lambing
season Mary falls from a chair, and by the time Eli gets home she and the child that
should have been born to them are dead.</p>

<p>After that, in sheer desperation, Eli leaves his old home and goes away to sea. His is
the old quest of a wounded man for the purpose which lies behind all events. Once
before, when Mary had told him that he could be a preacher if he had the ambition, he
had for a moment found his voice.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"... I believe I could study fast enough, and I know I could preach. I could make them
listen to me; aye, have 'em all gaping after me like a nest of young thrushes, if I chose.
But I'd have to tell 'em what they wanted to hear, an' dress it up the way they likes, which
is what they mean by the Gospel and the Truth. But that I won't do, for I'm not sure that
their Gospel is my Gospel, or their Truth any Truth at all for the matter o' that. And about
God, my dear. Whether He is, or whether He isn't, what folks say, I can't testify till I
know, know of my own knowledge, and not because I read it in a book or someone told me."</p></blockquote>

<p>Occasionally the narrator of the story makes a little confidence to the reader which,
apart from its humorous candour, serves a definitely useful purpose.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Now the scenes of Eli's childhood were the scenes I lived among when I too was a child,
and the land where he spent the years of his middle age I knew and loved, as youth and
man, but though I have crossed many waters, I am no sailor, and I cannot see the ocean as
a mariner sees it.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the course of his life as a sailor Eli has many adventures, which are wonderfully told,
dramatic without one word of melodrama. Here the author who can lovingly describe
the wild flowers in the lost corners of the Downs excels again, for in a few words he can
truthfully describe how a particular species of liar describes himself, or how nervousness
passes into wild terror in the eyes of a San Francisco crimp who is discovered
trying to drug his victims. But well as Mr. Peake describes the rascalities of the adventurous
life, he is more at home with the kindlinesses of the countryside and the gentle
wisdom of Cathay. This is a novel, uneven in quality to be sure, but touching at certain
points real beauty.</p>

Mr. Hugh F. Spender in <i>The Banner</i> describes a revolution in England, organised
by the League of Youth, backed by the People's Army, and inspired by Helen Hart,
daughter of a millionaire, who has a bias against the landed gentry. Most elderly people
in the book come in for a good deal of facetiousness directed against their ponderously
old-fashioned views. One young lordling, deaf and dumb from shell shock, has his senses
restored by the mere sight of the new Joan of Arc, and falls in love with her. She refuses
him at first because she is vowed to The Cause.... "For a moment she resisted,
resisted almost fiercely, and then she lay passively like a child in his arms." Mr. Spender
has invented a young man who willingly throws up both title and title-deeds at the call
of the People and becomes plain Citizen; but it is a pity that the author in creating
another peer should have given him an existing name. Regarded either as fiction or as
propaganda this is a poor book.</p>

<p><i>Roast Beef, Medium</i> is the curious title that Miss Edna Ferber has given to the Business
Adventures of Emma McChesney. This American authoress, who writes vivaciously
in her own language, gives bright and cheerful expression to her belief that people
should be earnest and good and that Roast Beef (not too underdone is conveyed by
"medium") should as a staple diet take precedence of flaked crab meat with Russian
sauce. These business adventures are certainly not <i>caviare</i>. Emma McChesney is a
bagwoman, representing T. A. Buck's Featherloom Petticoats. Rivals make love to her
and try to get the better of her alternately, and she has a young cub of a son to support.
Very sick of hotel life, she longs for a house of her own&mdash;especially a kitchen. In the
last chapter she gets them. The book is full of homely advice. Emma was fresh and wholesome
in appearance, though not so young as the picture on the wrapper deceitfully
indicates. But she was a good sort and refused to Marry T. A. Buck himself because
she didn't love him. She was, in fact, a "worth-while" woman.</p>

<h3>BELLES-LETTRES AND CRITICISM</h3>

<h4 class="left">AN INTERPRETATION OF KEATS'S "ENDYMION." By <span class="smcap">H. Clement
Notcutt</span>. Printed for the Author by the S.A. Printing Co., Capetown.</h4>

<p>Mr. Notcutt, who is professor of English in the University of Stellenbosch, believes
that <i>Endymion</i> enshrines an allegory, or at least that it contains, in a clear unbroken
stream beneath the surface, a meaning that corresponds with the ideas that filled the
poet's mind. The alternative can hardly be impugned; it is as true of Keats as of most
poets, and in the interpretation of Professor Notcutt it appears to mean little more
than that there is a general reflection of the ardour of the poet's mind and his desire of
beauty and beauty's immortality. If it is a question of allegorising to a greater extent
than that vague generality, then Keats is surely the last poet who can be taxed with it.
Professor Notcutt recognises some of the objections and says that the reason why Keats
did not explain his allegory was that he was dissatisfied with the poem and discouraged
by its reception; but that does not explain why, in the intimacy of his letters (many
of which allude to <i>Endymion</i>) he did not give a hint to anybody that there was an allegory
to explain. The letters, indeed, with which Professor Notcutt shows an excellent familiarity,
speak freely of imagination and invention, in reference to <i>Endymion</i>, but of
recondite suggestions and esoteric gospelling there is nothing. Nor can we regret this.
A heavenly meaning attached to the earthly story would not have made <i>Endymion</i> a
better but a worse poem. It is one of the most beautiful, if one of the most faulty, poems
in the language. It was Keats's privilege to see and create beauty and present it as a
finer reality in the midst of the crude and half-unreal realities of common life. Had he
lived he might have enlarged even this office in fulfilling it, but it is sufficient that
<i>Endymion</i> shows that he could fulfil it.</p>

<h4 class="left">CERVANTES. BY <span class="smcap">Rudolph Schevill</span>. Murray. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<h4 class="p0 left">TOLSTOY. By <span class="smcap">G. Rapall Noyes</span>. Murray. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>For most of us Cervantes is Don Quixote: even if we are familiar with <i>The Exemplary
Novels</i> and the <i>Journey to Parnassus</i>, we do not get from them any idea of personality
which infringes on the overwhelming effect produced by the Knight of La Mancha. Even
Mr. Schevill, who is a Professor of Spanish Literature in the University of California,
in his effort to give us an idea of Cervantes only succeeds in producing an idealised
portrait of Don Quixote. How odd this is can be realised if we try to think of other
imaginative authors in the terms of their characters. If we are tempted to think of
Shakespeare as Hamlet, we immediately correct ourselves by recollections of Falstaff,
of Prospero, of Coriolanus, or Juliet. No one, however much he may be persuaded that
the <i>Papers of the Club</i> are the author's best book, begins to compare Dickens with
Pickwick; nor, to take an author nearer Cervantes in time, has one any inclination to
identify Rabelais with <i>Pantagruel</i>.</p>

<p>Two explanations of this odd fact about Cervantes are possible: one is that he had
exhausted his capacity for creative, imaginative work in the writing of <i>Don Quixote</i>&mdash;but
this view cannot be upheld by anyone who loves the <i>Exemplary Novels</i>. The other is
the simple one that Cervantes was Don Quixote. It is a commonplace of psychology,
especially of Catholic psychology, that men of fine temperament will always be
severer on faults which are their own. Cervantes found in himself the exaggerated
chivalry which he starts to mock, but still loves in Don Quixote. He had the Crusader's
heart, but he lived in a time when&mdash;<i>pace</i> Mr. Chesterton&mdash;the Crusading spirit was dead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">738</a></span>
or knew the uglier ends. So in his immortal story Cervantes presents the last knight
with tonic humour and loving laughter. Ultimately nothing can make anyone ridiculous
but success and prosperity; and from these Cervantes preserves his hero. Mr. Schevill's
book is not very lively reading. He gives us the facts of Cervantes' life, and his treatment
of Cervantes' art in comparison with other Spanish popular works of the period has
no like value for English readers. At one time Spanish literature was well known in
England, but to-day we have no doubt that Mr. Schevill's detailed accounts of <i>La
Lazarillo</i> and <i>La Celestino</i> are necessary.</p>

<p>Tolstoy himself might have been imagined by Cervantes. That is the thought that
occurs in reading Mr. Noyes's book directly after Mr. Schevill's. Apart from that, no
two great artists could be more dissimilar. Tolstoy is always uneasy. It is his uneasiness
which caused his quarrel with Turgenev. It is his uneasiness which makes it impossible
for him to remain steadfast to his own convictions. For years there was a false idea
of Tolstoy, which is only gradually yielding to the facts. He was neither saint nor
prophet; but an ordinary man with a capacity for self-analysis enormously magnified&mdash;so
magnified that he seems a giant. It is this huge quality which makes so many critics,
as Mr. Noyes, class him far beyond Turgenev and Dostoevsky, and put him in a position
which he is willing to occupy in the future. Of direct personal criticism Mr. Noyes
gives us little. He is overcome by the amount of his material, and is too fond of approaching
his subject through the books of other critics. For instance, he quotes Mereshkovsky's
comment on the end of <i>War and Peace</i>, as if it was a <i>locus classicus</i> on <i>Natasha's</i>
psychology, instead of a piece of ill-natured criticism on a great artist by a showman.
The end of <i>War and Peace</i>, which shows us Natasha absorbed in Cervantes' life, is
the same criticism on wars, grandeurs, and world-spooks as is made by Hardy's
poem on <i>The Breaking of Nations</i>; and neither has any cynicism in it. Mr. Noyes's
picture of Tolstoy the man adds nothing to Aylmer Maude's exhaustive volumes;
and he values too seriously and literally a great deal of Tolstoy's detailed religious
writing. His book is, however, worth having, even if only for the superb lines written
by Tolstoy to some abject person who objected to <i>Resurrection</i> as "smutty." We will
not give his name, but he was, alas! English. Tolstoy, writing in English, defends
himself and then says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I wrote the book I abhorred with all my heart the lust, and to express this abhorrence
was one of the chief aims of the book. If I have failed in it I am very sorry, and I am pleading
guilty if I was so inconsiderate in the scene of which you write that I could have produced
such a bad impression on your mind. I think that we will be judged by our consciences and
by God, not for the results of our ideas, which we cannot know, but for our intentions, and
I hope my intentions were not bad.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Did ever great artist humble himself so generously? His attacker, with his unpleasant
mind, will be numbered with the excellent Mr. Hyde, who inspired Stevenson to his
defence of Damien.</p>

<h4 class="left">BOOKS IN THE WAR. By <span class="smcap">Theodore Wesley Koch</span>. Boston: Houghton Mifflin
Company.</h4>

<h4 class="p0 left">VILLAGE LIBRARIES. By <span class="smcap">A. Sayle</span>. Richards. 5<i>s.</i></h4>

<p>Mr. Koch's amply illustrated book is, in the main, a record of the achievements in the
war of the American Library Association. As such it is exhaustive, if rather wanting
in variety. The soldiers' demand for books, after all, and gratitude for their bestowal,
were much the same in America as in France, in the trenches as in hospitals, so that
by the time he has finished this book the reader is somewhat wearied by the repetition
of feats of distribution, surveys of the vast literary field covered, instances of literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">739</a></span>
recalcitrance overcome by deft suggestion and so forth. Nevertheless, it is a book of
considerable interest and will bear permanent witness to the fact that, in all future
wars, libraries will have to be mobilised with the armies. Over and over again the fact,
which we have all learned, is insisted on that food for the mind is one of the most
important sustainers of moral. Not only is reading an anodyne, but it is a disinfectant
and a prophylactic, as necessary in war as chloroform, lysol, and anti-typhoid vaccine.
In all that vast organisation of intense welfare&mdash;work which, spasmodic and fragmentary
in peace, was by a supreme irony perfected in war&mdash;the supplying of books to soldiers
and sailors held a high place. Every taste had to be catered for, every degree of education
given its appropriate food. To some the Army was an elementary school, to others
it almost fulfilled the functions of a university, especially after the Armistice, when
ambitious educational schemes were set on foot to calm idle and chafing warriors, and
when our own War Office deluged France and Germany with piles of lofty literature,
very little of which, we believe, was read.</p>

<p>The belligerent nations learned at last that it was just as worth while to tempt a
soldier to read as to teach him to shoot. The question now remains what fruit this
discovery is going to bear in peace, where the problem, apparently simpler, is really
harder. Soldiers at war had not the opportunity of using their leisure as they wished;
they were circumscribed in place and opportunity. The free citizen is less fettered, and,
being more scattered, is less amenable to propaganda. Yet for citizens at peace, no less
than for soldiers at war, propaganda, tactful and patient, is necessary if they are to be
induced to apply the medicine of reading to their minds. From a quite different point
of view this truth is made clear by Miss Sayle's little book, which is a development
of an attractive article in the <i>New Statesman</i> describing the beginning and development
of a library in a small Hampshire village. It is a book which all who have similar ambitions
for their villages should read, for it will save them many natural and fatal errors, besides
telling them all they need know about organisation, finance, book-buying and book-housing,
in plain words with plenty of humour.</p>

<p>Miss Sayle very strongly insists on it that a village library must be simply and solely
a circulating library, stocking the books which its members want to read <i>and no others</i>.
More ambitious efforts may be made wherever the Public Libraries Act is applied, but
a village library will almost always be supported by voluntary subscriptions, and can
only afford books which pay their way. She shows how much propaganda is needed to
start even such a library and to keep it going&mdash;a library from which practically every
book that was not agreeable fiction had to be ruthlessly weeded. In twelve years the one
visible sign of progress has been the tendency of Mrs. Alfred Sidgwick to replace Mrs.
Henry Wood as the favourite. Yet she holds that it has been worth while, and we agree.
A small agricultural community has been induced to own, manage, and take a pride in
a library, and even the fact that "father went less often to the 'Anchor' as the result" is
a solid testimony to its value. If life of villages in the future regains its old vigour without
becoming entirely urban in character, enterprises of this kind will be a duty incumbent
on their more enlightened members. And they will only be successful if Miss Sayle's
maxims are followed. Her "dont's" are admirable, and the biggest one of all is "don't
get slack." She might have added the lesson of Mr. Koch's book and of the whole war:
"don't forget that any reading is better than a vacant mind."</p>

<h4 class="left">FROM FRIEND TO FRIEND. By <span class="smcap">Lady Ritchie</span>. Murray. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Perhaps the most distinguishing of the pleasant Victorian characteristics was the combination
of dignity with charm, and few of the artists of the period had that combination
to a greater degree than Thackeray's daughter. This last volume of hers is entirely
civilised and urbane in its appeal, and yet has, with its urbanity, a warmth of affection
and a genuine love for and interest in others which are often lacking in the better,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">740</a></span>
more highly-coloured works of contemporary art. It is a book of memories, and what
Lady Ritchie remembers is not mere gossip, not what can be had by observation, but
the deeper things of friendly intercourse, and the light thrown on character by circumstance
and intimacy. The title-essay is mainly concerned with that remarkable woman,
Julia Margaret Cameron, who was the friend of all the great men of her day, and the
first woman to attempt artistic portraiture in photography. In telling of her Lady Ritchie
cannot avoid a certain kindly humour; but the Victorians' laughter was not cruel, and
though Mrs. Cameron must have been at times rather a burden, one can feel sure no
one of her friends let her guess it. Certainly worse fates might overcome one than to be
nursed by her. Mr. Cameron was ill and his wife gave him "home care and comforts."
During the crisis he had "strong beef-tea thickened with arrowroot six times a day,"
and when he was convalescent,</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The patient has poached eggs at night, gets up at eleven, has his dinner (gravy soup and
curry) at one, mulligatawny soup and meat at five, a free allowance of port wine, averaging
a bottle a day. Ten drops of Jereme's opiate every morning, a dose of creosote zinc and
gum arabic before his meals, and a dose of quinine after each meal.</p></blockquote>

<p>There are essays on Mrs. Sartoris and Mrs. Kemble, a brief note on a Roman Christmas,
when she saw Lockhart driving with Frederic Leighton, a few slighter pieces,
and then, last of all, a tale&mdash;<i>Binnie</i>&mdash;belonging to the Mrs. Williamson series. Not
many people, one supposes, now read <i>Old Kensington</i> or "Miss Thackeray's" other
novels, but there should be something of a demand for them by those who first meet
her lucid, gentle narrative talent in the story of <i>Binnie</i>.</p>

<span class="smcap">L. H. Brewitt</span>. Methuen. 6<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The snare of descriptive writing in novels is as the snare of decorative passages in an
imaginative painting; the descriptions may fail to combine, remain detached from
the meaning and purpose of the novel, and finally the novelist may be tempted by his
skill in such writing to indulge in it at the expense of his proper task. French novels,
the worst of which have as a rule a composition too often absent from ours, rarely abound
in purple passages&mdash;certainly with no French novelist of equal standing could an
admirer do what Mr. Brewitt has done with Mr. Phillpotts. Here are a hundred of
Mr. Phillpotts's best decorations, full of observation, sensitive at times to another beauty
than the merely observed, but rarely fused by that imaginative ardour which makes
some of Mr. Hardy's and Mr. Conrad's descriptive passages an essential part of the
novel. Sometimes, especially in his description of violence, Mr. Phillpotts's meaning
is obscure: for instance, in the account of the Flood from one book you have a
simile which is of no assistance to the picture&mdash;"Yelling, like some incarnate and insane
manifestation of the elements massed in one, the hurricane launched itself upon the
valley." He is more successful as a rule when he catches nature in softer moods, quick
with spring or flushed with summer: there is a genuine charm of fancy, if no imaginative
depth, in this pastel of a sleeping forest:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The trees indeed sleep, but they also dream. In the heart of every leafless oak a dryad
whispers that the days are fleeting; that the icy-footed winter hours are drawing into the
snow-wreaths away in their chill processions; that the fountain of the sap will soon rise
again to spring's unsealing; that swiftly will the bud-sheath swell and pale and shimmer
silkily down, like a cast-off veil at the feet of the vernal beeches.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Phillpotts rarely drops into that snare of the writer of picturesque prose, the
rhythm of blank verse; but his style is not always equal to the demands he makes upon
it. It never has the sombre, heavy-hearted gravity of Hardy's, nor the gloomy colour
and triumphant ecstasy of Ruskin's. This is indeed a photograph album rather than a
book of pictures.</p>

<h3>HISTORY AND BIOGRAPHY</h3>

<h4 class="left">THE STORY OF PURTON. A Collection of Notes and Hearsay gathered by
<span class="smcap">Ethel M. Richardson</span>. Bristol: Arrowsmith. 1919. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Mrs. Richardson, something of a new-comer to Purton, as it would appear, makes no
pretensions to original research, and has contented herself so far with giving rather a
guide to Purton than a history of the village, a pleasant, ample, and leisurely place in
North Wilts, with a fine church and an unusually fine stone-built manor house to its
name. Her explanatory sub-title, "Notes and Hearsay," prevents the expectation of
anything exhaustive. The notes, though excellent as far as they go, might have been
considerably extended with advantage to the book; and as to the hearsay, it must be
owned that, so far, she has not heard of much&mdash;nothing, we will engage, to what she
will hear if she lives in Purton long enough to be accepted by the natives. There is
abundant material in every old village in England for a good and useful contribution
to history, and, if Mrs. Richardson looks forward (as it is to be hoped she may) to a
new edition of her little book, we would recommend to her notice <i>Kingham Old and New</i>,
by W. Warde Fowler, which was published by Mr. Blackwell, of Oxford, in 1913,
and is a model for any such work. Another which might help her is <i>How to Write the
History of a Parish</i>, by the Reverend John Charles Cox, of which a fifth edition was
published in 1909. Her first care should be to get hold of the Enclosure Award and
Tithe Commutation Map, which ought to be in the vestry. One will give her the names
of the Common Fields; the other, compared with the large-scale Ordnance map and
helped by local knowledge, should enable her to find them all. Then, with the Parish
Registers and, with luck, some Court Rolls, she should be able to get well back in the
centuries, and might then make arrangements for a prolonged stay in London and
daily attendance at the Public Record Office. What she might find there, or fail to find,
there's no telling. If she were fortunate she would light upon some great old Chancery
or Exchequer suit&mdash;better than the one in the Star-chamber, good as that is, which
concerns the adventures of the image of Saint George, and is one of her happiest discoveries&mdash;in
which the pleadings would be written in pure Shakesperean prose, and
the depositions of witnesses record very often the <i>ipsissima verba</i> of the peasantry of
its time. Behind all that&mdash;since Purton belonged to Malmesbury Abbey&mdash;she would
find very much more than she has found so far concerning the economy, temporal and
spiritual, of her parish and manor. She should undoubtedly find Subsidy Rolls which
would record the names and status of the villagers back to the day of the Poll Tax.
Some of the early Court Rolls may be there, and possibly also a Survey or Extent,
which would give her the services and "boon-works" due from the bondsmen to their
lords. There is no limit to be set to what diligence, and help from Mrs. Story-Maskelyne
(whose chapter on Braden Forest and the parish boundaries is the best in the book),
may recover from the Mausoleum in Fetter Lane. To that adventure we heartily commend
Mrs. Richardson, that of a good book she may make a better.</p>

<h4 class="left">THE MANNERS OF MY TIME. By <span class="smcap">C. L. Hawkins Dempster</span>. Richards.
1920. 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></h4>

<p>Miss Dempster, who died in 1913, was authoress in her day of certain novels, of which
one, called <i>Vera</i>, was translated into Russian, and another, <i>Blue Roses</i>, was to be found
on every bookstall in America. It met, she tells us here, with the favour of the late
Duke of Albany. "Ah," said his Royal Highness, "<i>that</i> is a wonderful book! But why
<i>did</i> you make it so sad? Please to make your next one end well." "The next one will
be all right, sir. It is a Scotch story, and it does end well." That was at Cannes, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_742" id="Page_742">742</a></span>
Miss Dempster lived and moved in a society of exiled kings, Russian grand dukes,
princes, statesmen, high ladies and clergymen. The manners of such folk are without
doubt as worthy of record as those of any other people whomsoever; but Miss Dempster,
in the letters to an unnamed uncle, of which her book chiefly consists, contents herself
for the most part with recording their names, entrances and exits upon the scene of the
Riviera. We are irresistibly reminded of Captain Sumph in <i>Pendennis</i>.</p>

<p>"I remember poor Byron, Hobhouse, Trelawny, and myself dining with Cardinal
Mezzocado at Rome," Captain Sumph began, "and we had some Orvieto wine for
dinner, which Byron liked very much. And I remember how the Cardinal regretted
that he was a single man. We went to Aix-la-Vecchia two days afterwards, where Byron's
yacht was&mdash;and, by Jove, the Cardinal died within three weeks; and Byron was very
sorry, for he rather liked him."</p>

<p>Incidentally, one may call attention to the letterpress. On page 148 a lady is referred
to in a note as "a grandchild of Mr. Nassau, senior, now married to Mr. St. Loe
Strachey." It is not, we believe, even true of that particular grandchild of Nassau
senior's. We read of "the great <i>coups de logis</i>" of a castle in Normandy, of "the
<i>causus belli</i> of the Franco-Prussian War." On page 213 we have an epitaph which is
worth preservation:</p>

<h4 class="left">THE BRITISH ACADEMY: SEALS AND DOCUMENTS. By <span class="smcap">Reginald L.
Poole.</span> Oxford University Press, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Recently an important transaction was nearly stopped because one of the parties saw
on an official document what he took to be the initials of a particular person. The letters
were, however, only an indication where the seal should be affixed. Dr. Poole's <i>Seals and
Documents</i>, an offprint from the <i>Transactions of the British Academy</i>, deals with earlier
days, and may induce similar ignorance. It is but twenty odd pages long, but full of
matter which the judicious reader will value as from a master of diplomatic. It summarises
much learning, and suggests, by the way, several inquiries, <i>e.g.</i>, as to the displacement
of papyrus by parchment; the period at which a seal to close a secret letter&mdash;like
our modern sealing-wax&mdash;went out of fashion; and the use of the diminutive
<i>sigillum</i> instead of the classical <i>signum</i> for seal. Dr. Poole shows how easy it was for a
seal to be lost, and mentions that a unique document in the Bodleian has been "irreparably
mutilated" under the direction of the late Librarian. When parchment was
used, thin pieces of the actual material could be stripped from it to tie it up with a seal
affixed. It is odd that this simple practice has not been carried further back. Much of
interest is given concerning the Papal bull, a <i>bulla</i> of lead used in warm countries where
wax would not retain its distinctness. Bulls employed by the universal "Papa" remind
us of the classical "bulla" worn by boys. The most ancient in existence is that of Pope
Deusdedit (615-8). In England the bull is earlier than the wax seal, but the double-pendent
seal which led to the Great Seal is an English invention. The whole subject is

<h4 class="left">THE STONES AND STORY OF JESUS CHAPEL, CAMBRIDGE. Traced
and told by <span class="smcap">Iris</span> and <span class="smcap">Gerda Morgan</span>. Cambridge: Bowes &amp; Bowes, 21<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>Jesus College, Cambridge, has a unique beginning, as it grew out of a Benedictine
Nunnery, and Bishop Alcock, of Ely, its founder, when he did away with the discredited
sisterhood, adapted their ruined buildings instead of destroying them. The college was
erected to the honour of the Blessed Virgin, St. John, and St. Radegund, but Alcock
added the new title which it still bears. The names of Prioresses are preserved from
Letitia, <i>circa</i> 1213, to Joan Fulbourne, 1493. Though we do not know precisely when
the nuns began, there is an unusual amount of records left concerning them which tend
to show that they were distinguished in family rather than learning, and given to hospitality
as well as good works. They owed their butcher £21 at a time when a sheep
cost a shilling. Let us hope that the good man's daughters learnt something as boarders
in the St. Radegund Guest House. What can be gathered concerning early days is told
pleasantly. It may seem odd that a nunnery should exist in Cambridge, quite near the
site of the famous Sturbridge Fair; but the ladies started before the colleges began, and
they were some way off the nucleus of academic buildings. The excellent sketches are
a great addition to the book. The beautiful piscina figured on page 286 has long been
familiar to lovers of Cambridge architecture, but new discoveries have been made
since Le Keux published his <i>Memorials</i> in 1845. Jesus has been lucky in its antiquaries
and historians, also in escaping the full fervour of that debased Gothic which flourished
in the nineteenth century. The discovery of the Chapter Arches by the Rev. Osmond
Fisher in 1893 is quite a romance. He was able to supplement many years earlier the
indolence of a Master and save the Tower from falling.</p>

<p>The notes, other than architectural, chronicle the varying fortunes of the foundation,
with details of the plague, plays in English and Latin, militant and destructive commissioners,
and worthies like Tobias Rustat, Yeoman of the Robes to Charles II.
Cranmer's is the first name in the college lists, and it has always been distinguished
in theology, though for most people its main modern reputation is for athletics. This
side of the college is, however, not touched by the authors, who deal with reverend
signiors and men famous in literature.</p>

<p>The college can boast of Sterne, whose grandfather was one of its masters; but
nothing is known of his academic behaviour. This is just as well, since his associate
Hall-Stevenson can hardly have been a model young man. Coleridge, the only poet,
we think, who ever won an academic prize for a Greek Ode, was decidedly eccentric,
and had a reputation for saying good things, as we learn from the lively pages of Gunning.
He was treated with great leniency by the dons of Jesus, and left through his own perversity.
His poetry at this time is negligible, and his lines "to a young Jackass on Jesus
Piece," whom he wished to take with him,</p>

<p class="in0">reveal the coming exponent of Pantisocracy. We do not think that his rowdiness at
the trial of Frend in the Senate House is to his credit, in spite of his explanations.</p>

<p>The work of both writer and artist shows a genuine enthusiasm for the college and
its memories. Both illustrations and print gain by the ample page; but a book
weighing well over two-and-a-half pounds will hardly do as a "handbook."</p>

net.</h4>

<p>Mr. Harvey's book strikes one immediately as amazingly truthful. He not only gives
one facts about his prison life in Germany, he avoids giving too many facts. Deliberately
he refuses to be preoccupied with the mere horrors, or the beastliness of some of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">744</a></span>
captors, or the nervous strain on the prisoners. And this surely is artistically right, if
one is to get a picture of what prison life meant to the average normal prisoner. The
men who wished to retain sanity had to keep out of their minds, so far as they could,
the things which Mr. Harvey leaves out of his book. They endeavoured by work, by
lectures, by concerts, by games, by theatrical performances to recall continuously to
themselves that normal life still prescribed in spite of their untoward fate. And nobly
most of them succeeded. Perhaps some of their efforts were a little uncalled-for. For
instance, Mr. Harvey tells us that on their first arrival at Guterslob new prisoners were
treated quite formally by their fellow-countrymen:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>New arrivals were not ignored by the British. There was a system whereby they
even fed (German food being totally inadequate) until their own parcels began to arrive.
Clothes, too, were served out to those who seemed in need. And there were invitations
to tea with senior officers and officials. Such preliminaries accomplished, however, one
was dropped like a hot coal&mdash;for a time, that is, until one had proved oneself.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">And he also states that when at Crefeld all prisoners other than British were turned
out. "We thought it damnable." The truth is our Allies had been, far more than we
realised, an interest and diversion in captivity. Certainly it must have seemed odd to
be made welcome by Russians and French rather than by one's fellow-countrymen,
and we think it is due not, as Mr. Harvey, "to the national tradition," but to the public
school and university tradition of the new boy and the freshman. Mr. Harvey enlivens
his book with specimen lectures&mdash;including an excellent one of his own on Shaw&mdash;poems
and anecdotes; and there are amusingly rough sketches by Mr. C. G. B. Bernard.</p>

<p>Mr. Bourne has written a beautiful and sensitive little book about his grandfather, and
his own memories of his grandfather's village. It has in it that deep and still appreciation
of English country and of the ways of English peasants, which is so common to
all who know and love them, and so very rarely expressed. It has the quality of Jefferies
at his best, and of Mr. Hudson too. The scenes which he evokes&mdash;the broad green
spaces, the silence, the interminable round of tasks, the handling of the earth and its
store&mdash;will never come again in the places of which he tells us. Farnborough, Frimley,
Camberley, Yateley are suburbs of London, over-run by the spawn of Aldershot and
the railway. Nowadays one must go further afield to realise the presence of Saint Use;
and a term seems to be set even there. It is not that, in the Roman poet's phrase,
<i>Nos patriæ fines et dulcia linquimus arva</i>: rather that those fair fields are flying
further from us&mdash;as well they may, seeing what we make of them. Such a book as Mr.

which it records, but very much also for the tenderness and fidelity with which it does

<h3>POLITICS AND ECONOMICS</h3>

<h4 class="left">COAL MINING AND THE COAL MINER. By <span class="smcap">H. F. Bulman</span>, M.I.Min.E.,
Assoc. M. Inst. C.E., F.G.S. Methuen. 15<i>s.</i></h4>

<h4 class="p0 left">NATIONALISATION OF THE MINES. By <span class="smcap">Frank Hodges</span>, Secretary of the
Miners' Federation of Great Britain. With Foreword by the Right Hon. <span class="smcap">J. R.
Clynes</span>, M.P. Leonard Parsons. 4<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></h4>

<p>Mr. Bulman is a mining engineer who has been a colliery manager and a director of
colliery companies, and he has a wide knowledge of the subject. He has much of interest
and value to say about the getting of coal, the technical processes and the machinery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">745</a></span>
the work of the miners and their dangers. But he does not confine himself to these matters;
he deals with many of the controversial questions that are exercising the public mind at
the moment. His book was written unfortunately&mdash;or fortunately&mdash;before the Coal
Commission, as he puts it, "commenced its novel proceedings," and his allusions to
the evidence it took and the reports it issued are confined to a note or two here and there.
There is no doubt, however, which side he is on. Though sympathetic enough to the
miners, he has plenty of hard words to say of their Trade Unions. He deplores the prevalence
of ca'canny, of absenteeism, of the aggressive spirit shown towards the employers.
Over Government interference he waxes very bitter; many of the rules and regulations
imposed on the management for the safety of the miners rouse his ire, whilst the Minimum
Wage Act he regards as utterly mischievous, since it "encourages the indolence
which is so prominent a characteristic of human nature." The longest chapter in the
book discusses in considerable detail&mdash;and with many attractive plans and pictures&mdash;the
housing of the miners. Mr. Bulman thinks that it is very unfair to throw the blame
for bad housing conditions on the colliery owners, who, he says, have done more than
most employers to provide houses for those they employ. But many, we think, who
have read the evidence given to the Royal Commission, whatever may be their views
on the proper method of running the coal industry, will find themselves at issue with
Mr. Bulman on that point.</p>

<p>Mr. Hodges makes a direct and ably-reasoned appeal for the nationalisation of the
mines. He is, we think, at rather needless pains to disclaim "politics" in his book.
His main emphasis is certainly on the economic aspect of the problem; but he cannot
avoid being "political" in the largest sense. He exposes, with a good deal more stress
than Mr. Bulman, the wasteful methods of coal production by the 3300 British collieries
operated by 1452 companies, and subject to the "dead-hand" of 4000 royalty owners,
as well as its wasteful methods of consumption at the collieries and further afield. He
discusses the decrease of output, the main reason for which he will by no means admit
to be the naughtiness of the miners. And he directs the notice of the unhappy general
public to the fact that we are faced at the same time with a decline in production and
a large increase in profits. What, then, does Mr. Hodges want? He sees "no other remedy
except that of National ownership of the entire industry, with joint control by the full
personnel of the industry and representatives of the whole community." The miners,
he avers, are as much opposed to bureaucracy as the most extreme of "anti-nationalisers."
Both the Sankey scheme and the original scheme of the miners ("The Nationalisation
of Mines and Minerals Bill," which is printed as an Appendix to the book) guard against
this. The State is to own the industry, but the machinery of Pit and District Committees
and a National Mining Council would mean management by those engaged in the
industry, together with representatives of the consumers. This last part is important,
for the Syndicalist idea of the "Mines for the Miners" is, in Mr. Hodges' view, antisocial
and "repugnant to our communal instincts." Nor will he allow that there is any
substance in the fear that the initiative secured by private ownership will be lost. If this
initiative really exists to-day, it will be increased a hundredfold, he argues, when scope
is given to the brain-workers who are responsible for the running of the industry.
Altogether the book is one which is worthy of the most careful study by nationalisers
and anti-nationalisers alike.</p>

<h4 class="left">SOCIAL THEORY. By <span class="smcap">G. D. H. Cole</span>. Methuen. 5<i>s.</i></h4>

<p>It is a commonplace of our sceptical and disillusioned age that all our cherished institutions
are in the melting-pot. The old economic order is tottering; the finger of scorn is
pointed at the hollowed principle of Parliamentary Government. Eager reformers preach
Democracy and yet more Democracy. But the discontented citizen finds himself getting
ever a larger portion of the shadow of Democracy and ever less of the substance. To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">746</a></span>
him in his perplexity comes Mr. Cole, offering a new social theory, to explain the causes
of the evil and its true remedy. What is wrong, he asserts, is the false doctrine that
endows the State with sovereign attributes and makes it supreme in every sphere. His
treatment of Leviathan is drastic. He is not merely for curbing it, nor, on the other hand,
for its complete destruction. What he wants is to deflate the monster, so to speak, and
reduce it to the status of a decent domestic animal with a carefully limited sphere of
usefulness.</p>

<p>The democratic society which Mr. Cole foresees will be a co-ordinated system of
functional associations, guilds of producers, co-operative societies of consumers, and
many others. The State will no longer be sovereign, it will merely be one of those associations,
confined to its own specific functions. For each function in society there must be
found an association and method of representation, and for each association and body
of representatives a function. "Representative democracy," as we see it to-day in a
"single omnicompetent Parliament," is a mockery; for "no man can represent another
man, and no man's will can be treated as a substitute for, or representative of, the wills
of others." This does not mean that Mr. Cole denies the validity of all representative
government, only that he wants it put in a truer form. And that form is functional representation.
The elected representatives of the future, of whom clearly there will be many&mdash;and
"Why not?" says Mr. Cole&mdash;are not to be mere delegates, but each will have a
more limited rôle, subject to more constant and closer criticism and advice from their
constituents and, in the last resort, to "recall" by them. It is in this functional organisation
that Mr. Cole centres his hopes of social and economic peace and progress, of
political justice, of liberty and happiness for the individual. It is a theory that is open to
criticism at several points, and no final judgment of it can, of course, be passed on the
basis of this book. But Mr. Cole at least argues his case very clearly and trenchantly,
and he has made a notable contribution to political science.</p>

<h3>THEOLOGY</h3>

<h4 class="left">FIRST CHRISTIAN IDEAS. By <span class="smcap">E. C. Selwyn</span>. Murray, 9<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>The late Dr. Murray was of that type of scholar which England produces to perfection,
and of whom Dr. Abbott is our most notable and distinguished example. An untiring
patience, a close attention to detail, a rather over-dogmatic manner, and at times a
simple felicity are the chief marks of the school. In this posthumous volume Dr.
Selwyn continues his argument, advocated in previous books, that the writers of the
New Testament were familiar with the Septuagint rather than the Hebrew, and that
a great deal of the New Testament is <i>Midrash</i>&mdash;that is, hortatory comment&mdash;on Old
Testament stories. That he proves this thesis it would be too much to affirm; but he
certainly strengthens his case by the careful handling he gives here to selected passages,
especially the narratives of the Infancy and the Temptation. At times one meets sentences
in which one recognises the old headmaster rather than the student. For instance,
"The origin of the term Mass is Mazzoth, the cakes of unleavened bread, and no
other etymology is worth a moment's consideration"; but generally Dr. Selwyn's
points are made carefully, modestly, and carry conviction. This is especially true of a
really startling piece of exegetical translation in Chapter III. The upholders of the
Helvidian view that the brethren of Jesus were the children of Mary are fond of quoting
the phrase of St. Luke, "She brought forth her first-born son." Dr. Selwyn, with a
simplicity that seems unaware of its force, removes this argument in the following
passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Here we may notice two points which show his [Luke's] close observance of Scripture.
The first is one that opens a just complaint against R.V., which renders "She brought forth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">747</a></span>
her first-born son" (τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν Πρωτότοκον {ton huion autês ton Prôtotokon}). Luke is not speaking of uterine
children of Mary, but he is declaring a solemn title, on which St. Paul had already dwelt.
The title is based upon Ps. 89&mdash;"I will make him my First-born, higher than the sons of
the earth." Which renders the Greek best, the R.V. or "She brought forth her son, the
First-born"? There can be no question.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">It is unfortunate that Dr. Selwyn wrote an extremely unattractive style, and is singularly
unmethodical in the arrangement of his material. We have little doubt that this and
his other books will be pillaged by popular preachers and theologians who have none of
his scholarship. After all, such a fact is not an unworthy conclusion to the life of a great
schoolmaster, who belongs to a profession which is fated to give ideas to those who will
but rarely admit or even remember their source.</p>

<h4 class="left">PAGAN AND CHRISTIAN CREEDS. By <span class="smcap">Edward Carpenter</span>. Allen &amp; Unwin.
10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>No one would deny the correspondence between much of the theology and ceremonial
of the Christian religion and previous creeds. What significance is to be attached to
that correspondence will depend on the bias of the student. The Christian historian
will see in the facts of anthropology evidence that Christianity is a natural as well as
a revealed religion, and that its claims are greatly strengthened just because of pagan
premonitions. The sceptic may be inclined to dismiss all Christian refinement of older
myths as so much rubbish, of which the world must be rid before it can live coldly
in the bleak light of a scientific materialism. Anyhow, there seems little advantage in
anyone writing elaborately on the subject who is not a scholar. Mr. Carpenter is amiable,
occasionally interesting, more often merely garrulous, but he seems to have no claims to
scholarship, nor, what is ever fatal, to be able to estimate the value of previous scholars'
works. One instance will suffice. He names the few eccentrics, Drews, Robertson, Bossi,
Jensen, who deny the historicity of Jesus Christ; calls it a "large and learned body of
opinion," and adds that "a still larger (but less learned) body fights desperately for
the actual historicity of Jesus." The statement is really absurd. Not to mention orthodox
scholars, Harnack alone could swallow his "learned body" without feeling discomfort.</p>

<p>His own method shows too great an eagerness to produce parallels at all costs. He
notes that many gods, Dionysus, Mithra, Osiris were born in caves; Jesus Christ was
born in a stable. But why call a stable an underground chamber? The facts are twisted
to suit his theory; indeed, the whole book reminds one of those strained allegorical
treatises which were common in the Middle Ages. The principal flaw in his book, as in
all similar essays, is that he never approaches the records of the different religions, to
which he is comparing Christianity, with a hundredth part of the severity he applies
to Christian documents. He does not even discuss the age of manuscripts, a question
of the first importance in the problem of religious origins. How many religions can
show pre-Christian manuscript authority for the traits which, in the absence of that
evidence, we may have believed were borrowed from Christianity itself?</p>

<h3>ANTHROPOLOGY</h3>

<h4 class="left">MAN&mdash;PAST AND PRESENT. By <span class="smcap">A. H. Keane</span>. Revised and largely rewritten
by <span class="smcap">A. Hingston Quiggin</span> and <span class="smcap">A. C. Haddon</span>. Cambridge University Press. 36<i>s.</i></h4>

<p>What are the chief natural divisions of mankind, and how did they come to be formed?
Such is the specific problem of ethnology, and it is one on which the whole body of the
anthropological sciences may be said to converge. In a sense physical anthropology&mdash;that
is to say, the study of the bodily characters of man&mdash;has the most direct bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">748</a></span>
on the subject. The members of the human family are distinguished by marked
differences of physique, which are clearly to a large extent the product of heredity.
On the other hand, adaptation to environment must tend to confine each variety to the
most suitable area; so that geography, in the specialised form known as anthropo-geography,
will be required to help the argument out. Moreover, the history of culture,
as variously comprising ideas, institutions, arts, and languages, provides important
evidence of those movements and clashings of peoples whereby our ever-shifting
balance has been maintained between the forces making severally for a differentiation
and for a fusion of types. Nor is it enough for the ethnologist to keep his eye fixed on
the existing distribution of these types over the wide surface of the globe. His outlook
as it turns towards the past must embrace a tract of time even more formidably wide,
inasmuch as we can never hope to explore it as thoroughly. Altogether, the speculative
problem is as baffling as it is alluring. On the practical side, too, there is the question
to be faced how far civilisation can afford to experiment in the direction of race-amalgamation&mdash;whether,
in short, physical diversity is or is not compatible with moral
unity within the kingdom of man.</p>

<p>Dr. A. H. Keane, for some time Professor of Hindustani at University College,
London, was born in 1833 and died in 1912. He was the only Englishman in post-Darwinian
times to attempt a grand synthesis of the facts relating to the origin and
interrelation of the main human groups. In <i>Ethnology</i> (1896) and <i>Man&mdash;Past and
Present</i> (1899) he put forward what is in effect the same theory&mdash;one to which he
adhered for the rest of his days, as may be gathered from his article on Ethnology in
Hastings' <i>Dictionary of Religion and Ethics</i>, published in the year of his death. This
theory amounted to a vindication on evolutionary grounds of Linnæus' genealogical
tree of the human family, with its four branches, the Æthiopian, Mongolian, American,
and Caucasian. Keane postulated that these primary groups were independently derived
from a common primeval ancestry, first the negro family branching off, then somewhat
later the Caucasian and Mongolo-American splitting out of the main stem. Thereupon
he brought geography into play, supposing each type to develop in an isolated "cradle-land"
where its fundamental characters became fixed, so that no subsequent intermingling
could wholly obliterate them. Nor is it for him simply a question of physical
differentiation. There are mental and moral peculiarities likewise that go with the
race, and these are reflected in markedly divergent outgrowths of culture. On the strength
of these assumptions it was possible to construct a highly systematic account of mankind
in the mass. For the big differences were taken as established at the outset once
for all; whereas the myriad smaller differences that actually distinguish the peoples
of the earth were regarded as mere aberrations from these primary norms.</p>

<p>Twenty-one years, however, of further discovery do not confirm this bold explanation
of the genesis of human diversity, but even militate against it in a negative way,
in so far as some of Keane's most trusted proofs are shown to be invalid. The great
antiquity, for instance, of certain fossil men found in America turns out to be by no
means so certain as he was ready to believe, and the claim of the New World to rank
as an area of primary characterisation is correspondingly weakened. Again, a great deal
more is now known about the racial types of Pleistocene Europe, and their multiplicity
is hard to reconcile with the view that in early times a given geographical province
would foster a single well-marked variety. Thus, so far as regards the prehistoric
evidence, the bottom is pretty well knocked out of the theory; and thereupon the
genetic significance of the attempted classification of types disappears, unless a new
theory of origin can be substituted.</p>

<p>Now to attempt such a reconstruction of the whole argument is a task which no
editor as such could well undertake, for he must in that case assume responsibility for
every word that appears, the original author being reduced to a mute shade in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">749</a></span>
background. On the other hand, if the explanation of the present heterogeneity of mankind
has become more difficult than ever, the description of it may be improved by
incorporating the results of the latest field work. Hence the questionable pedigree is
withdrawn; but the list of the surviving members of the human family is carefully
revised. A systematic appearance is imparted to the catalogue by dividing up the
groups according to the nature of their hair. This leaves Keane's classification almost
unaltered in its surface appearance, since his Æthiopians form the woolly-haired
division, his Caucasians the wavy-haired, the only difference being that the Australians
who count as wavy-haired must now come across from the negroids, of whose characters
they otherwise appear to possess a share. As for the Mongolians and Americans, since
both alike are straight-haired, they need no longer be kept apart. It is a clever feat of
substitution, yet is one that is of little use to the student of the evolutionary problem.
The systematist gets on very well with hair as his differentia until the question of
development is raised. He thereupon finds, first, that to relate present types to former
ones is impossible by this means, since prehistoric skulls have lost their hair entirely;
secondly, that the interrelations of present types are not made any clearer, since no
one has worked out the effects of cross-breeding on the hair of the offspring. Thus it is a
scandalous fact that despite the copious interbreeding of whites with woolly-haired
negroes and straight-haired aborigines in America, no trustworthy data are available
from this or any other quarter in regard to the physical results of such miscegenation.
Is waviness of hair a pure or a mixed form, or sometimes one and sometimes the other?
Our authorities do not seem to know; yet, so long as the matter is left undecided,
relationships based on similarity of hair can have no genetic significance.</p>

<p>Another consequence of the suppression of the theory of a radical division of the
human stocks brought about by their development in isolation is that the assignment of
a special kind of mentality to the different races loses most of its point. This never was
a very convincing side of Keane's work, for he seemed to lack the delicacy of touch
needed in order to bring out the subtler shades of meaning in primitive religion, and
hence could hardly do justice to the surest diagnostic of the mental life. As it is, one
is inclined to smile at the drastic characterisations of peoples that survive, without the
excuse of a genetic explanation, in the revised text. Thus the former edition summed up
the Papuasian as "even more cruel than the African Negro." This goes out in the present
edition; but as we read immediately below that the Tasmanian, another branch of the
stock, was "far less cruel," we have lingering doubts about the Papuasian character as
regards the habit of "seeing red." Without altogether denying the possibility of an
ethnic psychology, one may ask what scientific basis is provided for one here. Whether
Keane was right or wrong, he did mean that temperament went with ancestry.
But the present work does not intend us to deduce a man's morality from his hair; so
that the bearing of mental traits on the problem of classification can no longer be regarded
as essential.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is only fair to state that no pains have been spared to secure the
utmost accuracy in the statement of facts. As an ethnology the book may be disappointing,
because it amounts to an admission that Keane's original attempt to construct a
genealogy of the human race outran the evidence. On the other hand, as an ethnographic
conspectus it will be very serviceable to the student. The idealist, too, who is in a hurry
to establish a uniform civilisation for all may here come upon a useful reminder of the
actual diversity of mankind, though he may console himself with the thought that,
as Heracleitus long ago observed, "opposite friction knits the world together."</p>

<h3>SCIENCE</h3>

<h4 class="left">SCIENCE AND LIFE. By <span class="smcap">Frederick Soddy</span>. Murray. 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This is a collection of addresses and articles indicative of the author's activities as a
chemist and as one of the leading figures of Aberdeen University. A proportion of the
addresses may be grouped together as representing successive expressions of one leading
thought, the social advantages which may accrue from an intelligent application
of the method and results of scientific research to the utilisation of natural sources of
energy. "Scientific research is capable of raising the general standard of life, without
limit, by the solution it affords of the material and physical problems that prevent
progress"&mdash;this is one of Professor Soddy's chief themes. The disadvantage, largely
inherent in a collection of such addresses, delivered to different types of audience, is
that, instead of having before us a clearly reasoned and cumulative treatment of the
problems involved, we take up the matter afresh, from a slightly different aspect, in
each separate address and run over very much the same ground, at one time as a member
of the Independent Labour Party, at another as a member of the Aberdeen Chamber
of Commerce, and so on.</p>

<p>There is much overlapping, and a certain feeling is aroused that we are not much
further than we were in the preceding address. Nevertheless, the problems which
Professor Soddy handles are of such importance that, while we regret that he has not
judged fit to embody the matter of several of his separate addresses in one consecutive
essay, we believe that it is right that his opinion should be placed permanently on
record. Besides these addresses on the place of science in society, we have two popular
expositions of the march of science, in which Professor Soddy has himself made such
notable advances&mdash;one on the Evolution of Matter and one on <i>Radioactive Change</i>.
The views on the transmutations of the elements, which attracted much attention in
the daily Press, are not, of course, new, but the account is remarkably clear and affords
an excellent summary of the present state of the science of radioactivity, which can be
understood by the average reader. Elsewhere in the book, both in separate articles and
in addresses, there is much criticism, of more or less parochial interest, of the administration
of the Carnegie Trust for the Universities of Scotland.</p>

<h4 class="left">A TEXT-BOOK OF HYGIENE FOR TRAINING COLLEGES. By <span class="smcap">Margaret
Avery</span>. Methuen. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This little book has apparently been written chiefly to help students at training colleges
through their examinations, and suffers from many of the usual faults of cram books.
The information is scrappy, and the style so condensed that in many parts the book reads
more like a series of notes than a connected treatise. A more serious fault is that the
scientific information is not always correct&mdash;for instance, the examination of recruits
and pensioners during the war has disproved the common assertion that the cause of
short sight is reading small print, doing fine sewing, and so on, and has tended to show
that excessive physical exertion of certain types, such as lifting heavy weights, is in
many cases the inducing cause. This is a point of importance to school teachers, as
short sight is aggravated by many of the physical exercises now in vogue. In other cases,
the most recent work is not quoted. But the book is largely redeemed by the very
sane way in which wide social topics, such as temperance and eugenics, are discussed.
The latter subject is handled with a desire to get at the facts, uncoloured by prejudice,
which is to be commended, and Miss Avery seems for the time to get away from the
haunting thought of the examination syllabus. The book will appeal to all interested in
primary school education, for it contains a good deal of information as to actual
conditions in various centres.</p>

<h4 class="left">HERSCHEL. By <span class="smcap">Hector Macpherson</span>. Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.
2<i>s.</i> net.</h4>

<p>This short biography is the latest addition to the "Men of Science" section of the
series "Pioneers of Progress" now being published by the S.P.C.K. It gives an excellent
little account of the life of the older Herschel, and, necessarily, tells us something of his
devoted sister Caroline, probably the first woman to do work of importance in the exact
sciences. A poor German musician, who left&mdash;some say deserted from&mdash;the band of the
Hanoverian Guards to come to England, Herschel built up for himself a considerable
position in the English musical world before he turned his attention to the science in
every branch of which he made magnificent advances. His theory of the stellar system
opened a fresh field for observation and speculation; his studies of Saturn and Mars
gave us our first detailed information about these planets; he discovered Uranus&mdash;loyally
named "Georgium Sidus"&mdash;and binary stars, and contributed important
observations in every department of observational astronomy then known. His theory of
the sun, if ludicrous in the light of our present knowledge, was the first attempt at a
general treatment of solar problems. Considering the small size of the book, Mr.
Macpherson's treatment is remarkably comprehensive, and provides a graphic and
sympathetic sketch of the life and works of the great astronomer.</p>

<h4 class="left">DISCOVERY. A Monthly Popular Journal of Knowledge. No. 1. January, 1920.
6<i>d.</i> net. No. 2. February. John Murray.</h4>

<p>This new periodical appears under distinguished auspices, the trustees of the deed
by which it is maintained being Sir J. J. Thomson, Sir F. G. Kenyon, Professor A. C.
Seward, and Professor R. S. Conway. The object is to give a popular presentation of
advances made "in the chief subjects in which investigation is being actively pursued,"
and it is announced that the articles will be written in plain, simple language. An
imposing list of writers who have made or promised contributions assures us that they
will be authoritative. The purpose of the promoters of this journal is worthy of all
praise, and the articles in the first number range over a wide field of interest, and
include <i>The Secret of Philæ</i> (Professor Conway), <i>The Modern Study of Dreams</i> (Professor
T. H. Pear), and <i>Discovery and Education</i>, written by the Master of Balliol, with
his usual forcefulness and insight. While paying tribute to the spirit of the undertaking,
we venture, with some diffidence, to offer the opinion that in many points the paper
might be much improved by more informed editing. In the first place it does not seem
that any clear idea has been formulated as to the class of reader to whom appeal is to
be made; every author appears to have a different standard of erudition in view. For
instance, is it assumed that to the average reader of the <i>Times</i>, say, the vocabulary of
Dr. Slater Price's article on <i>Smoke Screens at Sea</i>&mdash;chlorinated hydrocarbons, kieselguhr,
thermite, oleum, and so on, offered without a word of explanation&mdash;is plain, simple
language? This article might have been written for professional chemists who want
to know what chemicals have proved suitable for producing smoke screens; that on
<i>Sound Ranging</i>, on the other hand, with its forced breeziness, reads as if intended for
a school magazine. The make-up is not very attractive, not vastly superior to that of
the average parish magazine. The single illustration which adorns the pages is a crude
and amateurish pen-drawing far better omitted, if nothing better could be found. In
short, the paper seems to suffer, at present, from lack of policy as regards public, and
lack of high standards as regards production and illustration. We have no doubt that
experience will rapidly rectify these minor points, and we sincerely hope that the paper
will find its public and develop its sphere of usefulness.</p>

<h2>BOOK-PRODUCTION NOTES</h2>

<p class="center">By J. H. MASON</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> <i>Gazette du Bon Ton</i>, now beginning its third year, is so extraordinarily
clever that it sets one thinking about the typographical importance of
magazines. It is in them that typography is seen at its liveliest, and it is
a pity that after a comet-like career we frequently lose sight of them. Why
do not British publishers and printers establish an exhibition hall on the
lines of that at the Buchgewerbehaus in Leipzig? The exhibitions should be
varied, not permanent, although there should always be an exhibition connected
with this all-important group of trades. The book-production of one nation after another,
their magazines, their book illustration, their types and posters, their paper, their colour
printing and newspapers would provide ample material. Printing in its many forms
is an almost omnipresent element of our lives, and for this reason the forms it takes are
more important than the much-canvassed forms of modern pictorial art. In the series
of exhibitions there should be one of magazines, particular care being taken to include
those with a limited circulation, or those which were experimental and ran only for a
short period. Gordon Craig's <i>Mask</i>, the <i>Neolith</i>, the <i>Hobbyhorse</i>, the <i>Manchester Playgoer</i>,
the Russian <i>Apollon</i>, the <i>Imprint</i>, the <i>Game</i>, are just a few that occur to me as certainly
not well known, and yet they are all suggestive attempts to deal with magazine typography,
format, paper, and illustration.</p>

<p>The <i>Gazette du Bon Ton</i> would certainly be included in such an exhibition or section
of an exhibition. Its two most important features typographically are its type, a revived
old style based on a design of Nicolas Cochin, and its coloured illustrations. Three sizes
of type are used, in the <i>Avant-Propos</i> a large 18-point, and in the body of the magazine
14-point and 10-point (I give the nearest equivalents in British sizes). The 14-point
is an excellent choice, both in point of weight and scale. I should prefer using it all
through the magazine to form a stable background to the very varied illustrations and
the capricious choice of initials and captions. The fine line illustrations of page 10 are
too light to keep the page together as they are meant to do. The drawings were probably
made without being tested by comparison with the strong line of the type. The illustrations,
in black with one or two flat tints or full colours, give a real colour value that
is never obtained by the three-colour process. Take any book illustrated by this process
and test it by comparison with these <i>Bon Ton</i> colours, and if the colour sense has not
been vitiated by a wrong standard for coloured letterpress illustrations&mdash;such as oil
paintings&mdash;the superiority of the flat colour will be obvious. Even the chiaroscuro block
prints are capable of very pleasing effects, a hint of them appearing in the tail-piece
on page 4.</p>

<p>The "<i>Gazette du Bon Ton</i> continuera d'être ... le lieu où les couturiers et
les peintres collaborent pour composer la silhouette de leur temps." That sentence from
the <i>Avant-Propos</i> sums up what I have to say of the type, the illustration, and the
work as a whole. The large type attracts attention at once, it spreads itself a little&mdash;a
shade wide&mdash;it slightly emphasises its idiosyncrasies (see the y with its terminal serif,
or the s, or the capital G, they have the very accent of our own time); it is elegant, but
not content with elegance; it is on a good model, but perfection, the golden mediocrity,
is felt as constraint; it attains&mdash;reaches something a little <i>outré</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;Last month I inadvertently wrote Luckombe for Stower, although the
latter's <i>Printer's Grammar</i> was on my table at the time.</p>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">THE</span> list of plays which I have selected from those I have seen during the
last month is not without interest. It contains one play which is not
Tchekhov's finest work, but which nevertheless has no rival among the
others on the list, and it was performed for exactly one afternoon by the
Art Theatre under Madame Donnet. The plays next in merit&mdash;Euripides'
<i>Medea</i> and Shaw's <i>Candida</i>&mdash;were given by Mr. Lewis Casson and Mr. Bruce Winston
at <i>matinées</i> at the Holborn Empire for exactly one week each. Shaw's <i>Pygmalion</i> and
Daisy Ashford's <i>The Young Visiters</i> may be expected to run&mdash;the former in proportion
to its merits, the latter in no equality at all, either with its notoriety or its charm&mdash;for a
couple of months. At a considerable distance comes Mr. Ervine's <i>John Ferguson</i>, a play
which, if considered by the side of those I have already named, must be ranked very
low, but if considered with all those I have not named&mdash;now being played at London
theatres&mdash;must be ranked as respectably good, neither very much better nor very much
worse than the average West-End theatrical entertainment. For <i>John Ferguson</i>, like <i>Tea
for Three</i> at the Haymarket, is an entertainment, only it does not make you laugh; it
entertains you as a street accident does&mdash;a very bloody street accident. Finally&mdash;leaving
out the Russian Miniature Theatre, which is really Ballet&mdash;we come to <i>Grierson's Way</i>,
the resuscitated by-product of Mr. H. V. Esmond. Here we come to a play that&mdash;if, as
our tabulation almost suggests, plays run in inverse proportion to their merit&mdash;should
run for ever.</p>

<p>Of Tchekhov's <i>The Three Sisters</i> I shall not attempt to say much. Like all Tchekhov's
plays, it must be extraordinarily difficult to act, and I did not think that, on the whole,
it was acted very well, although Miss Dorothy Massingham (Irina), Miss Helena Millais
(Natasha), Mr. Tom Nesbitt (Audrey), Mr. Leyton Cancellor (Chebutikin), Mr. William
Armstrong (Kuligin), and others made praiseworthy and not altogether unsuccessful
efforts to present the characters they were playing. There was also something very
plausible and real about Mr. Harcourt Williams's Vershinin, and Mr. Williams has a
great advantage in his voice. It was the production rather than the acting that was at
fault, but, inadequate as it may have been, it could not prevent the extraordinary force
of the play making itself felt.</p>

<p>There are some people who would call Tchekhov a realist and <i>The Three Sisters</i> realism,
but it is Mr. Ervine in <i>John Ferguson</i> who is the realist, if by that one means reproducing
on the stage as closely as practicable what might be happening off it, with the action
and language rendered as faithfully as possible. It was probably Mr. Ervine's knowledge of
this fact, and the serious deficiency which it indicates, that made him introduce the
village idiot to talk about "wee" stars, and give the audience what is always the realist's
idea of a little poetry. As a man of letters, and not a mere theatrical hack, he knows of
the utter barrenness of the photographic reproduction method in art. He probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">756</a></span>
knows also that it is not even enough to select, that the artist must create. Unfortunately
this is just what the mere intellectual, the merely clever man can never do, and when he
is clever enough to know that he must make an attempt at it he produces something like
Mr. Ervine's village idiot, something that is borrowed and extraneous to the real matter power
of the play. The poetry, the creative power of Tchekhov, on the other hand, is immanent
and infuses the whole conception of <i>The Three Sisters</i>. So true is this that when we saw
the play in the auditorium of the Court Theatre we felt that it was our lives we were
watching, our destinies we were seeing played out; and this in spite of the fact that
every detail of the scene was strange, every custom unfamiliar, and the wealth of local
colour such as to produce a sensuous impression as strong as music.</p>

<p>Nothing extraordinary happens in Tchekhov's play. The characters meet, talk, fall in
love, part, die in the casual way in which we all do these things&mdash;the actual events in
Mr. Ervine's play are far less usual, just as a street accident is an occurrence less frequent
than afternoon tea; but the whole play is an imaginative expression of the inner feelings
of three human beings&mdash;the three sisters. It is extraordinarily imaginative, that is the
point I want to make, and it is useless to ask me why it is imaginative&mdash;that is Tchekhov's
secret. You never feel this is what actually happened three hundred miles from Moscow
in the year 1892; you feel, on the contrary, that this never happened at all, but that it
is what goes on inside us, millions of us, all the years of our lives, although it may never
or very rarely come up to the surface of our consciousness and fill us with the spiritual
agony of <i>The Three Sisters</i>. In Mr. Ervine's play, on the other hand, although, as I have
said, the actual events are in themselves of less common occurrence, we meet with
something that we feel certain must have happened yesterday and will happen to-morrow,
and its significance, somehow, seems to be <i>nil</i>. What artistic or spiritual significance
has a collision in the Strand between a taxi-cab and a lamp-post? Whatever significance
it has, it is that kind of significance that Mr. Ervine's play possesses.</p>

<p>If <i>The Young Visitors</i> had been produced by that Russian Society called Zahda, or
by the Russian Miniature Theatre, it would have been hailed as a wonderful masterpiece
of bizarre and original art, and all the young freaks of London who frequent the
Russian Ballet and sneer at Gilbert and Sullivan would have flocked to see it and talked
of nothing else for months. As it is a product, however, of the despised English&mdash;the
English who have produced the greatest imaginative literature of the world&mdash;and as
also it has the misfortune to have been in its book form enormously popular, there is
little likelihood of its being adequately appreciated. I must confess, however, that by
the side of Mr. J. V. Bryant's production of Miss Daisy Ashford's <i>The Young Visiters</i>,
the productions I have so far seen of the Zahda Art Council, which includes men of
ambitious mind, and of the Russian Miniature Theatre have been distinctly <i>jejune</i> and
unexhilarating. <i>The Young Visiters</i> is the later Victorian world looked at from the eyes
of a child. It is, therefore, a fantasy, and the note of fantasy has been admirably struck
in the stage production. Those who have read the book will naturally imagine that it
is spoiled upon the stage, but they will be wrong. It is even conceivable that some&mdash;there
are such people&mdash;who have not liked the book will enjoy the play immensely.
They should, at all events, not let any distaste of the book's vogue prevent their seeing
the play, if they have the opportunity. They will be rewarded by Mr. Harold Anstruther's
marvellous presentment of that wonderful creation Bernard Clark. He is a masterpiece
in costume, voice, gesture, and make-up, and I expect I shall have to wait a good many
years before our Russian friends give us anything comparable for excellence with him.
Another perfect&mdash;the word perfect is accurate&mdash;presentment is Mr. John Deverell's
Earl of Clincham&mdash;the earl who thought that the glories of this world were but "piffle
before the wind." Mr. Lawrence Hanray's Procurio is also perfect. I have never used
the word perfect about any acting before, so there is obviously some magic about <i>The
Young Visiters</i> to have three parts played perfectly. I wish I could say the same of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">757</a></span>
delightful person Mr. Salteena. Mr. Ben Field's effort is by no means without merit,
but he does not satisfy our preconceived notion of what Mr. Salteena ought to be, as
the others do for Bernard Clark, Clincham, and Procurio. Nevertheless, as we get more
used to Mr. Field's Salteena we get more satisfied with him. We never, unfortunately,
became satisfied with Miss Edyth Goodall's Ethel Morticue, clever as Miss Goodall
undeniably is. Miss Goodall's Ethel is sophisticated, Ethel was not. The Prince of Wales
at the Levee was excellent, and the Duchess's singing of <i>Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay</i> superb.
It was an inspiration to think of it.</p>

<p>Of Mr. Esmond's play, <i>Grierson's Way</i>, I should say no more if it were not that it has
been praised by the same critics who have written of the "filth" of Dryden's <i>Marriage
à la Mode</i>. Those of us who pride ourselves on a somewhat catholic taste, who can see
the good points of a revue, a musical comedy, a melodrama, a farce, and a tragedy,
who find that, although we may prefer Webster, Dryden, and Tchekhov to Shaw, and
Shaw to Arnold Bennett, and Arnold Bennett to Oscar Asche, we are none the less able
to be amused by the Pounds sisters in <i>Pretty Peggy</i>, and to enjoy Alfred Lester in <i>The
Eclipse</i>&mdash;those of us, let me add, who do not turn scarlet at the sight of a bare back are
still&mdash;strange as it may appear to the pharisaical and the prudish&mdash;not without moral
sense. And <i>Grierson's Way</i> is a play that offends <i>our</i> moral sense. It is, I would venture
to add&mdash;using the word with its true but not its current popular meaning&mdash;a thoroughly
immoral play. That is to say its ideas are false, its sentiment slobbery, and thoroughly
rotten with the rottenness of bad fruit. It is worth discussing the play because so few
people know a bad thing when they see it. They judge by externals, not by the spirit,
for the simple reason that it is so very much easier. Their idea of morality is like that of
the old lady who overheard her gardener say "Damn" and said "What a bad wicked
man!" and dismissed him, although he was an honest, good-hearted fellow, to put in
his place a smooth-tongued, insincere rogue who cheated her for the rest of her life.
Of course it served her right; men and women have no excuse to throw up the task of
feeling and thinking after real righteousness and beauty in Art or Life for the easy rule-of-thumb
method of judging everything by rote or formula. No doubt it is terribly
difficult for many of them to feel either beauty or ugliness, good or evil, but without
that sensitiveness of the intelligence they can never hope to criticise the productions
of the human mind. The foot-rule, whether it is a rule for measuring "damns" or split
infinitives, or rapes or murders, or the number of bare backs in a play, is useless for
measuring its artistic quality, and a play can have no other quality, provided its murders
are not real and its indecencies not practised before our eyes.</p>

<p>In <i>Grierson's Way</i> we have the story of a girl who is loved by a middle-aged bachelor
who has a maundering delight in bad music, and also by a once famous violinist, who
has lost an arm in an accident, and now is a doddering drunkard, who talks of Art and
his soul in the approved manner of the sentimentalist who does not realise what an
offence his sickly, insincere slobber is to any profoundly-feeling, austere, and clear-brained
artist. The girl has fallen in love with an Army man of the conventional novelette type,
who is already married; she is about to have a child by him when she gets a letter from
him to say that he is going away and will never see her again. The middle-aged bachelor
offers to marry her as a way out of the difficulty; she accepts. The man she loves
returns, his wife having died, and the husband, at the instigation of the violinist, commits
suicide. The curtain falls leaving this creature expressing with sickly gusto his opinion
that the dead husband will now stand for ever between her and her happiness. This
account of the play's theme can give no idea of the false sentiment, the maudlin splutter
of fine words, and the melodramatic rant with which the play is loaded. Miss Cathleen
Nesbitt strove to preserve some personal dignity in the foul mush of words that flowed
from the invertebrate jelly-fish around her, but nothing she could do could redeem the
play, which is, frankly, disgusting.</p>

<h3>DRAMATIC LITERATURE</h3>

<h4 class="left">PROBLEMS OF THE PLAYWRIGHT. By <span class="smcap">Clayton Hamilton</span>. Allen &amp;
Unwin. 7<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i></h4>

<p>This is a book by an American critic, and it ranges over almost the whole field of
dramatic art. Although it consists mainly of articles reprinted from American magazines,
it is on a much higher general level of intelligence and taste than we are accustomed to
expect from work of this kind. Mr. Hamilton discusses all the modern English dramatists,
and, although he is not free from his countrymen's tendency to exaggerated praise&mdash;for
instance, few English critics of reputation would endorse his opinion that <i>Hindle
Wakes</i> is "a great work"&mdash;yet he is far from being undiscriminating, and his criticism
of Mr. Shaw and Mr. Galsworthy is penetrating and fresh. Mr. Hamilton has the great
merit of thinking for himself instead of merely repeating the current catchwords of the
day. He is not afraid to argue that Henry Arthur Jones and Pinero are finer dramatists
than Mr. Bernard Shaw, but, on the other hand, he can appreciate Mr. Chesterton and
Lord Dunsany. Again, he is full of ingenious suggestions on the subject of dramatic
construction, but he is far more conscious of the foolishness of dogmatising and laying
down hard-and-fast rules than such a good critic even as Mr. William Archer, to whom
his book is dedicated. On the subject of American plays, as represented by the work of
Mr. George M. Cohan, he is scathingly severe, and that is a good omen for the future
of the drama in America.</p>

<h2>THE FINE ARTS</h2>

<h3>AUGUSTE RENOIR</h3>

<p class="drop-cap4"><span class="smcap1">RENOIR</span> is admired by almost all schools of taste, both conservative and radical,
and naturally each school endeavours to claim him as its own. The impressionists,
for instance, emphasise his adoption of the impressionist palette, his studies
in the manner of Monet and Pisarro, his general preoccupation with atmosphere
and sunlight; the anti-impressionists point out his deviation from the
stippled technique, with its juxtaposition of the colours of the spectrum, his increasing
interest in form and composition as contrasted with atmosphere, and his own
disclaimer of adherence to the naturalistic principle: "Avec la Nature on fait ce
qu'on veut et on aboutit necessairement a l'isolement. Moi, je reste dans le rang";
also the famous reply to the question, where one should learn painting: "Au musée,
parbleu!"</p>

<p>The reflections upon art of even the greatest artist are not necessarily correct, and
though an artist preaches one theory he may actually practise another. Nor are these
brief and pithy utterances of Renoir's altogether unambiguous. In order to appreciate
the real meaning of any statement of theory it is necessary to bear in mind the opposite
view which it is combating. We cannot infer from Renoir's objection to the indiscriminate
realism of the later impressionist doctrine that he was in favour of Cubism,
for Cubism was not at the time under discussion. Nor does his reference of students
to the old masters (<i>au musée</i>) imply in the least that he would abolish painting from
nature. There is, in fact, not the slightest need to read into Renoir's simple, somewhat
irritated replies any abstruse semi-metaphysical meaning. They will bear a very normal
interpretation, which seems to me to be not only the true one, but also the truth.
Renoir did not believe in the chaotic and uninspired painting of anything and everything,
nor in the pretended complete severance with tradition and the past. He knew
that the study of the old masters had assisted him in giving expression to his emotion,
and he left the matter at that. Actually all his life long he painted from nature, and it
is said that he hardly ever worked without a model. Indeed many of the intellectualists
have been compelled to class Renoir as a "naïf," who was content with the unmediated
charms of the external world, and never aspired to more deliberate abstract construction.</p>

<h4 class="left">The Meaning of Impressionism</h4>

<p>This distinction, however, between the realistic impressionist (Monet), the naïf
(Renoir and the <i>douanier</i> Rousseau), and the intellectually constructive artist, such as
Cézanne, is apt to be thoroughly misleading. It is true that the theory of impressionism,
in its later developments, was a scientific formula calculated to fetter rather than help
the artist, but it does not follow, nor is it by any means true, that Monet and Pisarro
were not sometimes very fine artists. They elaborated a style which expressed admirably
their own brisk and vivacious sentiment, and the result was neither photographic nor
discontinuous with the past. Surely nothing but prejudice and the new pedantry of
hybrid abstract design could deny æsthetic value to Monet's "Gare St. Lazare," and
Pisarro's "Red Roofs," in the Luxembourg. Often, however, Monet's work is distinctly
laboured and only differentiated from a photograph by the worried surface of
the paint. He is more monotonous and uninspired than his contemporaries, but he is
none the less the author of some remarkably good prose descriptions.</p>

<p>In short, impressionism has come to stand for two quite distinct things: one a
genuine attempt to articulate an emotion connected with light and atmosphere, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">760</a></span>
other a scientific theory of colour and light. With the latter, few of the important
impressionists were concerned. Seurat is the only one who seems to have been influenced
to any noticeable extent and yet to have remained an artist. But with the former the
whole group were more or less concerned, including Renoir and Cézanne. They all
revolted from the old sombre colours, expressive of the worship of hoary antiquity,
and astonished their contemporaries by plunging into the brightness of the present.
Their different modes of reacting to this general tendency were the natural result of
eminently desirable differences in temperament. This is the essence of the divergence
between, say, Monet, Renoir, and Cézanne. For the very reason that they each possessed
a personal vision their work differed, both technically and in its content. It simply is a
misrepresentation to say that Cézanne indulged in Cubist deformations. To quote a
biographer of Cézanne:&mdash;"Ce sont ses disciples, ses plagiaires qui raconte qu'il deforme.
Ses deformations, que des cuistres voient si bien, eux qui ne sont pas peintres, ce sont
des gestes, des attitudes, des contours <i>vrais</i> pour Cézanne. Il ne voyait pas autrement."</p>

<p>Of course it is possible to soak oneself in Cézanne to such an extent that almost
everything else will seem uninteresting. But this is not a magnetism peculiar to Cézanne;
it is common to all artists of any comprehensive range, not excepting Renoir. Pass
quickly after enjoying a collection of Renoir's completest and most lucid work to some
of Cézanne's paintings. Most probably they will appear wooden and unattractive. But
this will be a psychological illusion, due to a sudden contrast and the fact that the whole
of one's emotional consciousness has been shaped to a certain form, and will not immediately
reshape itself. Our minds at any single moment are unable to contain more than
a few powerful conceptions and impressions, and there must therefore be times of
clashing and transition.</p>

<p>But there is a sense in which Renoir might very well be described as naïf and ingenuous.
This would refer not to his method or technique, but to the spiritual content of his
work, what he means and has to say. The centre of his enjoyment lay always in something
charming, radiant, opulent, and, if you like, sensuous. And so those who are
ascetically disposed, if not in their life, in their tastes, condemn Renoir as pretty and
sentimental. But often they go further and conclude that he was facile, that he painted
without difficulty or trouble, as the birds sing. It may, however, have been as difficult
for him to attain a satisfactory expression of his emotion, which was <i>of</i> facility, as it
was for Cézanne to express his intense consciousness of beauty struck out of conflicting
opposites. Indeed, very often there are distinct indications of a struggle in Renoir, of
inability to get exactly what he was aiming at. A superficial glance might put this down
to bad elementary draughtsmanship. But one has only to consider the technical proficiency
of his earlier work (see "Le Cabaret de la Mere Antony, Diane Chasseresse")
to realise that the cause of this apparent ineptitude must be deeper. It is the honesty
of the artist who is always developing and refuses to overcome difficulties by resort
to the camouflage of the obvious and the hackneyed. Consequently the very failure has
its appeal.</p>

<h4 class="left">Different Periods</h4>

<p>There is a great deal of difference of opinion as to the respective value of Renoir's
earlier and his later work, and this has afforded an excellent opportunity for the conflicting
schools, who all join in admiring Renoir, to set up within this ostensible "union
sacrée" their old party divisions. The conservatives adhere, of course, to the first great
period from 1870&ndash;1881; that is to say between Renoir's thirtieth and fortieth years.
In the rest they see a gradual decline of inspiration, an increasing predilection for
rotund and almost coarse sensuousness, a pathetic loss of technical power until, when
tortured by gout and hopelessly paralysed, the old master could only apply chaotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">761</a></span>
dabs of hot and hotter colour, his work became worthless. The extremists, on the other
hand, see a steady, though uneven, development. They admit readily the enchantment
of the period of early maturity when Renoir was at the height of his physical powers,
but they have an uncomfortable feeling that this kind of art is a trifle too normal, it is
something that practically anyone can enjoy with a little effort. The later work is more
difficult. Renoir never lost his peculiar charm, even when painting the fattest of models
(his model, I think, just grew fatter), but he experimented in different directions, passing
from the study of light more and more to that of form. Latterly, when an invalid, he
was compelled to confine himself within narrower bounds, and the appeal of his work
has less volume in it. Nevertheless, it is maintained these last are the two greatest periods,
if not in positive achievement, at any rate in intention.</p>

<p>I am disposed, if anything, to favour the work done in the first two phases, between
his thirtieth and sixtieth years, and I am not sure that some of his most perfect pictures
do not belong to the earlier of the two. For he did not produce many perfect pictures;
it is nearly always possible to trace some defect. For instance, there has recently been
exhibited at the Eldar Gallery one of the remarkable series of "Baigneuses." This
particular canvas was painted in 1888. There is a great deal that is very beautiful in it,
but it is not a whole. It is a "studio" picture, the nude and the landscape have no
inevitable connection, and little interest is displayed in the face. Further, the body
is cut off, or rather smoothed off, from its environment by a swish of paint, which
signifies nothing, except that Renoir became too excited by the actual touch and feel
and putting on of the paint, and also that he had an <i>idée fixe</i> about the gradual merging
of the outline into its surroundings. This was the sentimental echo of his former
genuine enthusiasm for <i>plein-air</i> effects. In many of his otherwise admirable figure
studies this spongy film (especially affecting the hands) spoils the precision of his
rendering. Sometimes, however, it is appropriate; for instance, in the famous picture,
"La Moulin de la Galette" (1876). Here the flowing atmospheric technique and the
significance coincide. The radiant coolness of the dappled light and shade is expressed
with a freedom and spontaneity which is often lacking in Monet and Pisarro. Yet in
spite of the unalloyed delight of this dancing scene I always feel a lurking criticism.
This is not because of the kind of sentiment which might be mistaken for sentimentality;
it is due to something else, a sameness and repetition. There is an absence of diversity
in these light-hearted revellers; in fact they are just one man and one woman duplicated
many times over, and flushed with exactly the same translucent emotion. Renoir did
not possess great constructive imaginative power, and he had very little interest in
character. This general limitation, however, only became a concrete limitation (that is
to say, a defect observable inside a picture, instead of one of the infinite things that the
picture is not) when he was actually portraying some scene necessitating a variety of
individual characters.</p>

<p>It is in some of his landscapes, or in portrait heads such as that of Madame Charpentier,
or studies such as "La Loge," and some of the later nudes that there is the completest
fusion of the content and the form, of the technique and the emotion. It is
frequently said that Renoir was not a landscape painter, but was <i>par excellence</i> a painter
of women or of woman. The latter statement undoubtedly has some truth in it, although
the interest was not so much in woman as in a particular roseate emotion, more evident
in women than in men. But he was also a very considerable landscape painter, and his
figures of women are usually placed in the open air, amid scenery possessing the same
soft and sweeping texture. Even when an invalid he still painted out of doors, in a specially
constructed glass house, while his model posed, often naked, in his garden.</p>

<p>About 1881 he seems to have exhausted his direct interest in the <i>plein-air</i> movement.
Incidentally, he took a journey to Italy, but there is no evidence of any influence
of this visit upon his work, except that it may have served to throw into stronger relief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">762</a></span>
the peculiarities of the French school and his own kinship with it&mdash;that school which
(in his own phrase) "est si gentille, si clair, de si bonne compagnie."</p>

<p>This, however, is least applicable to the artist towards whom his own inner development
seems to have guided him, namely Ingres. To put it in the usual superficial and
rather unsatisfactory way, he was passing from the study of light to that of two dimensional
form. The actual result was a synthesis in which brilliant colour and light played
a part never dreamt of by Ingres. At first his work showed an unusual hardness and
lack of skill. He never possessed the sureness of touch of Manet, which often was mere
virtuosity; nor does one ever feel behind his hand the overwhelming impetuosity of
Van Gogh. He feels his way gradually, producing a great deal, in fact too much, and
succeeding only in certain moments. The culmination was reached in the large composition
of the four bathers (which I have not seen) in the collection of M. J. E. Blanche.
Opinion seems to differ as to its value, but, whatever defects it may possess, it is clearly
of a monumental character, and probably represents the highest point that Renoir was
able to attain in the attempt to bring together the sculpturesque qualities of one of his
first large compositions, "Diane Chasseresse," and the luminosity and richness of the
"Moulin de la Galette."</p>

<p>Between the years 1885 and 1897 there followed a whole succession of remarkable
pictures, including "Les Enfants Benard," "Mère et Enfant," "Les Filles de Catulle
Mendès," "Les Parapluies," and "Au Piano," of which there are two examples, one
being at the Luxembourg. Although Renoir was moving away from his former softness
and mistiness, as if in dissatisfaction with the youthful joy in mere sensation, he never
left it right behind, he remained on the borderland and looked back on it, contemplating
it with maturer insight.</p>

<h4 class="left">About 1900 to 1919</h4>

<p>The last stage constituted a partial return to the first; he reverted to his former
freedom and suppleness of touch. But the method is more direct and the content more
realistic and crude, although there is still the same lyrical tenderness. His colours are
bolder and hotter, and it is alleged that he strengthened them purposely with a view to
their being modified by time. This appears to me a most dangerous doctrine. How
could one ever be certain that the present wrong tones would be altered by exposure to
exactly the correct tones? And why put oneself to such pain in the present for the sake
of an uncertain future? For it must be very painful to a sensitive artist to create something
out of tone, even on purpose. For these reasons (and without the backing of any
authority) I rather doubt whether there is much truth in this intended excuse. And I
doubt whether any excuse is necessary. I believe that in the majority of cases Renoir
meant something by this hotter colour, and that in this respect the pictures are their
own justification. It is impossible to hail all of them as masterpieces. Many definitely
betray loss of vitality and imagination. But I cannot agree that the work of this period
is that of an invalided old man who is living sentimentally on his past.</p>

<p>There has recently been on view, at the Chelsea Book Club, a collection of oil paintings
and pastels by Renoir. Some of them were relatively unimportant earlier works, but the
majority belonged to the later period. None of them, with the exception, perhaps, of a
flower piece and a small head of a woman, can be ranked very high; but they indicate
the limits and at the same time the mellow charm of the work of this time. This charm
is not perhaps immediately felt; it grows upon one, but it is quite real. In his old age
Renoir remained as much as ever a poet, only his poetry is thinner and more fragile.</p>

<p>Renoir was born in 1841 and died in 1919. Of his famous contemporaries only Claude
Monet is still alive.</p>

<h2>MUSIC</h2>

<h3>THE NATURALIZATION OF OPERA IN ENGLAND</h3>

<p class="drop-cap3"><span class="smcap1">IN</span> Italy opera is a tree which has sprung from a seed and grown swiftly in the course
of centuries to an exuberant, perhaps an over-exuberant, maturity. It has been fertilised
from other countries, but its trunk has kept one firm straight line by its own
perfectly natural development. In England that tree has not flourished. Various
attempts have been made to naturalize it, but for the most part the English cultivators
never produced more than stunted and distorted growths. Even when they
seemed to do well for a time they bore curiously little resemblance to their original
parent. Other gardeners, observing how meagrely the tree prospered in the open ground,
transplanted opera full-grown from Italy, and did their best to provide it artificially
with its own soil and its own climate. It was an expensive amusement, and the more
expensive it was the more successful its promoters proclaimed it to be. But it could not
be called naturalization. The only course which has shown any signs of being practicable
was to graft the foreign shoot on to a sturdy native growth, if a suitable stock could be
found. But it is a process requiring careful handling and careful watching, for the tree
takes a long time to become thoroughly acclimatized.</p>

<p>It is pretty generally agreed that English opera must be preceded by opera in English.
Our public&mdash;our real public, that is to say, not the handful of people who concentrate a
special attention on opera, both English and foreign&mdash;will not be ready to take new
native operas to their hearts until they have got thoroughly into the habit of enjoying
those popular works which form the international repertory. Those operas&mdash;<i>Faust</i>,
<i>Carmen</i>, <i>Il Trovatore</i>, and the rest&mdash;are popular in England already, it will be said.
Yes, as operas go, they are indeed popular; but only among those people, in whatever
section of society, who have developed the opera habit. For even in what are called the
popular theatres, where they are played in English to cheap and crowded audiences,
they are almost always exotic still. If it were not that a large majority of operas are called
by the names of their principal characters, we should see more significance in the fact
that we speak of the others in nearly every case by their native titles, and do not translate
them. We have learnt to talk of <i>The Magic Flute</i> and <i>The Flying Dutchman</i>; but even
at the "Old Vic." they keep the names of <i>Il Trovatore</i>, <i>La Traviata</i>, and <i>Cavalleria
Rusticana</i>.</p>

<p>Wherever they are played by English singers in English theatres they remain, as it
were, extra-territorial. To begin with, the translations of nearly all popular operas are
abominable. This has been said many times before. But what has not been said so often
is that, abominable as they are, there is hardly an opera-singer who is willing to learn a
new translation, even when it is candidly admitted that the new translation is easier to
sing than the old one. There are plenty of sound reasons for this apparent obstinacy.
It is not due merely to laziness or to the vested interests of publishers. What is far more
important is that a new translation, if it is really good, involves a new style of singing,
a new style of acting, a new scheme for the entire production of the opera. The average
opera-singer learns his parts in a spirit of routine. He cannot waste time over trying to
find out the plot of the opera or to analyse the personalities of the characters. He learns
the traditions and is ready to step into his part without rehearsal in any operatic company
that may happen to engage him. It may sound very shocking to the reader that operas
should be put on the stage without any rehearsal whatever; but it is nothing unusual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">764</a></span>
in the world of actual fact. After all, it is not much more unreasonable that an opera
company should sing <i>Maritana</i> without rehearsing than that an orchestra of professionals
should give an unrehearsed performance of the overture to <i>William Tell</i> or the
ballet music from <i>Rosamunde</i>.</p>

<h4 class="left">The Function of the Audience</h4>

<p>Sir Thomas Beecham, when he first formed his opera company, sought out youth,
intelligence and enthusiasm. He began in a brave and gallant spirit, and in his company
there is still something of that spirit left. At the beginning it was hardly expected
that he would do much better than the well-known provincial companies which used
occasionally to give a season in London. But he aimed at storming Covent Garden.
Covent Garden was inaccessible during the war, partly because no foreign singers
were available to fill it, and partly because it was already filled with furniture. The
war ended, the old Covent Garden exotic opera reappeared. Sir Thomas, however,
did not leave its territory inviolate, and he is now in complete possession. But Covent
Garden has been too strong for the invaders. Like the barbarians who invaded Italy,
they are becoming Romanised. At Covent Garden there are boxes and box-holders
who adore Melba, Caruso, and the rest. There is a splendid orchestra, there are fine
singers, there is magnificent scenery. But the longer the company stays there the less
chance there seems to be of their preparing the way for the real English opera of the
future.</p>

<p>What English opera wants is an audience. And the best audience that I have ever seen
in any opera-house in Europe is the audience at the "Old Vic." Italian audiences are
reputed to be appreciative; but they are interested primarily in singing and in little else.
They are critical of this only, and they have a certain tendency to be cruel. The "Old
Vic." audience, if it is bored, lets the actors know it; but it is never cruel, and it is
ready to appreciate other things besides mere singing. Once its attention has been secured
there is no audience to equal it for quick intelligence and responsiveness to both tragedy
and comedy. But Covent Garden has no pit, and its gallery is too small and too distant
to assert itself.</p>

<p>Half-way between the "Old Vic." and Covent Garden stands the new enterprise of
Messrs. Miln and Fairbairn, at the Surrey. The Surrey has secured its audience. It
has begun with the old familiar favourites, but it has also included in its repertory
<i>The Flying Dutchman</i> and <i>Don Giovanni</i>, both of which have drawn full houses. Very
wisely the management has not wasted its money on elaborate scenery, though
it is in a position to stage the <i>Flying Dutchman</i> quite adequately, and that is no
small matter. There is an orchestra which, if not large, is at least complete. It began
by being rather rough, and even in <i>Don Giovanni</i>, for which it is just exactly balanced
in proportion of wind and strings, it only too forcibly recalled the criticisms made by
Mozart's contemporaries on his overpowering orchestration. It is in their singers
that Messrs. Miln and Fairbairn have been peculiarly successful. Youth, intelligence,
and enthusiasm are certainly well represented here.</p>

<h4 class="left">The Surrey's Opportunity</h4>

<p>Mr. Fairbairn, who is responsible for the production of the operas, has in this company
a wonderful opportunity, if he will only seize it. Here is a splendid house that combines
the dignity of an eighteenth-century design with the practical convenience of an interior
recently remodelled; an audience with no critical and social pretensions to keep up,
but unsophisticated, appreciative, and alert; and a company of young singers keen to
learn and ready to throw themselves generously into their work. Starting on such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">765</a></span>
basis, the Surrey has every chance to develop into a great and flourishing school of
English opera. But to develop such a school needs more than average courage, initiative,
intelligence, and hard work. It means that gradually, one by one, the translations of all
the standard operas must be thoroughly revised. Along with this revision there must be
a thorough-going revision and reconsideration from the beginning of the system on
which each opera is produced. Tradition must be abandoned if it cannot be justified by
common sense. Each opera must be worked out afresh from the beginning, as if it had
never been put on the stage before. And the director of such a school must be prepared
to face possible hostility towards his revisions. There will always be some among his
audience who prefer the old tradition, good or bad, simply because they like to hear
what they have always heard. Such people have got to be convinced and converted.
That is not impossible. Even operatic audiences have a certain amount of common
sense, and it is to common sense that an operatic producer must not be afraid of appealing.
The plots of most operas are generally admitted to be nonsense, but that is no reason
why one should not make a vigorous effort to put sense into them. Few plots could be
more absurd than that of <i>Il Trovatore</i>; but if Verdi succeeded in writing music that,
by virtue of its persistent directness, its unswerving pursuit of its dramatic end, has
made <i>Il Trovatore</i> one of the greatest operas ever composed, surely it is worth a producer's
while to concentrate attention on making the libretto as clear and as sure of its
dramatic intention as the music is. The translator of an opera must not rest satisfied
with merely translating each line as singably and as reasonably as he can, just as it
happens to come along. He must regard the libretto as a literary whole, must endeavour to
attain some unity of style, and still more to achieve a cumulative dramatic effect by
little touches, significant phrases to fit important musical phrases; he must in each
recitative or aria see at once where the climax is and fit it with a telling point, to which
the rest of the movement will lead up. He must differentiate his characters, giving each
its own literary individuality. If his original text is a bad one he must improve upon it.
There are many cases in which a librettist has had a good idea but has failed to express
it adequately. Sometimes the composer has understood the idea and has clothed the
wretched words with music that lifts them on to a higher plane. The translator here
finds his opportunity, and must do his best to find English words which may express
the poet's intention rather than his actual achievement.</p>

<p>The singer who meets with a good translation is no longer uncomfortable, nervous,
and ashamed about his part. He finds that he can bring home his songs to his audience
in a way that he never could before; he learns to realise his part as a personality, he
may even get as far as beginning to imagine what the character in question might have
said or done when he was not on the stage. In this way the double appeal to the audience
can be made, the appeal that is irresistible, the appeal to their own common sense,
coupled with the overwhelming appeal of real personality in the actor.</p>

<p>If all operatic directors insisted resolutely on good translations and insisted that their
singers should sing them like real natural English, we might develop a really English
school of opera. Our own poets and composers could watch and listen, and possibly
learn something which would guide them in the construction of their own original
librettos and music. They would gradually come to find out what even our song-writers
have only very partially discovered, namely, what are the true dramatic
possibilities of English voices singing English poetry.</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
